[**7-28**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity with fused commissures and
tethering of leaflet motion. There is moderate mitral stenosis.
Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true
mitral valve area. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 F h/o afib, htn, AVR/MVR, presented with 3 day history of
melena, elevated INR, stable hct, transferred from MICU to
medicine service.
.
# GIB - To evaluate her GI bleeding, an EGD and colonoscopy were
performed. Colonoscopy clear. EGD shows antral erosions. H.
pylori studies were negative. Anticoag risk: bigger cardiac/CVA
risk of not anticoagulating, compared to anticoagulation risk
for GIB. She was put on a planned course of [**Hospital1 **] PPI for one
month, and daily PPI thereafter. She was bridged back to
coumadin with a heparin drip, a process which took considerable
time.
.
# HTN: held ACE and BB for concern for possible new bleeding and
risk for hypotension, monitored closely. Normotensive with
regular rate in the hospital, and did not restart these
medicines in the hospital or on discharge.
.
## Mechanical heart valve: Was on heparin bridge while off
coumadin in preparation for procedure, and until therapeutic
after EGD/[**Last Name (un) **]. This latter heparin to coumadin bridge took
considerable time and was the main reason for the length of her
admission. She was discharged with an INR of 2.6.
.
#FEN: Heart healthy diet after [**Last Name (un) 12964**].
.
#PPx:
Heparin/coumadin, as above; PPI, as above.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
GI bleed secondary to supratherapeutic INR and antral erosions.


Discharge Condition:
Good


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having
bleeding in your gastrointestinal system. The doctors performed
two [**Name5 (PTitle) 12964**]; one looked inside your large intestine, and the
other looked inside your stomach. The study that looked inside
your stomach showed that there were some spots in your stomach
lining that had eroded away, and were bleeding.
.
You have been taking coumadin (also called warfarin), a
blood-thinning medicine that is important for you because you
have mechanical heart valves. Coumadin helps to prevent strokes
in people with these heart valves. But coumadin can also make it
easier to bleed. It is likely that with too high a coumadin
level, the erosions in your stomach bled more than they would
have otherwise.
.
You should continue to take the coumadin, and to get your blood
checked regularly. Your doctor or nurse may need to change the
dosage in order to make sure the coumadin level is correct.
.
Sometimes leafy green vegetables can lower your coumadin level.
If eating leafy green vegetables is important in your diet, talk
to your doctor about trying to find ways that you can eat your
vegetables and have a stable coumadin level. For now, avoid
leafy green vegetables like kale and collard greens until you
can discuss this with your doctor.

Followup Instructions:
Make an appointment with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] as soon as possible-- they
need to check your blood levels of Coumadin, the blood thinner.
Make an appointment with the gastrointestinal clinic for one
month from now.

CXR [**12-3**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post endotracheal
tube placement with the tip lying 3.0 cm above the level of the
carina. There are right base atelectatic changes. There are low
lung volumes. The lungs are clear with no evidence of pneumonia
or congestive heart failure. There is no evidence of pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours
are normal in appearance. The visualized osseous structures are
unremarkable. There are high-density ovoid structures projecting
over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen that could either
represent gallstones or may be extrinsic to the patient. Please
correlate clinically. IMPRESSION: 1. ET tube 3 cm above the
level of the carina. 2. Possible calcified gallstones.
.
CXR ([**2128-12-4**]): Tubes and lines in good position. Nasogastric
tube coils in the stomach. Atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented with lip and tongue swelling consistent
with angioedema in setting of ACEi use. She was intubated for
airway protection in the ED. Upon admission to the ICU, the
patient was started on pulse dose steroids, antihistamines and
H2 blockers around the clock. Her swelling rapidly improved and
she was successfully extubated within 48 hours. She was
evaluated by the allergy consult service who recommended C4 and
C1 esterase inhibitor levels which are pending at the time of
discharge. The patient was discharged on an oral prednisone
taper. She was transitioned off of her home ACEi in favor of
amlodipine for blood pressure control. She was also [**Month/Day/Year 1988**]
for outpatient allergy follow-up. The patient should avoid all
ACEi and [**Last Name (un) **] use in the future.

The patient was incidentally noted to have hilar lymphadenopathy
on CXR. Outpatient CT is recommended for further evaluation of
this finding.

She continues on albuertol for astham and oral contraceptives
for chronic uterine bleeding.

Blood smear [**6-13**]:
Numerous large monomorphic cells with very high N:C ratio,
minimal cytoplasm, multiple nucleoli, rare granules and no clear
auer rods.  Rare platelets, normal appearing RBC with occasional
nucleated RBC.

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING [**2200-6-14**]
INTERPRETATION
Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia. Peripheral blood morphological
review shows high white counts, blasts with high N:C ratio,
irregular nuclear contours, very sparse granules. No Auer rods
seen. Given the absence of HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] CD34, while the morphology
does not support it, the flow profile does not rule out acute
promyelocytic leukemia. Correlation with cytogenetics and FISH
is recommended.

Cytogenetics Report [**2200-6-15**]
Culture of this specimen yielded no metaphase cells;
therefore, chromosome analysis could not be performed

FISH analysis with probes to the PML and RARA loci was
interpreted as NORMAL.

Imaging

Echo (pre-chemo) [**2200-6-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and
global/regional systolic function.

IMPRESSION:  No deep venous thrombosis in the right or left
lower extremity

TTE (Congenital, focused views) [**2200-6-20**]
This focused study demonstrates a patent foramen ovale with
small amount of right-to-left interatrial flow at rest.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2200-6-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Findings most consistent with typhlitis/neutropenic colitis,
given
patient's history.
2.  7 x 12 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule; given
substantial size,
follow-up CT is recommended within three months to show
resolution.  A small
nearby nodule can also be reassessed at that time.  Infectious
etiologies
could be considered or the nodule may incidental, though
substantial in size;
it would be an unlikely presentation of leukemia.  Right middle
lobe
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] process may represent early infection/inflammation.
3.  Small hypodensities bilateral renal cortices, too small to
characterize
fully.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2200-7-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Persistent cecitis and ascending colitis with persistent and
perhaps
slightly increased wall thickening and also greater inflammatory
fat
stranding.  The appearance suggests neutropenic colitis given
the patient's
history.

2.  Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, increased in the short
one-week interval since the prior study, worrisome for an
ongoing infectious etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F presenting with 2 weeks of increasing fatigue, mild
dyspnea, and recent low grade fever and dental abscess.  Given
lab findings, with elevated WBC count to 257K with 98% blasts,
found to have likely acute myelomonocytic leukemia, course of
7+3 chemotherapy complicated by stroke, typhlitis, neutropenic
fever, and likely fungal lung infection.

# Acute leukemia: Healthy 75F with 2-3 weeks of fatigue and
recent possible dental abscess s/p extraction [**6-5**] who presented
with elevated WBC >200K and anemia/thrombocytopenia discovered
at her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**6-13**]. She was admitted to the ICU for emergent
pheresis. In the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] IJ central line catheter was placed
for pheresis given her WBC of 257 and risk for leukostasis.
After pheresis, her WBC count dropped to 127. She was also
started on hydroxyurea, allopurinol, and emperic cefepime for
chemo. After some discussions with the family she agreed to
chemotherapy and was transfered to BMT service for further
management. She underwent 7+3 cytarabine & idarubicin, course
was complicated by ischemic CVA on [**6-18**] found to have PFO & no
obvious source of thrombus, neutropenic colitis ([**2198-6-23**]),
likely fungal lung infection and neutropenic fever as discussed
below. After coming out of her nadir, patient had leukocytosis
to 20-30k, peripheral smear and flow showed mature monocytes,
possibly consistent with myelodysplasia or robust recovery, less
likely recurrence of leukemia or infection. Bone marrow biopsy
was not done for evidence of remission as patient does not wish
to have further chemotherapy, regardless of potential result.
-Patient will continue to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] in clinic

#Sepsis/Febrile neutropenia:  Pt had low grade fevers on [**6-30**],
and fever to 101.7 @430 [**7-1**], afebrile at the time of transfer
[**7-2**]. Pt on broad spectrum abx coverage with [**Last Name (un) 2830**]/vanco. CT
chest/abd found new nodule in LLL that was increasing in size
suggesting infectious process. Sinus CT found possible
involvement of the right maxillary sinus.  ENT was consulted and
swab culture of the sinus was unrevealing.  Before being
transferred to the ICU for the second time during this
admission, she also developed hypotension with SBP in 80s after
receving ambisome.  She responded to fluid boluses and did not
require pressor support. At time, the hypotension was consider
to be mult-factorial including side-effect of ambisome as well
as underlying infection.  Cultures were negative. Pt was
continued on broad spectrum abx coverage. A CT chest/abd ([**7-1**])
found enlarging nodule in LLL, and sinus CT found possible
involvement of the right maxillary sinus with oral-antral
fistula. ID consult also followed patient during this admission.
- Per oral maxillofacial surgery there is no evidence of a
current dental abcess or dental infection
- All antibiotics except voriconazole were stopped and patient
was stable for two days prior to discharge.

# Syncope:  Syncopal episode [**2200-6-23**] likely secondary to
vasovagal or orthostatic hypotension.Pt had difficult ambulating
and required more assistance than normal. Now ambulating better
since starting PT.
-PT and OT therapy to continue since pt is still functioning
below baseline. Pt will continue to benefit from acute PT.

# Ischemic CVA - pt w/ new isolated L-sided mouth droop since
[**6-18**], neurology was consulted, MRI showed subtle area of ischemia
in centrum stemi ovale, extending into right insula (vascular
territory of R MCA), echo w/ bubble showed PFO, doppler of
bilateral LEs negative.
-Blood pressure control
-ASA 162mg daily started prior to discharge

#Rash: Patient had new erythematous non-pruritic maculopapular,
blanching rash on the back from the nape of neck to the T8-T9
dermatome. Concern was for leukemia cutis or fungal or drug
rash. Dermatology was consulted and believed the rash was
dependent erythema with early miliaria from recent fevers,
biopsy showed likely drug hypersensitivity reaction. Rash
resolved with removal of meropenem from regimen.

# Typhlitis/Neutropenic colitis: Pt found to have significant
bowel wall thickening and edema from cecum to hepatic flexture
consistent with typhlitis/ neutropenic colitis on [**2200-6-24**]. Pt
did not have abdominal pain but has reported some loose stools.
Broad spectrum coverage with aztreonam and flagyl until [**2200-7-14**],
was stable of antibiotic until discharge, ID followed. C. diff
was negative.

# Pulmonary nodule: [**Month (only) 116**] represent infection vs inflammation.
- Pt on aztrenonam, flagyl, vanco, ambisome
- concern since nodule size has increased in size over 1 week
period
- pt will need follow up CT in 3 months to f/u on nodule
- pt will follow in outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic, to determine length of
voriconazole treatment

Transitional Issues:
- pt will need follow up CT in 3 months to f/u on nodule
- goals of care: patient does not want more chemotherapy if she
has a recurrence

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 14664**],

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].  You came to the hospital because you
were tired, not feeling well and you were found to have a high
white blood cell count by your primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] were
found to have acute myelogenous leukemia so you underwent
induction chemotherapy with (7+3) [**Doctor First Name **] + cytarabine. You
tolerated the chemotherapy well and your blood counts dropped as
expected.  You also experienced a stroke which resulted in a
left facial droop and left arm weakness.  A work-up for the
cause of the stroke revealed that you have a patent foramen
ovale, which is a hole between two [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of your heart. In
addition you also developed neutropenic colitis which means that
the wall of your large intestines was inflammed which is a
complication of receiving chemotherpy.  We put you on
appropriate antibiotics to prevent an infection, rested your
bowels, and provide you nutrition via an IV line.  In addition
you also developed a rash which was a side effect of the
antibioitics you were taking. Your nutritional status improved
as did the infection in your bowels by the time you were
discharged.

The following changes were made to your medications:
START voriconazole for your fungal infection
START acyclovir to prevent viral infections
START two baby aspirin a day for your stroke
START metoprolol for your high blood pressure

Please keep your appointments as scheduled below.

Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Presyncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old male who
presented with a one-week history of fatigue,
lightheadedness, and black tarry stools with occasional
bright red blood per rectum.  The patient is status post a
bicycle accident in the summer of [**2166**] and has been taking
ibuprofen 400 mg q. 4-6 hours for approximately one month.
He also reports band-like chest pain radiating from his back
consistent with his history of chronic back pain.  He also
has increased chest pain with deep breaths and with movement
but denies shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or
significant diaphoresis.  Other review of systems is
noncontributory.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Status post bicycle accident in
summer [**2166**] resulting in chronic lower back pain and history
of herniated disk.  2. Hyperplastic polyp on colonoscopy
[**11-7**].  3. History of rheumatic fever.  4. Obstructive sleep
apnea.  5. Childhood polio.  6. Status post tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Neurontin (patient
self-discontinued secondary to sedative side effects).  2.
Ibuprofen 400 mg q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.  3. Prozac 20 mg p.o.
q.d.  4. Flonase.  5. Omega oils.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and is a former
executive.  He denies the use of tobacco.  He occasionally
drinks alcohol.  He does not use drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has a history of coronary artery
disease and Addison's disease.  Father has a history of
valvular heart disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98, pulse 82, blood
pressure 105/66, respiratory rate 18 and 100% on room air.
The patient was a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished
male in no acute distress.  His HEENT examination was normal
except for dry mucous membranes.  His neck was supple with 7
cm of jugular venous pressure.  His chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  He had a regular rate and rhythm
with a systolic murmur.  His abdomen was soft and
nondistended with mild epigastric tenderness and normal
active bowel sounds.  The patient had black stools that were
guaiac positive.  His extremities showed no pedal edema.
Pulses were +2 bilaterally.  Neurological examination was
grossly intact.  The patient was alert and oriented x 3.

Nasogastric lavage was deferred as EGD was to be done.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit was 24.3.  The remainder of the
patient's complete blood count, chem-10 and basic coagulation
studies were within normal limits.

EKG:  On admission the patient was in normal sinus rhythm
with a rate of 76, normal axis and intervals and no ischemic
changes.

Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or interstitial edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Upper GI bleed:  EGD performed on
[**2168-4-18**] revealed a normal EGD to the second part of the
duodenum.  In the second part of the duodenum a fresh clot
located between the duodenal bulb and the ampulla was noted.
After washings there was fresh bleeding that completely
obscured visualization.  Despite multiple attempts of
washings, therapeutic cautery was impossible with EGD.  Given
the brisk bleeding, an emergent artery embolization was
needed.  Interventional radiology performed an embolization
of the gastroduodenal artery and noted a pseudoaneurysm at
the entrance into the duodenum.  This was performed on
[**2168-4-18**].  The patient's hematocrit reached a nadir of 13.9
on [**2168-4-18**] and required six units of packed red blood cells
for resuscitation.  Following the embolization described
above the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit
remained stable at approximately 28.  The patient's diet was
advanced slowly 48 hours following the procedure without
complications.  Serial examinations were performed to
evaluate for ischemic colitis which revealed a completely
benign abdomen.

Gastroenterology followed the patient during the course of
admission and made several recommendations to decrease future
risks of GI bleeding, including Protonix b.i.d. for at least
two weeks and then continued q.d. thereafter, avoidance of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Omega oils,
avoidance of alcohol and avoidance of coffee.

Prior to discharge, a repeat endoscopy was done to reevaluate
the region of active bleeding.  This was performed on
[**2168-4-21**] and revealed a shallow ulcer in the second part of
the duodenum.  Per gastroenterology, this region is stable
and the patient does not require further follow up from their
department unless there are signs of recurrent bleeding, such
as presyncope, bloody stools, melena, or hemodynamically
instability.  Helicobacter pylori was negative.

2. Chest pain:  The patient had the band-like chest pain on
presentation that was typical of his chronic pain.  The
patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.  He had a
normal EKG.  Pain resolved with treatment of upper GI bleed
and with Ultram.

3. Back pain:  The patient was initiated on a treatment plan
with Ultram as an alternative to ibuprofen for chronic back
pain.  The patient states that he gained adequate relief with
this regimen and did not find any significant side effects in
the first few days to use.  He will be discharged with a
prescription for Ultram.  Tylenol may also be used.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Upper GI bleed.
2. Anemia secondary to blood loss status post six units of
packed red blood cells.
3. Melena.
4. Chest pain, not otherwise specified.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 216**], in one week.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Tramadol 50 mg p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
3. Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.

PENDING STUDIES:  None.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is stable
hemodynamically.  His hematocrit is approximately 28.  He is
tolerating a regular diet.  He has no gross blood or melena
in the stool.  He has no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 y/o M with a history of [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome who is
nonverbal at baseline who presents with fever and associated
vomiting for 1 day and a leukocytosis, with exam, oxygen
requirement, and imaging consistent with health-care associated
pneumonia.

1. Pneumonia: Patient presented with fever to 101 and
leukocytosis with a CXR consistent with left base consolidation
and a new supplemental O2 requirement. Was found to be
hypotensive in the ED, although volume responsive and was
normotensive on arrival to the MICU. Although a nursing home
resident, he was initially covered in the ED with vanco,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and he defervesced overnight and
so was continued on this regimen at the time of transfer to the
regular floors. Blood cultures drawn in the ED prior to
antibiotics were negative. On the floor, pt had fever to 100.8
and was broadened to vancomcyin, zosyn and azithromycin. He lost
IV access and was briefly transitioned to PO regimen with
linezolid, flagyl, and levofloxacin.  He did well for >36 hours
with no fever or leukocytosis on this oral regimen so decision
was made to contiune treatment on oral antibiotics to be
completed at home.  Repeat CXR in [**2-13**] weeks recommended to
ensure complete resolution.

2.  [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome: At best pt has [**4-17**] sz/wk and can
often have daily seizures. Was continued on home anti-epileptic
regimen including phenytoin, keppra, and felbatol. Dilantin
levels were measured and were therapeutic. Pt did not have any
seizures during hospitalization.

3. Anemia: baseline of 30-33. Hct at baseline during admission.
He has a history of chronic GI bleeds, had several guaiac
positive stools during admission, however Hct stable throughout
hospitalization. On ferrous sulfate TID usually, but was changed
to daily considering h/o constipation.

4. Dysphagia: Continued a ground diet with thickened liquids and
pills crushed in ice cream or applesauce, at the time of
discharge he was tolerating his diet well

5. Diarrhea: pt with several loose stools during admission, C
diff negative x 3.  Resolved at time of discharge.

History of Present Illness:
 82yo F with h/o renal artery stenosis, CKD stage III, pAF on
coumadin presents with BRBPR X 3 yesterday. Patient presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] about 1 month ago with increased creatinine to 3 (from
1.6). A workup including renal biopsy revealed pauci-immune
P-ANCA positive glomerulonephritis thought secondary to
hydralazine. She was started on prednisone and cyclophosphamide
at that point.
In addition, according to the patient and records from [**Hospital **] she was also recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] after a
collapse one month ago. She was brought in and found to have AF
with RVR. Was started on dilt and metoprolol with reportedly
good control. Further workup there included an EGD and
colonoscopy which revealed gastric ulcers and polyps as well as
candidiasis. She received 2units pRBCs and her hct came up to
30. While there she was noted to be neutropenic. They thought
this was possibly medication related. Cyclophosphamide, bactrim,
and fluconazole were discontinued. She completed a course of
caspofungin and a TTE was negative for vegetations. Her WBC
count came up. She was discharged to [**Hospital3 **].
Today was feeling weak and tired and then had 3 episodes of
BRBPR so decided to come to Ed. Presented to ED in AF with RVR
to 160s. Received 10mg Iv Dilt with improvement in rate to high
90s/100. Received then 30mg PO dilt. Stable HRs since. Also
received 5mg IV metoprolol.
Initial VS: 97.8 137AF 111/78 16 99. No N/V/Abd pain. Just feels
tired. Rectal exam revealed guaiac positive dark stool. Received
IVF and 40mg IV protonix. Hct in ED is 27 consistent with
baseline (25-30) here at [**Hospital1 18**]. Were going to do NGL but decided
not to because didn't want her to go back into AF with RVR. GI
called in Ed and will see her on the floor.
.
On the floor, patient complained of being sick of being in the
hospital and dry mouth. Otherwise densies fevers, chills,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
Has had some weight loss worked up in the past and possibly
related to depression (per the patient) after her friend died
recently. Complained of occasional flank pain at biopsy site and
a developing bed sore. Rest of ROS negative including no CP,
palps, sob, dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
82yo F with h/o PUD and CKD with recent acute renal failure from
hydralazine induced pauci-immune glomerulonephritis admitted
with BRBPR and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
.
# GIB: Given significant orthostasis, hct down to 24 (baseline
30) and history of PUD, initially concerned about UGIB.  NG
lavage was negative which was reassuring.  She was given 2u pRBC
with stable blood counts and hemodynamics.  She had an EGD on
[**4-13**] without e/o active bleeding.  Per GI likely LGIB and will
need c-scope sometime during this admission.  She was also given
2u FFP given coagulopathy and concern for GIB and need for
endoscopy. Bleeding ceased, however, colonoscopy deferred
secondary to difficult to control AFib with RVR. She should
follow-up as an outpatient for colonscopy.
.
# AF with RVR: She had been on sotolol for several years until
her recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] when this was discontinued in the
setting of her worsening renal failure.  She was noted to have
AF with RVR to 140s.  Initially felt to be worsened by volume
depletion with GIB.  However, despite blood products, she
remained tachycardic and thus nodal agents were resumed.
Anticoagulation was held in acute setting, with coagulopathy
reversed in the setting of GIB. She was uptitrated on her PO
regimen to Metoprolol 50mg TID and Diltiazem 30mg QID which kept
her HR in reasonable control until she underwent a bowel prep
for her colonoscopy. On the morning of the scheduled
colonoscopy, she developed AFib with RVR in the setting of
dehydration evidence by alkalosis and hypernatremia. She
received agressive IV hydration and multiple IV medications to
help control rate. Her heart rate initially responded and
stabilized in the 90-100's. However, the following evening, she
required another bowel prep and her heart rate escalated to the
150's. She received additional IV nodal agents and her PO
regimen was increased. An electrophysiology consult was obtained
and the recommendation was for rate control and uptitration with
her current medications. Rhythm control was deferred. She was
restarted on anti-coagulation on HD#5 with a heparin gtt. A TEE
showed no evidence of thrombus. A cardioversion was attempted
and was unsuccessful. The patient was loaded with amiodarone and
the Metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] to achieve adequate
rate control. She was started on Diltiazem which was uptitrated
to 45mg PO QID.  HR was in the 80s on discharge.  Her coumadin
was re-started and heparin gtt was continued until the INR was
therapeutic.  Her INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was
held on discharge.  She should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.  She should have INR checked in 2 days and coumadin
restarted.  If her Amiodarone converts her to sinus rhythm or
drops her heart rate as she becomes therapeutic, she may need to
stop her Metoprolol.
.
# CHF: In the setting of Atrial Fibrillation with RVR, the
patient was noted to develop signs and symptoms concerning for
CHF, such as rales and O2 requirement. The patient was diuresed
adequately with Lasix and symptoms improved. The patient was
weaned off supplemental oxygen and was staturating 95% on RA.
Her creatinine bumped and Lasix was stopped.  Her peak
creatinine was 2.8 on [**2182-4-21**] and came down to 2.5 on [**2182-4-23**].
Lasix can be considered as an outpatient if she develops signs
and symptoms of congestive heart failure.
.
# CKD: Renal function improving.  Per renal, taper prednsione to
40 mg and then to 30mg. She remained on prednisone 3omg Daily
and her creatinine remained stable.  Her steroid ppx including
PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], PPI, calcium, vit D were continued.  She was followed
by the renal consult service during her admission and Lasix was
held when Creatinine was elevated.  She is on Atovaquone
Suspension 1500 mg PO/NG DAILY for prophylaxis.
.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for bleeding from your rectum.
You received a blood transfusion for anemia. You blood count
improved and your bleeding stopped.

The gatroenterologists performed an upper endoscopy which was
normal. You were continued on a antacid. The plan was for you to
undergo a colonoscopy.

While undergoing the prep for the colonoscopy, you developed a
very fast heart rate from your atrial fibrillation. Your blood
pressure medications were increased to help control our heart
rate. The cardiologists attempted to cardiovert you out of
atrial fibrillation, but were unsuccessful. You were started on
Amiodarone and continued on metoprolol.  You were started on
Diltiazem for heart rate control. You were given lasix for heart
failure but this was stopped prior to discharge.

When you came into the hospital, you were taking prednisone. The
nephrologists recommended that your prednisone be decreased to
30mg per day. You should continue to take Prednisone 30mg Daily.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, HCC and alcoholic
cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status requiring
intubation for airway protection in the setting of suspected
opioid overdose.

Encephalopathy - The etiology of the patient's AMS was likely
multifactorial involving end stage liver disease,?anoxic-insult
given unknown down time, and opiate toxicity. Head CT negative
at OSH.  Upon admission, the patient was sedated and intubated.
Pt began regimen of lactulose with >4BMs per day; with a
decrease in NH4 from 140-->38 during his MICU stay. The
patient's mentation improved during his admission, sedating
medications were weaned down before extubation, and upon
transfer out of MICU he was A&O to person and place and
following commands.  Pt. was on CIWA on transfer to floor and
gradually cleared w/ less and less lorazepam. AT time of D/C he
was A/Ox3 for several days.

Respiratory failure/PNA ?????? Pt was intubated for unresponsiveness
and a GCS of 8 at an OSH. CT of chest demonstrated RLL
consolidation c/w possible aspiration PNA.  Upon admission to
the MICU, the patient was still intubated and sedated with
propofol. Empiric zosyn was started for coverage of aspiration
PNA which was changed to Unasyn on [**10-11**]. Repeat CXR on [**10-12**]
showed improving lung fields with no signs of consolidation.
Sputum GS grew GPCs in pairs, chains, and clusters on [**10-12**]. The
pateitn was weaned off sedation on [**10-11**], extubated, and placed
on 2LNC O2 with adequate oxygen saturation. Upon transfer, the
patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint. On the floor he
did not have any pulmonary distress, but did spike a fever to
102.5 while on unasyn, so he was switched to vanc/levo/zosyn.
His CXR was negative and he quickly defervesced so Abx were
stopped after a short course.

EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC ?????? Per recent history, the patient has a
h/o EtOH abuse, his HCC is rapidly progressing and his liver
function is rapidly declining. Upon admission, he had many
stigmata of liver disease, both on exam (encephalopathic,
scleral icterus, palpable mass in epigastric area c/w HCC mass
in left lobe, mild ascites, spider angioma, extensive
ecchymosis) and laboratory testing (elevated INR and abnormal
liver enzymes). Pt was given vit Kx1 without change in his INR.
The liver team was consulted and followed the patient during his
stay. An U/S of RUQ on [**10-12**] showed no signs of portal vein
thrombosis, cirrhosis and large infiltrative mass in the left
lobe of the liver c/w patient's known hepatocellular carcinoma;
there is probable new tumor ingrowth into the left portal vein
which is non-occlusive. Pt. was offered hospice house but could
not wait until this was available, he decided to leave AMA.

Hx of heavy EtOH abuse - The patient was maintained on CIWA
scale with 1mg of ativan per protocol in the MICU. The ativan
was weaned to 0.5mg on [**10-12**] and completely off two days later.
Pt. stated that he would continue to drink on d/c.

Hypotension: On [**10-11**], the patient developed hypotension to
80/40's. Likely secondary to physiology of hepatic failure and
possibly opioid toxicity. Given IVF boluses and bolus of albumin
with good response. Home BP medications were held. Pt remained
hemodynamically stable afterwards.

Guaiac + NGT aspirate - pt with history varices and significant
variceal bleeding, also EtOH abuse. Hct stable in mid-20's
during admission and hemodynamics not c/w acute bleed. The
patient was Type and Screened, adequate peripheral access was
achieved and he was placed on a PPI and Hct remained stable for
the duration of admission.

YOU ARE LEAVING AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.
You have been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and
hepatocellular carcinoma. You will need to take your lactulose
and Rifaximin exactly as prescribed so that you do not become
confused again. We stopped your clonidine and nadolol because
your blood pressure was low. We started you on a calcium
supplement because your nutrition was poor. We increased your
spironolactone to 200mg daily and your lasix (furosemide) to
80mg daily because your legs were swelling with fluid. We did
not change any of your other medications. We started you on
rifaximin to help stop you from getting confused.

Please take all of your medications exactly as prescribed.

If you have any confusion, fevers, chills, nightsweats, chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, bleeding, black tarry
stools, vomiting blood or any other concerning symptoms call

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
male with known ST elevation, MI, status post elective cath
complicated by hypotension and bradycardia who was
transferred to CCU for observation.  The patient initially
presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center on [**2163-1-14**] with
chest pain radiating to the jaw.  He was found to have
increased troponin of 1.76, was given Nitroglycerin and
remained pain free over the next three days at the outside
hospital on Aspirin, Plavix and Nitroglycerin prn.  He was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
elective catheterization on [**2163-1-17**].  The catheterization
showed double occlusion of PDA, no intervention was done.
The patient was transferred to post-op area where he became
hypotensive after continuous pressure to his groin was
applied in order to stop the bleeding from the femoral
artery.  The patient was noticed to have groin hematoma and
angiocele was attempted.  He was also given 40 mg of
Protamine in order to stop the bleeding.  At this time he
became hypotensive.  This was thought to be secondary to
vagal reflux.  He was given IV fluids and Dopamine after
which he developed upper body pruritic rash.  Because of the
concern for anaphylaxis secondary to dye Protamine, the
patient was given 120 mg of Solu-Medrol and Benadryl as well
as Promethazine and Pepcid.  CT of the head and abdomen were
obtained in order to rule out retroperitoneal or head
bleeding.  Both were negative.  Vascular surgery was
consulted and the patient was transferred to the CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for lung cancer.  The
patient had left lung cancer in [**2147**] and right lung cancer in
[**2155**], both resected.  He also had a brain metastasis thought
to be due to left lung cancer in [**2149**], prostatic cancer
diagnosed in [**2160**].  Also has a history of hypertension,
peripheral vascular disease and hypercholesterolemia.

Chief Complaint:
hypoxia and confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77 y/o M with h/o CHF (EF= 40-45% on ECHO [**4-/2104**]), atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as transfer from
[**Hospital6 5016**] in [**Location (un) 7661**], MA for further management of
hypoxia due to left upper lobe pneumonia and and ongoing
delirium due to previous aspiration pneumonia (right middle
lobe). The patient's current history starts [**2104-7-15**], when he was
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] (requiring a brief ICU stay) for left
upper lobe pneumonia, treated with levofloxacin X7 day course.
He was discharged home with [**Hospital1 269**], but around [**7-25**] he started
having hypoxia (resting O2sat of 95%, ambulatory O2sat of 85%),
and also had cloudy urine. He was treated with Ciprofloxacin
X2-3 days for UTI, but because his hypoxia persisted and he had
progressively worse dyspnea, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-27**]. A
new right middle lobe infiltrate was noted on CXR during that
admission, which was felt to be an aspiration pneumonia. Patient
was evaluated by Speech and Swallow who felt he had silent
aspirations. He was treated with an 8 day course of broad
antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) which ended on [**2104-8-4**]. He
was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on the 20th, but on the 21st
he was sent to the [**Hospital6 5016**] because his O2 sats were
down in the 80s. At the OSH, a CT chest was performed that
showed bilateral pulmonary fibrosis with brochiectasic changes
and a small acute infiltrate in the left upper lobe. Patient
received 4 days of levofloxacin IV. On the 24th, the patient and
his family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
his treatment because this is where he gets the majority of his
treatment.
.
Of note, the CTA chest from [**7-15**] states: ""Extensive
consolidation involving the left upper lobe, could represent
infection. However, given the clinical history of elevated INR,
hemoptysis, and lack of symptoms of pneumonia, this could
represent pulmonary hemorrhage.""
.
Also, since the patient's discharge from first admission, on
[**7-20**] there has been concerns regarding ongoing altered
mental status. For a while, the patient's wife had to have
friends take turns supervising him at home when she was out.
Geriatrics was involved during the patient's last [**Hospital1 18**]
admission for difficult to manage delirium which was felt
somewhat more consistent with that of acute brain injury.
Psychiatry at [**Hospital6 5016**] saw the patient during his
current admission and felt he was delirious from ongoing
hypoxia, and pulmonary disease. Prior to his presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-15**], the patient had been functional and travelling
through [**Country 18084**] where he climbed up to Edinburgh Castle.
.
Upon transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was stable. When
interviewed, however, he was alert and oriented X2 but not
making much sense in his answers. When asked about his symptoms,
he would talk about his coming from [**Location (un) **] many years ago. He
did endorse trouble breathing and anxiety. The RN noted he
coughed up mucous with blood.
.
Review of systems:
Difficult to get an accurate ROS as patient's responses do not
make sense.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old man with CAD, CHF, who was admitted
with hypoxia and AMS. Respiratory failure worsened during his
hospital course despite treatments. He was made CMO and
terminally extubated on [**2104-8-27**]. The patient died at 7:03pm.
.
.
# HYPOXIA/DYSPNEA: The patient was transfered from OSH with
hypoxia and dyspnea. We began treatment of LUL pneumonia
empirically with levofloxacin (for CAP coverage), vancomycin
(HAP coverage), and cefepime (for pseudomonal coverage). On the
second day of hospitalization, levofloxacin was stopped and he
was continued on vanc/cef for total of a 14 day course.  Due to
the fact that his pneumonia was not improving since his original
diagnosis [**2104-7-15**], pulmonology was consulted. Urine legionella
was negative, LDH was elevated at 392.  A CT of the Chest on
[**8-9**] showed marked worsening of nonspecific multifocal
ground-glass opacities and consolidations predominantly
involving the left upper, right upper, left lower and portions
of the right lower lobes of infectious v. inflammatory v.
hemorrhagic etiology.  Bronchoscopy on [**8-14**] was grossly normal,
no signs of hemorrhage (only abnormality small nonobstructing
membrane extending about one-third of the way into the airway
lumen in the posterior segment of the left upper lobe).  BAL
showed hemosiderin-laden macrophages and multinucleated
histiocytes and was negative for malignant cells, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 18092**], and CMV, and was significant only for 1+ PMNs and
10-100K yeast, most likely colonizer).  Blood cultures were
negative x 5, HIV was negative, aspergillus negative, hepatitis
serologies were negative.  Infectious w/u was significant only
for a positive serum beta glucan (163), and at time of transfer
to the MICU cryptococcus and quantiferon gold were pending.
Inflammatory w/u negative for anti-GBM negative, complement
normal, ANCA negative, ESR elevated at 60.   He completed a 14
day course of vanc/cef without improvement in pulmonary status.
Repeat chest CT on [**8-17**] showed interval progression of
multifocal consolidations, likely representing infections,
although inflammatory condition is a possibility as well as new
small bilateral pleural effusions. He was again started on 40 mg
IV lasix daily with appropriate diuresis.  Infectious disease
was consulted on [**8-21**] and recommended VATS for definitive
diagnosis as it was not felt that the underlying pulmonary
process represented an infectious etiology, however he was not
deemed to be a surgical candidate due to his many comorbidities.
 Per chest CT, there was concern that the ground glass opacities
on repeat chest CT may represent usual interstitial pneumonitis,
the treatment of which would be steroids.  On [**8-21**] he was
started on empiric IV solumedrol 80 mg TID which was tapered to
80 mg IV BID on [**8-23**].  Repeat CXR on [**8-24**] showed no significant
change from prior and plans were for steroid taper.

Throughout hospital stay, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was on supplementary O2 as
needed, incentive spirometry, and albuterol/ipratropium nebs. O2
was weaned and sats were consistently in the low 90s on room air
and in the mid-high 90s on 2L O2 NC.
.
# DELIRIUM: Patient came in with delirium, which he did not have
at baseline (was travelling in [**Country 18084**], hiking with family in
[**Month (only) 216**]). The likely etiology of his delirium was considered his
ongoing infection +/- hospitalizations. UA was performed and was
negative, a UCx showed no growth, which ruled out UTI as the
cause of delirium. A CT head at last admission was negative for
any intracranial process and repeat head CT on [**8-19**], obtained
after an unwitnessed fall from bed with no signs of trauma again
showed no acute intracranial process, again showed small vessel
ischemic disease, unchanged old lacunar infarcts in the
bilateral basal ganglia and extreme capsule, and prominent
ventricles and sulci. On admission he was initially given
Olanzapine 5mg po q6h PRN agitation and haldol.  Geriatrics
follwoed the patient for management of his persistent delerium
and sundowning and per their recommendations olanzapine was
swithced to seroquel and uptitrated to 12.5 QAM and 37.5 QHS
with PRN seroquel and haldol.  Delerium was also managed with
soft restraints and cage bed in order to keep Mr. [**Known lastname **] from
injuring staff and pulling out his lines.

Neurology was consulted on admission and initially felt his
confusion was due to his underlying pulmonary process.  However,
when he failed to improve despite antibiotics and no source of
infection was identified, they were reconsulted on [**8-21**] and
recommended LP, MRI w/ and w/o contrast, and EEG due to concern
for limibic encephalitis vs. paraneoplastic process vs. temporal
lobe epilepsy.  Patient is not a candidate for MRI due to his
Zenith AAA stent graft.  At the time of transfer LP had so far
shown normal glucose, protein, and WBC, no organisms on Gram
stain, no growth on preliminary bacterial, fungal, and acid fast
cultures, negative cryptococcal antigen.  CSF HSV and VDRL
pending at time of transfer.  Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibodies were negative.
Serum RPR and [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] antibody panel, and 1,25 vitamin D
were pending.  Patient was also undergoing EEG monitoring at the
time of transfer.
.
# CHF: The patient has a history of CHF (EF 40-45% per TTE done
in [**4-/2104**]) and his CXR has presence of some mild pulmonary
edema.  He was initially continued on his home Lasix 40 mg po qd
for CHF management, and medical management was continued with
continued Carvedilol and Losartan.  His lasix was discontinued
for several days due to worsening delerium and no IV access and
NPO status.  Repeat chest CT on It was restarted intermittently
at 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].  On [**8-19**] a loud MR murmur was noted on physical
exam and repeat TTE was poor quality and showed EF of 30-35%,
question of worsening MR, and antero/anterolateral hypokinesis.

.
# CAD with h/o MI: Isosorbide Mononitrate ER 30mg daily and ASA
were held the day after admission for systolic blood pressures
in the low 100s, some bloody sputum and supratherapeutic INR
(3.8 on admission).  He was a poor historian and intermittently
[**Month/Day (1) 12861**] substernal chest pain.  EKGs demonstrated TWI in the
anterior, anterolateral, and inferolateral leads.  Troponins
were elevated at 0.07 to 0.1 with normal CK-MB and cardiology
was consulted and felt this was most likely demand ischemia so
he continued on medical management, Asa was restarted, and he
was placed on carvedilol and [**Last Name (un) **] ([**Last Name (un) **] until [**8-18**] when his Cr
bumped.)  On the morning of transfer, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12861**] [**4-24**]
substernal chest pressure, as he had intermittently reported
throughout hospitalization and cardiac enzymes were again
checked and showed troponin 0.02 (down from prior) and ECG
showed no significant change from baseline.
.
# AFIB: Patient was rate controlled on admission and remained
irregularly irregular throughout his hospital course. Patient
had an elevated INR (3.8) on admission with no evidence of acute
bleed, so coumadin was held but rate control was continued with
carvedilol.  His carvedilol dose was stopped and restarted after
he developed an episode of A.fib with RVR on [**8-13**].  INR trended
down and coumadin was again started on [**8-14**] at a low dose of 2
mg daily.  It was deemed to be safely stopped on [**8-16**] in
preparation for G-J tube placement in IR, as the patient had no
reported history of stroke, and patient was given one dose of 1
mg of IV vitamin K on [**9-1**] and [**8-22**] (3 mg total).
Warfarin has been held since [**8-18**].
.
# HTN: Pt has a history of HTN. We continued home Losartan 100
mg Tablet until [**8-18**] when Cr bumped.
.
# FEN: During previous hospitalizations, patient was evaluated
by speech and swallow who thought he might be having silent
aspiration and recommended soft diet and nectar thick fluids
with monitoring when taking in by mouth food and medications. We
continued soft diet and nectar thick fluid with aspiration
precautions.  Video swallow on [**8-11**] showed aspiration of all
consistencies and he was made NPO.  Repeat video swallow on [**8-15**]
again showed florid aspiration.  On [**8-21**] he was allowed to take
sips and eat a dysphagia diet because he had been NPO for 10
days, had poor IV access, and had not tolerated multiple
attempts at dobhoff placement on the floor and G-J placement in
the IR suite.  It was also felt that his underlying lung process
was due to a significantly more severe process than aspiration
alone.  He was also started on PPN on the evening of [**8-22**] and
received intermittent PPN.  On the evening of transfer he was
permitted to receive supervised milkshake spoon-feeding
administered at bedside by his daughter.

# Hypernatremia:
On [**8-21**] the patient developed hypernatremia to the 140s with a
max of 153 on [**8-22**] in the setting of IV lasix followed by no IV
access.  He was spoon fed water and intermittently received up
D5W with improvement in his Na to 144 on the day of transfer
([**8-24**]).

# ARF:
On [**8-18**] the patient developed a Cr bump to 1.4 in the setting of
lasix administration.  A true vanc trough the following morning
was elevated at 42.  Vancomycin was d/c'd and the patient was
hydrated with D51/2NS.  His creatinine remained elevated, FeNa
was <0.1% on [**8-24**], and his [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix continued to be held
until the patient triggered on the evening of [**8-24**], prompting
him to receive 40 mg of IV lasix prior to transfer to the MICU.

# Rash:
On admission the patient was noted to have a mild petechial rash
and on [**8-12**] the patient the rash was notably brightly
erythematous, purpuric, confluent, and morbiliform rash and
extended to all four extremities and his back.  He has a
concurrent eosinophilia (14.3%).  Biopsy was consistent with
leukocytoclastic vaculitis.  Ddx included vasculitis vs. drug
reaction.  He had started cefepime 3-4 days prior to the rash.
He was continued on cefepime and the rash resolved as did the
eosinophilia (5.5% when last checked on [**8-17**]).

# Transaminitis:
Patient had elevated LFTs at admission, statin was held.  LFTs
trended down, statin was restarted.  LFTs inadvertently checked
[**8-23**], mildly elevated again, statin held.

STUDIES:
[**11-15**] CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
1. Right upper lobe ground-glass parenchymal opacity, suggestive
of
pneumonia. Multifocal coalescent ground-glass nodules,
predominating upper
lobes but also present in left lower lobe, raise question of
metastatic
involvement. Moderate right pleural effusion.

2. Massive conglomerate aortocaval mass with central areas of
necrosis, which compresses the IVC, right common and external
iliac veins, and likely also right proximal ureter. Extensive
mediastinal, hilar, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and iliac
lymphadenopathy and massive splenomegaly. Overall picture
suggestive of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease.

3. Mildly prominent common bile duct. Please correlate with
liver function
test.

4. Diffuse gallbladder mural edema, likely related to systemic
disease,
unlikely due to cholecystitis.

5. Multiple left renal lesions are incompletely evaluated,
including a 12-mm interpolar left renal lesion (3, 301), which
could be further characterized by ultrasound.

[**11-15**] CT Head- 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. 2. Although there is no CT evidence of large
intracranial mass, MRI with gadolinium is superior in evaluation
of such lesions and can be considered if not contraindicated.

[**11-15**] LENI- No evidence of right lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.

[**11-15**] EKG: ST at 108 bpm, no other acute changes

[**11-18**] Trans thoracic Echo- The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**11-25**] Renal U/S: 1. No evidence of hydronephrosis, with
resolution of the mild hydronephrosis seen on CT [**2137-11-15**]. 2.
Nonvisualization of left renal interpolar region indeterminate
lesion seen on CT scan [**2137-11-15**], due to limited visualization.
For further evaluation,if clinically relevant, an MR could be
performed.

[**12-3**] CXR: The heart size remains normal and no typical
configurational abnormalities is seen. Thoracic aorta, stable
and within normal limits. Position of previously described left
subclavian approach advanced central venous catheter remains
unchanged terminating overlying the SVC at the level of the
carina.  No pneumothorax is seen. In comparison with the next
preceding portable examination, the findings have cleared up
markedly. In particular the basal bilateral densities strongly
suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions as seen on [**2137-11-21**], have now practically cleared completely, as both lateral
and posterior pleural sinuses are free with the patient in
upright position. Also, the parenchymal densities have
regressed; however, significant residuals remain on both sides.
These consist of lateral located hazy parenchymal densities
close to the pleural space at the level of the third and fourth
rib. On the left side these parenchymal densities are also in
peripheral location but somewhat higher up and overlying the
second and third ribs including the corresponding interspace. In
comparison with the preceding single view examination, it is
possible that these parenchymal densities have progressed
slightly and thus, further followup chest examinations in this
patient with history of lymphoma is recommended.

[**12-4**] CT Chest: 1. Widespread peripheral consolidations which
are new or increasing. These are not entirely specific, but the
striking peripheral character of consolidations is very
suggestive of an inflammator etiology such as eosinophilic
pneumonia or organizing pneumonia, either of which could be
associated with a drug reaction. The appearance would be much
less typical for an infectious etiology or progression of
lymphoma, which has apparently responded overall very well to
treatment.

2. New mild extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of uncertain
significance. Correlation with liver function tests is
recommended. If the apppearance may be clinically significant
based on laboratory data or clinical presentation, then MRCP
could be considered or follow-up CT or ultrasound. Extrinsic
compression by lymphadenopathy that is not imaged on this study
is a possible, though somewhat unusual, possibility.

[**12-4**] CT Head: 1. No evidence of intracranial metastatic
disease. MR (if feasible) would be more sensitive than CT for
detection of metastatic lesions. 2. No acute intracranial
process.

[**12-9**] CXR: Heart size is normal. Mediastinal position, contour,
and width are unremarkable and stable. The abnormalities
demonstrated on prior chest
radiograph and chest CT appears to be grossly unchanged except
for may be
minimal progression at the level of the left lower lobe and
right upper
superficial area as well as interval development of minimal
amount of pleural effusion on the right. The finding continues
to be nonspecific with the differential diagnosis being broad
including eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia, drug reaction, and less likely infection.

PATHOLOGY:
[**11-17**] Bone marrow biopsy- MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH
EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY A LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, MOST
CONSISTENT WITH DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.

[**11-17**] R axillary lymph node biopsy- DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL
LYMPHOMA, HIGH GRADE.

[**11-17**] Immunophenotyping Flow Cytometry: Immunophenotypic finding
consistent with involvement by a kappa-restricted B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder.  Correlation with concurrent bone
marrow biopsy (S10-48307G) is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
74 year old male with BPH, s/p R inguinal hernia repair present
with pleuritic abdominal/chest pain found to have a extensive
lymphadenopathy throughout torso and aotocaval large
conglomerate mass with compression of IVC and R common iliac
vein.
.
# Lymphoma- Patient was initially admitted to the medical floor
for expedited evaluation of presumed lymhoproliferative disorder
in the setting of CTA which showed bulky lymphadenopathy and
aortocaval large conglomerate mass with
compression of IVC and right common iliac vein. Initial labs in
the ED were remarkable for lactic acidosis with HCO3 of 15 and a
lactate of 7.9. On the medical floor, he was found to have a
uric acid of 13.5 and an LDH of 604 in the setting of normal
calcium/ phosphate/ potassium. He was started on allopurinol and
IVF due to concern for TLS. A heme-onc consult was called and an
axillary LN biopsy showed prelimary path c/w aggressive
lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy eventually showed diffuse large B
cell lymphoma. Patient was noted to have increased work of
breathing with ABG showing worsening acidosis 7.32/19/111 and
lactate of 11.4. A bicarb drip was initiated and due to concern
for worsening lactic acidosis, patient was transferred to the
ICU. Lactic acidosis was attributed to tumor mass necrosis vs.
infection and patient was started on vanc/zosyn/azithro for
pneumonia visualized on CT chest (see below). He received [**Hospital1 **]
for treatment of his lymphoma and tumor lysis labs were
monitored q6 given his spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome on
admission. He received rasburicase for persistently elevated
uric acid and new renal failure (creatinine 1.3 from 1.0) with
improvement of his symptoms. He became fluid overloaded and was
diuresed with lasix. He was called out to the floor where he
received a round of RCHOP with good effect and no subsequent
tumor lysis. He had some mucositis which was managed with pain
medications and mouth care. He was discharged home on D5 RCHOP
with follow up scheduled in the 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] outpatient clinic and
a plan to establish care in NY with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25139**]
(appointment tentatively scheduled for [**12-24**]).

# Pneumonia- Patient had chest CT with ground-glass parenchymal
opacity, suggestive of pneumonia. He was started on
vanco/zosyn/azithro and was continued on these antibiotics for 7
days after he was no longer neutropenic per pulmonary
recommendations. Repeat imaging with CT scan showed widespread
peripheral consolidations concerning for an inflammatory
etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia,
but ultimately attributed to resolving pneumonia in the setting
of a reconstituted immune system as the patient was asymptomatic
and appeared well. Patient will need repeat imaging in [**12-22**] weeks
after discharge to assess progression.
.
# Rash- Patient developed an erythematous papular eruption on
his back as well as a well demarcated erythematous plaque on his
lower L back. Dermatology was consult and attributed the former
to a resolving drug reaction and that latter to a contact
dermatitis. Triamcinolone was applied topically to the plaque
with gradual improvement.
.
#. Fluid retention: Patient received fluids as part of his
chemotherapy regimen. His weight increased 10 lbs over several
days secondary to fluid retention. He was diuresed with good
effect and subsequently reaccumulated fluid in his legs with the
second round of chemo. He was restarted on lasix and sent home
to continue diuresis with f/u in the outpatient clinic.
.
#. Headache: Patient complained of mild intermittent R
retro-orbital pain without associated visual changes, diploplia,
or floaters. Was seen by opthalmology who attributed his eye
symptoms to dry eyes. CT head w/ and w/o contrast was negative
for bleeds and metastatic disease.
.
# Shingles- Patient complained of continued post herpetic
neuralgia related to his shingles episode six months earlier.
His pain was managed with lidocaine patches and
oxycodone/oxycontin.
.
#. BPH: No active issues. Patient was continued on finasteride
and tamsulosin as his home BPH medications were not on
formulary.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 87754**],

You were admitted to the hospital with chest and abdominal pain.
You had a CT scan of your chest, lymph node and bone marrow
biopsies which showed that you have diffuse large B cell
lymphoma. You received two rounds of chemotherapy while you were
in the hospital. You were also diagnosed with a pneumonia for
which you were treated with antibiotics. You will need to have a
repeat CT of your chest in [**12-22**] weeks to assess the improvement
of this infection. Your body was retaining fluid so you were
started on a water pill to help remove some of this fluid.
Please continue to take this at home as directed until you
follow up on Friday. Please also weigh yourself daily and call
Dr.[**Name (NI) 14047**] office if your weight increases.

We have made the following changes to your medications:
- START taking filgrastim (injections) as directed for your
blood counts
- START taking fluconazole for prevention of infection
- START taking acyclovir for prevention of infection
- START taking ranitidine for your stomach
- START taking oxycontin for your pain; please take colace and
senna as needed while taking this medication to prevent
constipation; do not drive while taking oxycontin as it is
sedating
- START taking lasix for the fluid in your legs
- START taking potassium as directed while taking lasix
- you may use gelclair as needed for mucositis pain in your
mouth

You make continue taking your other medications as you were
previously.

It was a pleasure taking care of you. We wish you a speedy
recovery.

Followup Instructions:
Please come to the 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Outpatient Clinic at 10:00AM on

Chief Complaint:
dysgerminoma of the right ovary

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
diagnostic laparoscopy
total abdominal hysterectomy
left salpingoopherectomy
pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection
omentectomy
cystoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 yo P0 who presented following discovery of
disgerminoma of the right ovary.  Dr. [**Known lastname **] was in
her usual state of good health until [**2159-6-12**].  She
presented at that time to [**Hospital 1559**] Medical Center with acute
severe abdominopelvic pain.  She was found to have a torsion of
the right ovary and underwent an emergent exploratory
laparotomy,
right salpingo-oophorectomy.  Final pathology revealed a 15 cm
serous cystadenoma of the ovary with a 1 cm disgerminoma of the
ovary focussed within the center.  She had this surgery through
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 22790**] incision and has healed well from that surgery.
Pathology has been read here at [**Hospital1 188**].  The disgerminoma is identified as well as the serous
cyst.  The report was that the ovary was intact without surface
involvement.  The serous cyst was separate.  The patient has had
laboratory evaluations performed postoperatively and these
include an LDH level which is normal, an inhibin level which
evidently was normal, hCG level normal.  She had normal liver
function tests and blood counts as well.  She has been advised
after an evaluation at the [**Hospital 1559**] Medical Center to undergo a
staging laparotomy including hysterectomy, left

2. Scattered upper lobe predominent bilateral peribronchiolar
nodular
opacities which may be due to an infectious/inflammatory
etiology or
aspiration. Bilateral lower lobes and lingular atelectasis.
3. Diffuse low attenuation of the liver compatible with fatty
infiltration.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**9-24**], she underwent diagnostic laparoscoy, converted
to open total abdominal hysterectomy, left salpingoopherectomy,
pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, omentectomy, and
cystoscopy.  Procedure was converted due to difficulty accessing
the lymph nodes.  Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 27357**] operative note for
full details.

Postoperatively, the patient received a TAP block for pain in
the PACU.  She developed tachycardia to 130s.  Preoperatively,
the patient had been tachycardic to 110s.   The patient had
received 6L IV fluids and maintained good UOP.  She also
received 13mg IV morphine and RR went down to 8.   Arterial
blood gas demonstrated hypercarbia with pCO2 to 59.  No
pre-operative Hct was drawn, but the post-op HCT was 27.5.  Her
02 sat was 82% on RA and up to mid 90s on CPAP.  The decision
was made to transfer the patient to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further
management.  On arrival to the ICU the patient's 02 sat 99% on
2L, she was alert, oriented and RR 15, not complaining of any
pain.  She had a one-night [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.

The following were addressed during the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay:

1) Hypoxia:
Her hypoxia was likely multifactorial, associated with
atelectasis and low RR in the setting of a high morphine dose.
The CXR was consistent with atelectasis.  Patient also noted to
have some snoring and full neck likely associated with some
degree of sleep apnea.  She was ruled out for pulmonary embolism
with CT-A. The CT did suggest possible aspiration versus
infectious etiology with ""scattered bilateral
peribronchovascular opacities.""  At the time of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] call-out,
the patient was saturating 98% on 2L oxygen by nasal canula,
which was stable from her presentation to the ICU, mildly
improved.

2) Sinus Tachycardia:
Her sinus tachycardia was of unclear etiology, though clearly
documented prior to going to the OR.  The patient clearly denied
pain, anxiety; her post-op pain was controlled with dilaudid
PCA.  She did describe some difficulty with bowel prep that
could have caused dehydration, but the tachycardia did not
resolve with 6L IVFs despite orbital edema.  Her post-operative
fever could have been contributing to the tachycardia as well.
Telemetry was discontinued upon transfer to the GYN oncology
service.

3) Fever:
The patient spiked a fever to 102.5 the evening of POD#0.  CTA
was suggestive of possible aspiration pneumonia as an etiology.

4) Anemia:
Hematocrit at time of transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was 24.  She was
transfused 1 unit of pRBCs in the ICU in addition to 2 units of
pRBCs she had received intraoperatively in the PACU.

The patient was transferred to the gyn oncology service on
POD#1.  The remainder of her hospital stay was notable for the
following:

1) Apiration pneumonia:
The patient was successfully weaned to room air on gyn oncology
service.  Given that her temperature was still elevated to 101.2
at the time of transfer, she was started on IV clindamycin
empirically for treatment of aspiration pneumonia.  Urine
culture was negative, and blood cultures were still pending at
the time of hospital discharge.  Following initiation of
clindamycin, she remained afebrile for over 24 hours.  She then
respiked to a low grade temperature of 100.6.  Urinalysis was
negative.  CXR was repeated, demonstrating bibasilar opacities
concerning for ongoing aspiration pneumonia.  The patient
spontaneously defervesced, and remained afebrile for the
remainder of her hospital stay.  Clindamycin was discontinued
and levofloxacin initiated.  The patient received 24 hours of IV
levofloxacin and was discharged home on po levofloxacin.  Within
24 hours of discharge, the patient called informing that
insurance would not cover po levofloxacin.  She was switched to
a 10 day course of augmentin and azithromycin.

2) Nausea/emesis
The patient experienced an episode of nausea with small amount
of bilious emesis on POD#3.  Diet was retracted from full
liquids back to NPO with resolution of symptoms.  Diet was
successfully advanced the following day.

She was discharged home on POD#5 in good condition: tolerating a
regular diet, ambulating and voiding without difficulty,
afebrile, saturating well on room air.

Chief Complaint:
Transfer from Outside Hospital with sepsis and bowel leakage
after two laparotomies

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, small
bowel resection with enteroenterostomy, cecal primary closure,
abdomen washout and gastrojejunostomy tube placement.


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 17**] is a 52-year-old female who was transferred from an
outside hospital after being admitted inearly [**Month (only) 205**] with
diverticulitis. The patient was treated withantibiotic therapy
and then underwent exploratory laparotomy
and segmental colectomy with primary anastomosis on [**2156-6-30**]. She spent 10 days in the hospital postoperatively and
was discharged home. She returned shortly thereafter with
increasing abdominal pain and fevers. The patient had a
pelvic abscess with an anastomotic leak and was taken to the
operating room a second time on [**2156-7-20**] for
exploratory laparotomy and abscess drainage. Enterotomies
were made during this exploration and they were repaired with
interrupted silk sutures. The patient was given an end
colostomy and mucous fistula.

Postoperatively on [**2156-7-26**], succus was actively drainging
from the wound. A CT scan was performed which showed
extravasation of contrast from the bowel into the pelvis and out
the wound. The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for tertiary care after that finding.
The patient was initially accepted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
then transferred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] on the Blue Surgery service.

The patient was seen in the surgical intensive care unit in
on arrival. There was bilious drainage from the abdominal
incision and feculent drainage from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain
that had been placed in the pelvis by the previous surgeon.
The patient was explained the risks and benefits of operative
procedure and it was deemed appropriate to operate as there
was significant drainage and it probably would not be
controlled adequately with nonoperative therapy. The grave
situation was explained to the patient and the patient's
daughter, and the patient agreed to proceed and signed a
surgical consent for exploration. Bowel resection, diverting
ostomy and requirement to leave the abdomen open were all
discussed and a consent was signed.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Blue surgery service and
underwent an emergent operation on [**2156-7-27**] (see Dr.[**Name (NI) 11471**] op
note). Postoperatively, her wound healed secondarily with wet to
dry dressing changes twice daily. She underwent CT-guided
drainage of a pelvic abscess with placement of a pigtail
catheter. A G tube and JP drain were also placed. She was
administered antibiotics for organisms isolated from her wound
cultures. One week [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Known firstname 17**] developed a fever/rash and
renal failure thought to be a reaction to an antibiotic, most
likely Zosyn. She also developed a severe skin rash and was
briefly transferred to the SICU for fluid resuscitation. She
recovered from the drug reaction, was transferred back to the
floor. Repeat CT scans of her abdomen showed no new collections,
and she continued to improve. The JP drain was removed on [**8-31**].
She was deemed ready for discharge to rehab on [**9-3**].

Imaging at OSH: Liver u/s with doppler: Coarse echogenic liver,
suggestive of fatty liver but cannot exclude a micronodular
cirrhosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Mild
splenomegaly. patent portal vein. no vevidence of varices or
portal hypertension. A small amount of ascites. 14.cm
echotextures. Spleen 13.8cm.
.
CXR [**2140-7-16**]: RSC in SVC. No acute cardiopulm processes.
.
Abdominal ultrasound [**2140-7-18**]:
IMPRESSION:  Very limited study.  TIPS stent is patent but
velocities could not be obtained due to respiratory motion and
therefore satisfactory baseline data could not be obtained.
.
Feeding tube placement [**2140-7-20**]:
IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of post-pyloric feeding tube
in the fourth portion of the duodenum.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**2140-7-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Patent TIPS with slightly increased velocities.
2.  New 4 cm echogenic wedge-shaped structure in the right lobe.
 Given its development since examinations of 9 and 11 days ago,
it is unlikely to be a mass, however, MRI can be performed on a
nonemergent basis for further characterization.
3.  Slight increase in ascites.
.
Portable CXR [**2140-7-31**]:
There has been interval extubation and removal of right-sided
vascular
catheter and sheath.  Right PICC line has been placed,
terminating in the
proximal superior vena cava.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits
of normal in size allowing for low lung volumes.  Previously
present mild pulmonary edema has resolved.  There is improved
aeration in the left retrocardiac region with residual patchy
opacity containing several air bronchograms.  Although possibly
due to resolving atelectasis and dependent edema, infectious
pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate setting.  Minor
right basilar atelectasis is noted as well as a possible small
right pleural effusion.
.
Renal U/S [**2140-7-31**]:
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 12.2 cm and the left 11.2
cm.  The renal parenchymal thickness and echogenicity are
normal.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or calculi.
Small amount of ascites is noted.
.
IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable renal ultrasound.
.
EGD [**2140-8-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. A feeding tube passing into duodenum was noted. No
significant varices noted in esophagus. Granularity, friability,
erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance
in the whole stomach
2. Duodenum was not entered due to the feeding tube. No bleeding
noted in stomach.
3. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis/Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis: Admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] from outside hospital after recent variceal bleed
s/p variceal banding. Here, repeat EGD was performed which
showed previously banded esophageal varices and gastric varices
with stigmata of recent bleeding. No new bands placed.
Subsequently underwent uncomplicated TIPS on [**2140-7-16**]. Completed 5
day course of octreotide and 7 day course of levofloxacin for
SBP prophylaxis. Unfortunately, patient continued to
decompensate, with rising bilirubin and INR. She was treated
with lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy. Ultrasound [**7-18**]
and [**7-20**] both showed patent TIPS.
.
Given rising bili/INR, she was given a trial of pentoxyfilline
and ursodiol for suspected acute alcoholic hepatitis.
Corticosteroids not given because of recent bleeding. However,
her synthetic function did not improve, and her creatinine
subsequently rose from 0.6 to 3.0. A diagnostic paracentesis was
performed (on [**7-29**]), which demonstrated no evidence of SBP. Her
pentoxyfilline and ursodiol were discontinued as there was no
clear improvement on treatment. She was started empirically on
octreotide/midodrine for possible hepatorenal syndrome.
Nephrotoxic medications were held and she was given volume
repletion both with normal saline and albumin. Creatinine
subsequently improved to 1.2-1.4 at the time of discharge.
.
For nutritional support a post-pyloric feeding tube was placed
and tube feeds were intiated per nutrition recommendations. She
will be discharged for continued nutritional support to meet
caloric goals.
.
She was seen by social work for substance abuse support. In
addition, she was provided with information on post-discharge
support services.
.
MELD at time of discharge was 33, driven by a bilirubin of 19.8,
creatinine of 1.4, and an INR of 2.9.
.
Diuretics held given renal failure and lack of ascites on
ultrasound, s/p TIPS.
.
# s/p Upper GI bleed: Initial hct was 34 which drifted down to
25 then 21.9 on day of admission. She underwent EGD a few hours
after arrival, and it showed 3 esophageal variceal bands and
gastric varices which had recent stigmata of bleeding but no
active bleeding. She was supported with blood products and
underwent TIPS as above. Her hematocrit subsequently remained
stablized with no further evidence of active GI bleeding. Repeat
EGD on [**2140-8-3**] prior to discharge showed no significant varices
in the esophagus. There was noted granularity, friability,
erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance
in the whole stomach consistent with portal gastropathy, but no
active bleeding.
.
# Acute renal insufficiency:  As outlined above, developed
rising creatinine, initially concerning for hepatorenal syndrome
(HRS), with  UOP <30 cc/hour in setting of known ETOH cirrhosis.
 Started empirically on midodrine/octreotide. However urine
sodium >10, so was not completely consistent with HRS.
Paracentesis [**7-29**] demonstrated no evidence of bacterial
peritonitis. Urinalysis demonstrated no eosinophils. Ultrasound
on [**7-30**] showed no hydronephrosis, but did show a new echogenic
wedge shaped structure in right lobe, of unclear clinical
significance.  No other evidence of infarcts/ischemia were
noted, and lupus anti-coagulant was sent and was negative as
well.  Renal service was consulted and nephrotoxic medications
were held. She was repleted with IV fluids and renal function
subsequently improved, with creatinine trending down from 3.0 to
1.4, with good urine output.
.
# Hypotension: Initially likely from GIB, hypovolemia.
Subsequently remained stable in low 90's-100's systolic, in
setting of chronic liver disease.  Initially started on Zosyn
and Vancomycin as well as Levaquin for concern for infectious
etiology, however antibiotics subsequently discontinued as no
infectious source identified. Of note, blood cultures from [**7-17**]
grew 1/4 bottles STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.  This was
considered contaminant and repeat blood cultures were negative.
.
# HCV: Repeat HCV viral load on this admission ([**2140-7-21**]) showed
no HCV viral RNA.
.
# DM II: On Metformin prior to hospital admission. Covered as
inpatient on sliding scale insulin and glargine. Discharged on
glargine 24units/night, and the patient demonstrated how to use
SSI at home. Metformin and alternative oral hypoglycemics
contra-indicated in setting of her cirrhosis.
.
# HIT antibody positive: HIT antibody sent due to
thrombocytopenia, and was noted to be positive on this
admission; however, she could not be anti-coagulated given her
recent variceal bleed and coagulopathy from liver disease. All
heparin products were held. Platelet count remained low
secondary to liver disease, but stable, with no clear evidence
of clinical thrombosis.
.
# Nutritional Deficiency: Post-pyloric dobhoff placed for
nutritional support to meet caloric goals. Tube feeds will
continue upon discharge with outpatient services arranged.
.

History of Present Illness:
67 year old man 1 month s/p AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3, now with
fever to 100.7, WBC 18.7, and erythema at superior aspect of
wound. Pt recently had a long hospitalization following CABG and
MVR/AVR([**Date range (3) 83151**]), which was complicated by post-op
CVA, aflutter/afib with unsuccessful cardioversion, and a
HA-pna. The pt was discharged with a trach to [**Hospital3 **],
due to his inability to manage secretions. The pt did well at
rehab, until [**2125-10-4**], when he developed a low-grade fever and
CXR showed a new left lung base consolidation. He continued to
have temps to 99, and on [**10-14**] pt was started on ceftriaxone 1g
q24h. On [**10-15**] the pt was also started on vancomycin 1g q12h. Per
rehab reports the pt developed confusion and RR in the high
30's. The pt was thought to be in volume overload, and was given
lasix 20mg IV once on [**10-17**]. Gram stain of sputum from [**10-14**] showed
1= GPCSputum culture from [**10-14**] grew 2+ E. coli that was
pansensitive. Cdiff from that date was also negative. Blood
cultures from [**10-15**] showed no growth on [**10-16**].
In the ED, the pt's triage VS were: T100.7, P71 BP 185/73, RR
20, 99%. Pt had a non-con CT Chest that showed: soft tissue
stranding anterior to sternum, soft tissue stranding and fluid
posteriorly (4cm x 07.cm) adjacent to pericardium which may be
thickened. Tmax in ED 100.9, pt received tylenol. Pt was seen by
CT [**Doctor First Name **] which thought that CT findings were post-op changes, and
recommended continuing vanc/ctx for presumed pna versus
cellulitis. Pt admitted to MICU for further eval.

CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-surgical stranding in the anterior mediastinal space. No
fluid
collection.
2. Tracheostomy tube is 7.6 cm from the carina.
4. Right PICC loops superiorly, malpositioned; consider
readjustment.
5. Mitral and aortic valve replacement.
6. Left moderate-sized pleural effusion and bibasal atelectasis.

7. Gynecomastia.

CXR [**2125-10-24**]
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to
[**2125-10-22**].
The tracheostomy tip is 6.5 cm above the carina. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. The replaced mitral valve is in place.
There is
bilateral pleural effusion and right lower lobe opacity that
might represent a combination of atelectasis and infectious
process. The left retrocardiac atelectasis has also progressed
and might represent an additional source of infection as well.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old man 1 month s/p AVR, MVR, and CABG x 3, now with
fever to 100.9, WBC 18.7 admitted with possible pneumonia and
cellulitis, rule out mediastinitis.

# Fever/Pseudomonal pneumonia: Pt had CT chest that indicated
some stranding around sternum, but thoracic surgery did not
think CT was consistent with mediastinitis, but that changes
were characteristic of post-op changes. No evidence of
cellulitis on exam, and although PICC line appeared normal, it
was removed for concern for line infection. Pt found to have new
ventilator-associated pneumonia, and had bronchoscopy that
showed copious secretions. Sputum grew multi-drug resistant
pseudomonas. During the admission the pt was thought to have had
a ceftriaxone allergic reaction (morbilloform drug rash) and
ceftriaxone was added to allergy list. Pt was discharged to
rehab on tobramycin with plan to complete a 14 day course, that
will be complete on [**2125-11-4**]. He will need his tobra level
checked every 3 days to see if his dose needs adjustment. Renal
function should be checked q3 days while on the tobra to ensure
proper dosing.

# Cardiovascular: EKG improved from prior. No chest pain.
Continued amiodarone, coumadin, statin, aspirin and restarted
beta blocker at a lower dose.

# H/o CVA: Left hemiparesis improved as L LE now has some
strength. He was continued on his statin, aspirin, and coumadin.


# FEN/GI: Continue home Jevity.

# GERD: was continued on home ranitidine
# Access: new PICC line was placed during his admission, old
PICC was removed and had a negative culture.
# Communication: With sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83152**], and

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 61064**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with obtundation after several
days of URI symptoms - she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. A CSF
examination revealed Hemophilus influenza meningitis and she was
cotniued on Ceftriaxone, after Vancomycin and Acyclovir were
discontinued. Her neurologic status improved dramatically and
she recovered full function. However, her course was complicated
by persistent fatigue, hyponatremia (deemed secondary to
meningitis-related SIADH), fever, leukocytosis and an
inflammatory CSF. Follow-up head imaging showed a right frontal
sinus opacification with possible right frontal osteomyeltis.
Her right frontal sinus was surgically evaluated and drained.
Her fevers persisted and no clear alternate source of infection
was found - in her liver, blood, urine (although she had urine
with yeast and no signs of inflammation), or chest.

1. Bacterial Meningitis/Fever: Again, the patient presented with
obtundation and an inflammatory CSF after URI symptoms. She was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a short course and improved
dramatically on Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Acyclovir. Once
Hemophilus influenza was cultured from her admission CSF and
BCXRs, Vancomycin and Acyclovir were discontinued. Although she
improved neurologically, she had persistent fever and increased
serum WBCs. Repeat-LPs showed increased CSF WBCs (to 2500). She
also had persistent tachycardia, presumed secondary to fever.
Her antibiotics were changed to Meropenem, Levofloxacin and then
empiric Vancomycin. Head and spine imaging showed opacification
of the left frontal sinus, possible frontal osteomyelitis and
possible underlying meningeal enhancement, but no abscesses. Her
distal thecal sac and cauda equina were markedly enhancing and
her cauda equina nerve roots were markedly thickened. These
findings were consistent with meningitis. Her right frontal
sinus was surgically evaluated by ENT and drains were placed. Of
note, no purulent material drained from her sinus; she had only
marked mucosal edema. A repeat CSF cytology showed decreasing
WBC and increasing glucose, indicating overall improving
meningitis. Her persistent fever was thought to be [**1-8**] drug
fever from meropenem, as a screen for other sources of infection
 (UA/UCXR/BCXR/CXR/Liver CT) was negative.  Given signs of
improving meningitis by CSF studies and likely drug fever from
meropenem, meropenem was d/c and the pt was placed back on
levoflox with good effect.  Fever resolved after 48 hours off
meropenem, and there no signs of active infection after starting
levoflox.  At the time of d/c, the pt has been afebrile > 48
hours and is near her neurologic baseline on levoflox.  She will
continue levofloxacin after d/c until f/u with [**Hospital **] clinic.

2. Hyponatremia: She was euvolemic to hypovolemic and had a
hypotonic serum. Her sodim levels downtrended intiailly with
normal saline hydration and she nadired at 123. Her clinical
picture and urine electrolytes were consitent with SIADH in
setting of meningitis. She improved slightly with fluid
restriction but also required small boluses of hypertonic
saline.  Renal service was consulted and recommended salt
tablets. She was treated w/ NaCl 3gm PO TID, resulting in marked
improvement in hyponatremia.  At d/c, she is asymptomatic w/
stable sodium.  She will need to continue fluid restriction to <
1 L per day after d/c, and will also continue NaCl tablets until
f/u with her PCP.

3. LDH/ALK PHOS/AST Elevation: She had an incidental rise in
these values in the middle of her course. They were checked as a
screen given her persistent fever. It was possibly related to
high-dose Levofloxacin liver toxicity.  An abdominal CT was
negative for abscess.  After levoflox was resumed towards the
end of her hospital course, LFTs were followed and were stable.
She will require ongoing monitoring of LFTs while taking
levoflox.

4. Left Diagphragmatic Hernia: This was discovered incidentally
on chest x-ray. She was seen by surgery and a likely congenital
(Bochdalek) diaphragatic hernia was diagnosed, without obvious
lung aplasia or dysfunction. She was slotted for follow-up with
surgery as an outpatient for possible elective correction.

5. Hearing loss: she has bilateral hearing loss at the time of
d/c, likely [**1-8**] meningitis.  ENT recommends audiological
evaluation after d/c, w/ close follow-up for 6 months after
resolution of meningitis.  She will f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic after d/c

Chief Complaint:
transfer for management of pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line
Arterial line

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse,
cholelithiasis s/p cholecystectomy, who presents from an OSH
with likely acute pancreatitis.
.
Pt was initially admitted to the OSH [**Date range (1) 29693**] for two
episodes of epigastric pain and abnormal LFTs (AST 466 ALT 268).
US and MRCP were reportedly normal. She was discharged with
diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis. That evening, pt called her GI
doctor complaining of severe abdominal pain, n/v, tremulousness.
She presented to the ED and was re-admitted. She was noted to be
jaundiced, groggy, with a protuberant abdomen. WBC was 13.8, K
2.8, Bili 7.7, AST 324, ALT 370, alk phos 251, lipast 4877. Tox
screen and EtOH levels were negative. Her abdomen became
distended, tense, very tender, with no bowel sounds. She was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring. She was treated
with IVF and aggressive pain control with dilaudid 1mg IV q3.
Additionally she was sedated on precedex and an ativan drip at
4mg/h. Pt was intubated for airway protection on the morning of
[**10-14**]. CT of the abdomen revealed enlarged indistinct pancreas,
extensive peripancreatic fluid consistent with severe
pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis, no loculated or drainable
fluid collections or evidence of perforation. Also noted were
small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate amount of free
fluid in the deep pelvis.
.


Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
==========
Radiology/Neurology
==========
MRCP [**10-16**]
1. Necrotozing, hemorrhagic pancreatitis involving majority of
the body and
tail and portions of the head and neck. Small portion of
enhancing pancreatic
tissue remains in the distal tail and portions of the head.
There is no
pancreatic ductal dilatation, however, a portion in the region
of the genu is
attenuated but not disrupted at this time.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions and small-to-moderate
ascites.
3. The portal vein, SMV, and SMA are patent. Note is made

CT Head [**10-16**]
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhages, edema,
masses, mass
effect, or large area of infarction. The lateral ventricles are
slightly
prominent for age and represent mild volume loss. The sulci are
normal in
caliber and configuration. There is no evidence of bony
fracture.

EEG [**10-17**]
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the moderately severe
suppression of the background throughout. The background was
slow, and
it was intermittent, alternating with much lower voltage
patterns.
There was a brief episode of some ""lightening,"" but the
background
remained encephalopathic throughout. Medication effect is
probably the
most common cause of such recordings. There were no areas of
prominent
focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There
were no epileptiform features.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**10-18**]
No intracranial abnormalities detected. Specifically, no
evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. Incidentally noted adipose
accumulation
over the right malar eminence and right maxillary sinus
air-fluid level.

CT A/p [**10-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe pancreatitis with extensive pancreatic necrosis
sparing portions of
the head and tail.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased.
3. Marked narrowing of the splenic vein and possible non-
occlusive thrombus
within its mid portion.
4. Peripancreatic phlegmon and free fluid in pelvis.


TTE [**10-19**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated
cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). There is a mild resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke
volume due to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No valvular vegetations
identified, but cannot definitively exclude given poor acoustic
windows. Hyperdynamic left ventricular function with resting
tachycardia. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension

CT Chest [**10-23**]
1. Multifocal patchy areas of consolidation may reflect an
infectious
process.
2. Moderate pulmonary edema including moderate pleural
effusions, slightly
smaller compared to the recent abdominal CT.
3. 2.3-cm spiculated right right lobe nodule is worrisome for
malignancy. for
which short interval followup, after patient's acute symptoms
resolved, is
recommended.
4. Anasarca.
5. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis, incompletely assessed.

CT Chest [**10-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval worsening of multifocal areas of consolidation,
probably
reflecting an ongoing infectious process.
3. Moderate pulmonary edema with slightly increased moderate
pleural
effusions bilaterally.
4. 8-mm right lower lobe opacity, smaller compared to the
previously seen 2.3
cm spiculated right lower lobe nodule and probably represents
atelectasis
versus consolidation. A chest CT following resolution of
patient's acute
symptoms is again advised.
5. Anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated to
4788 at the OSH. OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for
pancreatic necrosis. EtOH pancreatitis is the most likely
etiology. She underwent MRCP at our hospital which demonstrated
hemorrhagic, necrotic pancreatitis. Patient was managed
conservatively with aggressive fluid replacement. A surgery
consult was obtained and did not advise any operative or IR
procedures for the peripancreatic inflammation. She subsequently
developed acute lung injury, bilat pleural effusions,
anasarca,and ascites as a result of the severe pancreatitis. Her
course was complicated by vent associated pneumonia as well. She
also showed altered mental status during her ICU stay related to
toxic and metabolic encephalopathy. Patient required insulin
replacement therapy while she was in the unit and on the floor.
She was then transferred from the ICU to the floor. There, she
had PT/OT, blood transfusion for anemia from hemorrhagic
pancreatitis, and diuresis. Before transfer to rehab she was
noted to have significant and had CXR. This showed possible
loculated left upper lobe effusion. She underwent repeat CT of
the chest on [**2164-11-2**] which showed moderate bilateral pleural
effusions and anterior loculated left pleural effusion.  Case
was discussed with interventional pulmonary service and given
the patient's improving clinical status and lack of active
evidence of infection, they recommended not performing a
paracentesis to evaluate the loculated effusion.  The patient
was educated to return if she develops fevers, rigors, sweats,
worsening difficulty breathing.
.
# Altered mental status: Her mental status was altered and
related to toxic and metabolic encephalopathy. Head imaging was
negative (CT and MRI)including EEG. She is back to normal mental
functioning after her prolonged and complicated course.
.
# VAP: Sputum grew MSSA (imipenem sensitive). She was initially
on Vancomycin and imipenem. Vancomycin d/ced ([**Date range (1) 82010**]). She
was transition ed from Imipenem ([**10-16**] ?????? [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin on
[**10-22**], but Imipenem was restarted again given decompensating
respiratory status. CT chest on [**10-26**] was concerning for
worsening multifocal pneumonia, so her antibiotics were changed
from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn. Microbiology data has been
negative since [**10-17**]. 14 day course of antibiotics were completed
on [**10-30**]. Cough improved with expectorant and mucous clearing
device. Before transfer to rehab she was noted to have
significant and had CXR. This showed possible loculated left
upper lobe effusion. She underwent repeat CT of the chest on
[**2164-11-2**] which showed left anterior loculated effusion.
.
# Pulmonary edema/Acute lung injury:  Extubated [**10-21**] but
emergently re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with SVT and
hypotension. Patient was extubated again [**10-25**]. CT chest showed
interstitial changes and pleural effusions. Bronchoscopy on [**10-17**]
was WNL, and samples significant only for 2+ polys and staph
aureus. She continued to receive to Lasix with effective
diuresis.
.
# SVT: Patient has prior h/o of Afib. Reportedly never
anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear to be precipitated by
diuresis. She was emergently re intubated on [**10-23**] during episode
of SVT with hypotension that did not respond to electrical
cardioversion. Patient was loaded on amiodarone and remained in
NSR thereafter. CTA was negative for PE. She was then placed on
maintenance dose of 200 mg /day. Patient was also continued on
home dose of metoprolol.
.
# Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues
to have a hoarse voice. ENT reports vocal cords functional and
will continue to take time to recover.
Plan for pt to f/u with ENT in 2 wks after discharge.
.
# RLL nodule ?????? RLL nodule appreciated on Chest CT. This will
require outpatient follow up in 10 - 30 days after discharge.
PCP was notified on [**2164-11-2**].
.
# Nasal skin necrosis possibly related to her ICU stay. She was
seen by plastic surgery on [**2164-11-2**]. The necrosis is not
infected. They recommended local care and out patient follow up
at their resident clinic.

Ultrafiltration with removal of 18L of fluid

History of Present Illness:
84 yo male with multiple medical problems, including
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD, and history of CVA's
who presented to the ED with a 24 history of weakness, cough,
SOB and nausea. He denied fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal
pain. Emesis x 1 that AM. In ED he was found to be hypoxemic w/
sats 85% on RA, pulmonary edema on CXR and SBP in the 80's. On
presentation, however, the patient was alert and oriented,
appropriate and mentating well. He initially received 2L NS for
IVF hydration, as well as antibiotics including ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, vancomycin for suspected community acquired
pneumonia. The patient then went into rapid afib with HR in the
140's. He was given 5 mg Lopressor IV and his HR decreased to
100. However, the patient's respiratory status declined
precipitously and his sats dipped to 86% on a 100% face mask. He
was placed on a nonrebreather and subsequently intubated in the
setting of impending respiratory failure. Peri-intubation the
patient again became hypotensive with SBP in the 80-60's and was
started on dopamine and dilt for rate control. After intubation
and central line placement, the patient was transferred to the
MICU and admitted with a running diagnosis of sepsis caused by
an underlying community acquired pneumonia.

Although the patient had a extensive medical history and problem
list, prior to presentation and subsequent admission to the
hospital he was fairly independent and ambulatory, living at
home with his wife.

2. Bilateral large pleural effusions with bibasilar
collapse/consolidation.
3. Multiple hepatic cysts.

TTE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-4**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened with the
posterior
leaflet be calcified and prolapsing. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**2158-5-2**], left ventricular systolic function may have
decreased.

TEE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-6**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%)
(intinsic LV systolic function may be depressed given the
severity of mitral regurgitation). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. There is partial
posterior mitral leaflet flail. There is a echodense mass on the
posterior leaflet consistent with probable old vegetation on the
mitral valve; small mobile echodense mass is associated that may
represent a possible new vegetation. Eccentric, anteriorly
directed, moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the tricuspid or pulmonic valves.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Probable old (healed) mitral valve vegetation;
cannot exclude
small superimposed new vegetation. Mitral valve prolapse with
partial flail of the posterior leaflet and moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation. Mild to moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation. Mild to moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation.
Normal biventricular systolic function (LVEF 60-70%)(intrinisic
LV systolic function may be depressed given the severity of
mitral regurgitation).

ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-10**]
Conclusions:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but
cannot be quantified. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)of [**2162-10-6**], there is no significant change

ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-1**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail. Mitral regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2162-10-10**], the mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet is more
prominent. This may
represent a flailed mitral valve leaflet with chordae or it may
represent a vegetation. If the mass is a vegetation, and because
this mass appears
calcified, this mass might be a healed vegetation. The mitral
regurgitation is hard to quantify in this present study.

TEE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-3**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be
more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened, but no
aortic stenosis is present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is partial
flail of the posterior leaflet with leaflet tethering and a very
small (~2mm) mobile echodensity at the leaflet tip that likely
represents a ruptured chordae (cannot exclude a vegetation if
clinically suggested).. An eccentric jet of severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. An echodense ""mass"" is seen in close
proximity to the mitral annulus. This may represent a healed
abscess or
atypical mitral annular calcification. A mobile mass is seen
attached to the posterior leaflet. This may represent a torn
chordae or a healed vegetation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve or tricuspid valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-11-5**] 11:09 AM
IMPRESSION:
1) Worsening pulmonary edema.
2) Moderate bilateral pleural effusions,which have increased
compared to [**2162-10-4**]. There is bibasilar atelectasis as
well. A pneumonia in these consolidative areas cannot be fully
excluded.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-11-15**] 2:48 PM
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: As on the prior study, there are
large bilateral effusions, stable since the prior study. The
previously noted bilateral upper lobe air space disease has
progressed and appears more densely consolidated, particularly
within the right upper lobe, and to a lesser extent the left
upper lobe. Additionally, Hounsfield units within the areas of
dense consolidation measure up to approximately 67 Hounsfield
units, which is denser than simple fluid, indicating complex
fluid, possibly hemorrhage.
A tracheostomy tube is noted. No mediastinal adenopathy.
Bibasilar collapse is once again identified, unchanged. Mitral
valve calcifications as well as coronary calcifications are
seen. A right subclavian line is noted, with its tip in the
superior vena cava.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Multiple low-attenuation lesions
are seen within the liver, measuring up to approximately 6 cm,
probably representing cysts. A gastrostomy tube is noted.
Unenhanced gallbladder, adrenals, kidneys, and spleen appear
normal. The pancreas contains a few punctate calcifications,
with extensive calcifications noted within the splenic artery.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The unenhanced colon, urinary
bladder and seminal vesicles are grossly normal. An open left
inguinal ring containing fat is identified.
BONE WINDOWS: There is severe demineralization within the sacrum
and left iliac bone, with degenerative changes noted within the
remainder of the spine.
IMPRESSION: Dense consolidation within the upper lobes, which is
increased since the prior study dated [**2162-11-5**]. The
density of the consolidation suggests complex fluid and is
compatible with hemorrhage, particularly given the clinical
history.

ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-17**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
There is moderate thickening/calcification of the mitral valve
chordae (no definite vegetation seen; cannot exclude
vegetation/healed vegetation). Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2162-11-1**],
there is no
significant change.

[**2162-12-1**]: Cardiac catheterization: Report pending at the time of
transfer.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU with a diagnosis of sepsis
and community acquired pneumonia. He had a long and complicated
hospital course that will be described by system.

1. Respiratory: The patient was intubated on the day of
admission for hypoxic respiratory failure presumably related to
sepsis and CAP in the setting of baseline CHF. In the ED, the
patient received a dose of ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
vancomycin. He was initially continued on Vancomycin and also
started on Levaquin for ABx coverage for presumed community
acquired pneumonia. Blood cultures drawn on the date of
admission [**10-4**] showed 1/2 bottles positive for Staph Coag Neg.
Further blood cultures were negative. He then developed
ventilator associated pneumonia with MRSA. He was given
Linezolid for coverage of MRSA and completed a 2-week course on
[**2162-10-25**].  He required trach placement on [**2162-10-25**] for failure
to wean. His sputum cultures were repeatedly positive for MRSA
and pseudomonas and enterobacter cloacea througout his
hospitalization. He was treated with vancomycin and meropenem
from [**2162-10-31**] through [**2162-11-13**]. The vancomycin was restarted on
[**2162-11-15**] after he spiked a fever and had MRSA in sputum again and
this was continued until his discharge. He was started on
ceftazidime on [**2162-11-23**] and that was also continued until his
discharge.  He was also treated with Flagyl early in the
hospitalization for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Most recent
sputum cultures from [**2162-11-29**] were positive for MRSA and
pseudomonas sensitive to ceftazidime. His latest ventilator
settings were AC/0.4/TV=600/RR=10/PEEP=5. He had repeated trials
with a Passy-Miur valve that were unsuccessful leading to
coughing fits.

2. CV: The patient was initially hypotensive at the time of
admission, likely related to sepsis +/- possible adrenal
insufficiency. On admission, he was started on stress dose
steroids and overnight remained on dopamine. The patient was
able to be weaned off pressors after the first night, but
subsquently required intermitent use of pressors to maintain his
SBP.

2.1. Rhythm: He was in afib with a rapid ventricular response on
admisison that was treated with a diltiazem drip, lopressor and
digoxin. He developed polymorphic VT with a transition to Vfib
on [**2162-10-23**] that responded to defibrillation. He was started on
a lidocaine drip and then switched to amiodarone. The amiodarone
dose was decreased on [**2162-11-28**] in attempt to decrease the beta
blocker effect in the face of CHF. He is to remain on Amiodarone
200 mg PO daily. He also went into atrial fibrillation early in
the hospital course that resolved with discontinuation of
dobutamine. He was in normal sinus rhythm at the time of
discharge.

3. Mitral Regurgitation: Per echo he has 4+ MR, which has been
refractory to medical therapy. Fluid overload was a major issue.
He underwent ultrafiltation in the CCU for several days with
removal of 18L of fluid. Upon completion of ultrafiltration he
was diuresed unsuccessfully with lasix boluses. He was started
on a lasix drip with a goal of even to negative fluid balance.
However, we were limited given his hypotension and had to be
held frequently. His blood pressure also did not tolerate
nesiritide. Captopril was added at a dose of 12.5 mg TID for
afterload reduction, along with Lasix drip as tolerated by BP.
Digoxin was also added for inotropic effect. Close to discharge,
the patient was tolerating captopril plus intermittent lasix
drip of 2mg/hr titrated to blood pressure. The lasix drip was
converted to a standing dose of 40mg IV BID. Metolazone 5mg po
BID was also added for synergy.  Pt did well on this regimen x
48hrs prior to the time of discharge. Pt was initially informed
that he may be candidate for MV replacement surgery, but was
subsequently refused this surgery by the CT [**Doctor First Name **] service who
felt that his operative risk was too high given his significant
comorbities.

4 History of endocarditis ([**2127**]'s): TEE showed a question of a
vegetation on MV. Subsequently, low suspicion.

5. Agitation: Pt was kept on a standing dose of haldol 2.5 mg
TID which was effective.

7. Nutrition: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a PEG tube and was tolerating tube
feeds using Respalor Full strength at 50cc/hr.  Vit C and Zinc
were added per nutrition recommendations.

8. Endocrine: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has known panhypopituitarism. He was
admitted on prednisone 5 mg daily (home dose). He required
stress dose steroids for his adrenal, subsequently tapered to 20
mg PO daily, on which he remains at the time of discharge.

Regarding his diabetes, serum glucose was well controlled on an
insulin sliding scale starting with 5 units for FSG > 150 and
incrementing by 2 units.

9. Hematology: He had thrombocytopenia initially on admission.
HIT antibody was negative. His thrombocytopenia was subsequently
attributed to Linezolid, and resolved several days after
linezolid was discontinued. Platelet count 170s on day of
discharge.

10. Prophylaxis: Pt was treated with Carafate for GI prophylaxis
(given thrombocytopenia) and Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis.

11. Physical Therapy: Pt was felt to be progressing well from a
PT standpoint. He will need continued aggressive PT follow-up.

12. Access: A right subclavian was placed on [**2162-11-14**] and a PICC
line was placed on [**2162-11-30**].

History of Present Illness:
The patient a 69 year old woman with a history of hypertension,
diabetes, and dementia now presenting on transfer from [**Hospital3 **]Hospital with a large left temporo-parietal bleed.  The
details of her history are sparse and are taken primarily from
her OSH chart.  She presented originally on [**7-22**] complaining of
worsened shortness of breath and generalized weakness.  A
tentative diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was made and she was
treated with lovenox.  She was also noted to be febrile and to
have slurred speech on admission.

Today, the medical staff noticed that the patient was not moving
her right side and was ""relatively unresponsive.""  A head CT was
then performed which showed a large bleed as described above.
Arrangements were made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for ICU level
care.

Head CT [**2173-7-26**]:
There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left
frontoparietal region with extension into the ventricular
system. There is a moderate amount of edema surrounding this
hemorrhage and there is mass effect and approximately 1.4 cm of
midline shift to the right. There is subfalcine herniation.
Blood is seen in the left lateral ventricle as well as the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle. The sulci and
gyri of the entire left cerebral hemisphere are effaced. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation within the right hemisphere is
preserved. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures
are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses show
opacification of the right sphenoid sinus.

IMPRESSION: Large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with extension into the ventricular system, mass
effect, midline shift, and uncal herniation. If prior
examinations exist, they would be helpful for comparison to
detail interval changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for management of her large
intraparenchymal bleed.  The etiology was thought to be most
likely from amyloid angiopathy.  The neurosurgery team consulted
and the patient and discussed options with the family and it was
decided that surgery (draining the lesion) would not likely
benefit the patient.  She was loaded with dilantin.  Her exam
remained stable.  The family made the patient DNR but not DNI.
A family meeting was held and the family decided in favor of
placing a tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube.  These procedures
were done without complication.  The patient was initially
placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis due to her ICH.  She
had no events and the dilantin was eventually d/c'd.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  She has a goal SBP of
110-150.  The patient did appear to have a slight rash on her
truck upon d/c that was attributed to her dilantin that was
recently d/c'd.  On [**7-31**] she spiked a fever to 103 she remianed
febrile for ~ 5 days.  Eventually she had a sputum culture + for
staph aureus.  The patient was started on levofloxacin for a 10
day course.  At the time of d/c she was afebrile.  She was
accepted for placement at [**Hospital3 7**].

CTA abdomen ([**1-25**]): 1. No acute process in the abdomen or
pelvis; specifically, no evidence of mesenteric ischemia. 2.
Stable hypodense lesion within the pancreatic body likely
represents a lipoma or interposed fat as this lesion is stable
from [**2106-12-3**] exam. If there is strong clinical concern, an MRCP
may be obtained. 3. Left renal hypodense cyst. 4. Colonic
diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis. 5. Calcific
density at the pelvic floor, stable from [**2106**], likely represents
a stone within a urethral diverticulum.
.
Colonoscopy ([**1-28**]):  Small internal hemorrhoids were noted. A
single diverticulum with small opening was seen in the sigmoid
colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild severity. No old or
fresh blood was seen in the colon. Impression: Internal
hemorrhoids. Diverticulum in the sigmoid colon. No old or fresh
blood was seen in the colon. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to
cecum.
.
EGD ([**1-29**]): Duodenum: Normal duodenum. jejunum: Normal jejunum.
ileum: Not examined. Impression: Polyps in the pylorus.
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to proximal jejunum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 76F with DM, CAD, and h/o GIB who presents with
GIB and CP. She was admitted to the MICU for monitoring.
Hospital course is discussed below by problem:
.
1. Gastrointestinal bleed.
The history of BRBPR was more suggestive of a lower source. A
brisk upper bleed seemed less likely. Her baseline hct is 30,
and during this admission, it dropped to as low as 23.9. She had
small amounts of bright red blood in her stool, although nothing
to explain the 6 point hematocrit drop. A central line was
placed and she was transfused a total of 9 units PRBCs during
her six-day course in the unit. GI was consulted and performed
both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, although no source of
active bleeding or old blood could be identified. The full
reports are provided above. She was started on IV proton-pump
inhibitor and her hematocrit stabilized in the low thirties on
the fifth hospital day, and remained stable with stable vital
signs. She was transferred to the floors on hospital day 6, and
her hematocrit followed twice daily. After transfer, she had no
more bloody bowel movements. Her Plavix has been held, and her
antihypertensives have also been held. She will follow-up in [**Hospital **]
clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1356**] in one week.
.
2. Chest pain, coronary artery disease, history of CABG.
She has chronic chest pain, and is on 2 anti-anginal
medications. During this admission, she reported intermittent
episodes of angina. EKGs did not show acute changes and cardiac
enzymes were cycled and negative. Her ranolazine was continued
but her Imdur and SL nitros held for concern of precipitating
hypotension. She was transfused a total of 9 units PRBCs to keep
her hct above 25. As above, we have held her Plavix and
cardiovascular medicines at time of discharge given the recent
GI bleed. Her blood pressure has been well-controlled, despite
being off meds, with ranges in the 120s-140s/60-70s. She will
follow-up with her primary care where decision can be made
regarding resumption of her Plavix and CV meds.
.
3. Diabetes mellitus II.
We held her oral hypoglycemics and kept her on sliding scale
humalog insulin. She will resume her oral hypoglycemics after
discharge.
.
4. Hypertension.
As above, her metoprolol, Cozaar, Imdur and triamterene/HCTZ
were stopped in the setting of GI bleed. These can be resumed as
outpatient if her blood pressure warrants additional meds,
although during this admission her pressures have been
relatively well-controlled without.
.
5. Hyperlipidemia.
We continued her outpatient simvastatin.
.
Her diet was progressed as tolerated to diabetic, heart-healthy
diet. Pneumoboots were used for venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Her code status is full code.

EVALUATION:
The examination was performed while the patient was seated
upright in the bed on VICU 11.
Cognition, language, speech, voice: Awake, alert, but slow to
respond, limited verbal output, appearing fatigued. He did
follow
one step commands, though inconsistently, with a delay and with
visual cues/modeling.  Pt's speech was intelligible and fluent,
but responses were very limited. Vocal quality was breathy,
though the pt could generate adequate voicing with effort.

Teeth: Edentulous
Secretions: Mild amount of thick, clear, sputum was stranding
from the hard palate to the tongue. This was removed with the
Yankauer catheter.

ORAL MOTOR EXAM:
WFL for labial and lingual symmetry and ROM. However, both
labial/buccal tone and tongue strength were diminished. Palatal
elevation was symmetrical. Gag was absent.

SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
PO swallowing assessment was completed at bedside with ice
chips,
thin liquids (tsp, cup), purees ( tsp x2), and nectar thick
liquid (tsp, cup). Oral transit was minimally slowed though no
residue was noted. Pt had a difficult time initiating taking any
po's, so feeding was required however he would not open his
mouth
sufficiently to actually allow adequate boluses into his mouth.
Laryngeal elevation appeared adequate to palpation, though he
swallowed multiple times per bolus. He did c/o sensation of
puree
sticking in his throat. Overt coughing was noted with thin
liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration. No further
po's
could be assessed as pt refused any more boluses.

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Pt is demonstrating overt signs of aspiration with thin liquids,
but more significantly is refusing all po's, despite maximal
encouragement. As such, beyond thin liquids the examination was
limited by the pt's fatigue, delayed response time and refusal.
Notes from discharge facility indicate poor po intake has been
an
issue, but the pt was on a full po diet so it appears that he
was
able to advance off of tube feedings. Unclear whether this
decline is related to post op somnolence or possible
toxic-metabolic issues noted per neurology. However, at this
time, I would recommend the pt remain NPO with enteral nutrition
and medications via the PEG. We will plan to re-evaluate pt
later
this week, either [**2199-5-8**] or [**2199-5-9**].

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remain NPO with enteral nutrition and medications via the
PEG.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-5-4**] 9:13 PM

Interpretation: There are several areas of hyperintensity on the
diffusion weighted images. These are located in the right
frontal and left occipital lobes with questionable involvement
of the left frontal lobe. These areas are hyperintense on FLAIR,
raising the possibility that they may represent T2 shine
through. However, these diffusion findings are new since the
prior MR examination. Therefore, these likely reflect relatively
new ischemia, although they may not be truly acute. There is no
evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, or mass effect. The
vessels appear unchanged, with a large right A1, and no
detectable left A1 branch of the anterior cerebral artery.

Impression: Several areas of diffusion abnormality suggesting
recent infarction. No evidence of hemorrhage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-5-4**] 2:36 PM

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. Chronic right frontal and
parietal lobe infarctions are again noted. Marked
periventricular white matter hypodensity is again seen most
consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions. The
ventricles are prominent and similar in size and symmetry.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage. Stable prominent
ventricles.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above
interpretation. However, I am concerned that the CTA may suggest
an arteriovenous malformation. There were numerous prominent
vessels, arterial and venous, and no explanation for the
hemorrhage. I discussed this concern with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71522**] at 9:25
pm on [**2199-5-4**].

Brief Hospital Course:
[**5-1**], Pt admitted had a Infrarenal tube graft repair of
abdominal aortic aneurysm via retroperitoneal approach.

Tolerated the procedure well. Had epidural placed for pain
control .L renal cross
clamp time 25 minutes. Argatroban was administered
intra-operatively

Prolong intubation in SICU / requiring pressure support /
metabolic acidosis

On [**5-2**], there was a period of hypotension to 90s/50s requiring
pressor support, but this was transient.

Pt was extubated on [**5-3**].

Pain is currently being managed with Dilaudid PCA and
Bupivacaine epidural. The last morphine dose was at 4:50pm on
[**5-2**]. Epidural DC by pain service

Pt has been somewhat difficult to arouse with limited speech
output and eye rolling during morning rounds [**5-4**], prompting
consult for seizure evaluation from Neurology

CT scan / MRI done - no acute process. Possible AVM. To be
followed as an outpt. Medications adjusted.

Final neurological - toxic-metabolic encephalopathy related to
post-surgical state and sedative medications (Dilaudid) being
used for pain control

Pt received fundaperinox from transition to coumadin for Afib.
Hx of HIT pos. When INR at goal, Fundaperinox was DC'd.

BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

HISTORY: Thank you for referring this 78 year old male admitted
from [**Hospital1 1501**] on [**2199-5-1**] for AAA repair. AAA was diagnosed when pt
was
admitted [**12-12**] s/p right parietal subacute infarction as well as
right intraventricular hemorrhage. Post op, neurology was
consulted as the pt was somnolent with decreased speech output.
Neurology consult reported that the pt may have toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy related to post-surgical state and sedative
medications being used for pain control. PMH includes:
s/p right parietal subacute infarction and right
intraventricular
hemorrhage,  Seizure disorder, Abdominal aortic aneurysm, Atrial
fibrillation, Hypertension, COPD, CHF, Pulmonary
hypertension,Benign prostatic hypertrophy, T2 compression
fracture found [**2199-1-7**], s/p MRSA bacteremia [**1-13**], s/p
heparin induced thrombocytopenia, s/p cholecystectomy [**1-12**],(+)
UTI.

We were consulted this admission to evaluate whether pt was able
to swallow safely. We evaluated the pt multiple times last
admission with the last examination being a video swallow study
completed on [**2199-2-7**]. That study revealed a mild-moderate
oropharyngeal dysphagia that worsened over time.  After fatigue,
he demonstrated reduced A-P tongue movement, moderate oral
cavity
residue, moderately reduced hyolaryngeal excursion and laryngeal
valve closure, moderate vallecular residue and mild pyriform
sinus residue.  Pt was observed to penetrate both thin and
nectar
thick liquids with eventual aspiration of residue of thin
liquids.

Because pt's oral and pharyngeal muscles fatigued so quickly, he
was at risk to aspirate any texture of solid or liquid over the
course of an entire meal.  As such, we recommended that  the pt
remain primarily NPO at this time with nutrition, hydration, and
medication via PEG.

Per discharge summary from rehab facility, the pt participated
in
speech therapy, had a repeat video swallow study and progressed
to a ground solid, thin liquid po diet while at rehab. However,
his po intake remained poor despite stopping tube feedings and
starting the pt on Megace. However, notes from rehab facility
and
extended care facility indicate the pt was solely on a po diet,
not on tube feedings prior to admission here for AAA repair.

EVALUATION:
The examination was performed while the patient was seated
upright in the bed on VICU 11.
Cognition, language, speech, voice: Awake, alert, but slow to
respond, limited verbal output, appearing fatigued. He did
follow
one step commands, though inconsistently, with a delay and with
visual cues/modeling.  Pt's speech was intelligible and fluent,
but responses were very limited. Vocal quality was breathy,
though the pt could generate adequate voicing with effort.

Teeth: Edentulous
Secretions: Mild amount of thick, clear, sputum was stranding
from the hard palate to the tongue. This was removed with the
Yankauer catheter.

ORAL MOTOR EXAM:
WFL for labial and lingual symmetry and ROM. However, both
labial/buccal tone and tongue strength were diminished. Palatal
elevation was symmetrical. Gag was absent.

SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
PO swallowing assessment was completed at bedside with ice
chips,
thin liquids (tsp, cup), purees ( tsp x2), and nectar thick
liquid (tsp, cup). Oral transit was minimally slowed though no
residue was noted. Pt had a difficult time initiating taking any
po's, so feeding was required however he would not open his
mouth
sufficiently to actually allow adequate boluses into his mouth.
Laryngeal elevation appeared adequate to palpation, though he
swallowed multiple times per bolus. He did c/o sensation of
puree
sticking in his throat. Overt coughing was noted with thin
liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration. No further
po's
could be assessed as pt refused any more boluses.

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Pt is demonstrating overt signs of aspiration with thin liquids,
but more significantly is refusing all po's, despite maximal
encouragement. As such, beyond thin liquids the examination was
limited by the pt's fatigue, delayed response time and refusal.
Notes from discharge facility indicate poor po intake has been
an
issue, but the pt was on a full po diet so it appears that he
was
able to advance off of tube feedings. Unclear whether this
decline is related to post op somnolence or possible
toxic-metabolic issues noted per neurology. However, at this
time, I would recommend the pt remain NPO with enteral nutrition
and medications via the PEG.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remain NPO with enteral nutrition and medications via the
PEG.

IMPRESSION:
Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions. Marked interval

described. No pneumothorax. Increased airspace opacity involving
both lungs may simply reflect low lung volumes, but mild
pulmonary edema is not excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 68 F with ESRD on HD, CHF, Afib on
coumadin; admit to MICU with supratherapeutic INR now s/p 4
units FFP and IV vit K.
.
# Elevated INR. The patient had an elevated INR which was
greater than assay at one point early on in her admission. Of
note, the patient took a bowel regimen for constipation and
reports significant diarrhea prior to admission.  The patient
was not taking excess coumadin doses.  In addition the patient
was on vancomycin for a previous HD catheter infection which
could have contributed to the increased INR.  The patient had no
signs of bleeding at the time of admission or during her
hospitalization.  Her INR normalized with giving IV vit K and 4
units of FFP.  The patient was restarted on coumadin prior to
discharge.  She was discharged on 4mg of coumadin daily with a
follow up INR check at hemodialysis.
.
# Hypotension. The patient became hypotensive with SBPs in the
70s in ED and at HD.  She was admitted to the MICU for
monitoring and her home BP medications were stopped.  She had a
negative blood cx and a negative CXR.  She was receiving
vancomycin with HD for a previous line infection.  Her SBP on
the day of discharge ranged from 100-110s and she was not
restarted on her BP meds prior to discharge.
.
#Hypothyroidism: She had and elevated TSH at 5.2 and a normal
free T4.  Her dose of levothyroxine was increased from 125 to
150mcg daily.
.
# Systolic CHF: The patient has systolic CHF with an EF of 15%.
She received 4 units FFP plus additional IVF while in the MICU.
She did not require early HD as she was not volume overloaded.
Her carvedilol and ACEI were held due to her hypotension and not
restarted prior to discharge.
.
# Diabetes type II: The patient was continued on her home Lantus
and ISS.
.
# ESRD on HD: The patient received HD while at the hospital as
per her normal schedule.  She finished her doses of vancomycin
for her previous line infection.
.
# CAD. The patient has a history of CAD and CABG x2 with CHF.
She was continued on ASA while in the hospital.  The patient was
not able to tell me the name of her new PCP so [**Name Initial (PRE) **] could not find
out why she was no longer on a statin.  I did confirm her
medications with her pharmacy and she was not receiving a
statin.  Her ACE and beta-blocker were held due to her
hypotension.  These medications should be restarted as an
out-patient after follow up with her PCP.
.
#Lesions on back of calf and bleeding of R big toe secondary to
nail clipping.  The lesion of the back of her calf is surrounded
by erythematous tissue suggesting adequate blood flow to heal
the lesion.
.
Left phantom limb pain.  The patient felt her ultram was not
helping her.  She uses a lidocaine patch on her left leg which
provides some relief.  I started gabapentin which the patient
requested to be discharged on.
.
# Full code: discussed with patient

Chief Complaint:
Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastric Ulcers with Bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
66 year old Female with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis due to
hypertensive nephropathy, and h/o NSCLC on Tarceva and
nephrolithiasis who presents with symptomatic anemia.  The
patient typically adjusts her weekly EPO injections between
4000-6000 units depending on her symptoms of fatigue and
dyspnea.  Two and a half weeks ago her dialysis nurse had her
terminate EPO in the setting of an elevated hmg > 12 per her
report. She has been waiting to hear back from her dialysis
clinic regarding when to restart her EPO.  She titrates her own
EPO, given a similar episode of severe symptomatic anemia. In
the interim she developed excruciating flank pain earlier this
week for which she presented to the ED, a CT demonstrated
bilateral stones.  She was given toradol and vicodin and
discharged home with total resolution of her pain.  However, as
the week progressed, she has become progressively constipated
and fatigued with suprapubic abdominal pain.  She reports her PD
fluid has been clear.  She had an episodic visit at [**Company 191**] on
Thursday which prompted referral to the ED. Her blood pressure
was 112/72 laying and 94/68 standing. Blood cultures were taken,
but patient denied any fevers or chills. She got IVF
(approximately 500 cc). Her labs were significant for a
hematocrit of 27, down from 36 on [**2-13**]. She was guiac negative.
Her potassium was elevated at 6, she was given kayexalate. She
had an abdominal CT which showed nothing acute. A CXR was
negative for acute processes. Repeat orthostatics were: lying HR
75 BP 135/63,  standing HR 85 BP 127/61.  On transfer to the
floor her abdominal pain had completely resolved in the setting
of a large dark brown bowel movement after receiving kayexalate.
 She did not receive PD o/n.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR, hematochezia.
She makes trace amounts of urine. She notes acid reflux for the
past 3 days that has been constant. She has only been eating
peppermints do to her poor appetite.

prior, including no evidence of diverticulitis or appendicitis.
.
PORTABLE CHEST XRAY [**2153-2-18**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-15**]:
Mild interstitial abnormality in the right lung is probably
edema. Moderate left pleural effusion is increasing. Large left
lung lesions also appear grown since [**2-15**], though this is
probably mostly a function of projection between the PA and AP
orientations. Heart size top normal. Mediastinal veins and upper
lobe pulmonary vessels are slightly dilated.

Bulbar duodenitis
Brunner's gland hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb

Recommendations:	The findings account for the symptoms, and the
distribution of the gastric ulcers suggests that they are
NSAID-induced.
Continue PPI, avoid all aspirin or NSAID products.
Follow serial Hcts, transfuse PRBCs to Hct >30. Consider DDAVP
and/or platelet transfusion for uremic platelets.
Check H.pylori serology, treat if positive.
Check TTG and IgA to exclude Celiac disease.
If re-bleeds will need repeat EGD.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
Ms. [**Known lastname 92380**] is a 66 year old woman with ESRD on PD, NSCLC, anemia,
and thyroid cancer who presented with an upper GI bleed. She
required multiple transfusions and transfer to the MICU where
upper endoscopy revealed bleeding gastric ulcers secondary to
recent NSAID use.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastric Ulcers with Bleeding,
Duodenitis:
Symptomatic anemia in the setting of a significant drop in Hct
over a three day period. (36->27->22) Etiology initially
concerning for discontinuation of weekly epogen in setting of
elevated hmg on routine lab draw.  The patient has past history
of dramatic hct drop off epo. She received 1x dose of tordol
during ED visit on Monday. No other NSAID use or history of
GERD. Most recent colonscopy in [**2146**] demonstrated multiple
polyps. Follow up colonoscopy deferred given NSCLC. Initially no
evidence of acute bleed, guaic negative stool in the ED prior to
transfer, however on the morning of admission the patient passed
four melanolic stool, guaic positive.  Her hct dropped to 22,
she was transfused 1 unit of pRBC and given desmopressin. Two
PIVs were placed, she was started on PPI gtt and 1 more unit
pRBC and transferred to MICU for EDG and further management. EGD
revealed multiple gastric ulcers in antrum, one of which had
stigmata of recent bleed with overlying dark area. This area was
injected.  There was no evidence of active bleeding.  The
duodenal bulb was acutely inflammed and edematous w/o discrete
ulcer or bleeding.  Patient received additional 2 units pRBCS
after procedure, with subsequent stabilization in HCT and
hemodynamics.  Her diet was advanced to clears, and she was
stable to be transferred back to the general medicine floor.
Her hematocrit continued to be stable.  Pantoprazole was changed
to PO BID dosing which she will continue on for 6 weeks.  She
will discuss further epoitin dosing with her outpatient
nephrologist. Hpylori negative. IgA at normal levels.

# Flank Pain:
The patient has was admitted to the ED prior to admission for
left sided plank pain for which she was prescribed vicodin for
pain managment. An episode of this flank pain recurred on
admission.  Physical exam demonstrated left flank tenderness to
palpation. CT abdomen on [**2-13**] demonstrated bilateral stones and
CT abdomen two days later demonstrated calcified atrophic
kidneys.  Unclear if pain is secondary to stones as patient is
PD dependant and almost anuric. Would consider outpatient MRI to
investigate for nerve impingement.  Her pain was treated with
vicodin.

# Abdominal Pain Diffuse:
Completely resolved in setting of large bowel movement on night
of admission. She was afebrile, but given her history of
peritonitis and PD, fluid sent for culture and gram stain.  Gram
stain revealed 1+ polys and no microorganisms, culture was
negative. Blood cultures were negative at the time of discharge.


# ESRD:
Renal fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding admission. Peritoneal dialysis
was started per home regimen. Epoetin dosing to be discussed
with outpatient nephrologist. The patient became mildly fluid
overloaded in setting of multiple transfusions and clear diet.
CXR demonstrated small pleural effusion. Her PD dialsylate was
adjusted as indicated.

# Hyperkalemia:
Hyperkalemic on admission. She received kayexalate with
improvement in her potassium.  No peaked T waves.

# Hypothyroidism:
Continued home levothyroxine dose.

# NSCLC: On Tarceva every three days. Patient stated she will
not take until appetite improved.  Heme/onc was called, and
placed orders for patient to continue on Tarceva as per home
regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for management of an upper GI bleed.  An upper
endoscopy demonstrated multiple ulcers in your stomach.  It is
likely that the tordol you received during your prior ED visit
precipitated the development of these ulcers.  A small injection
of epinephrine in one of the bleeding ulcers was made which
stopped the bleeding.  You required multiple blood transfusions.
You were started on pantoprazole twice daily. You will need to
continue this medication for six weeks and then may take it just
once daily.

You developed left sided flank pain that appears to be an
intermittant chronic issue. Please discuss with your primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] MRI to explore the cause of your intermittant
spasms.

Please discuss with your nephrologist how much epoetin you
should be taking.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo female with h/o anemia, dementia and afib presents with
bradycardia and hypotension that improved with atropine.
.
*Bradycardia: This is likely due to high doses of 2 nodal
blocking agents, the doses of which have been increased in the
past few weeks. She was hypotensive on admission, this was
likely due to her bradycardia and resolved with normalization of
her heartrate. Dig level not elevated, cardiac enzymes negative,
potassium level was normal.  Her diltiazem was discontinued and
the dose of her metoprolol was cut in half.  The doses of these
medication will need to be titrated at rehab.
.
*Afib: Pt with history of afib but EKG c/w aflutter with
variable conduction on admission. Medication doses adjusted as
above.  Coumadin continued with goal INR [**2-10**]
.
* Renal insufficiency: Cr elevated at 1.4 from baseline of 0.8-1
on admission; this resolved with improvement in heartrate
overnight and was back to baseline at 1.0 on discharge.
.
* Hypothyroidism: On levothyroxine.  TSH elevated and Free T4
slighly low.  Levothyroxine dose increase.  Needs repeat TFT's
in [**4-14**] weeks.

Chief Complaint:
neck swelling


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left neck exploration and drain placement
intubation and mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
30F with a history of [**Doctor Last Name 9376**] disease and chronic
pancytopenia/neutropenia who is re-admitted with reaccumulation
of fluid following initial drainage of posterior/parapharyngeal
abscess on [**2124-2-23**].

She initially presented ~3 weeks ago with neck/swallowing pain
and was found to have the above abscess on CT imaging, which was
drained and cultures ultimately grew beta streptococcus group A
and propionobacterium acnes. She was treated with meropenem for
this (changed to ertapenem upon discharge). Her initial
hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 61436**]) was complicated by intubation for
airway protection x several days, neutropenia (WBC nadir 0.6
with 67% neutrophils on [**2-26**]), anemia to Hct < 21 (received 2
units pRBCs). She also developed left IJ nearly-occlusive clot,
which was not felt to be septic in origin. After multispecialist
discussion, the decision was made not to anticoagulate as risks
were felt to outweigh benefits. She was seen by hematology
during that admission and started on Neupogen, which was stopped
when WBC count came > 3500. She had planned follow up as an
outpatient for ? BMBx in early [**Month (only) 116**].

After returning home, she initially stabilized and felt she was
beginning to improve; however, her husband noticed after several
days that she was developing increased swelling at the surgical
site as well as increased drainage. She also had increased pain
and developed nightsweats, though temps were in 99s (no true
fever). She came back to ED where CT scan showed re-accumulation
of fluid, and she was taken back to OR [**2124-3-14**] by ENT for
drainage. She spent the night in SICU for observation, where she
has done well from a surgical perspective (3 drains in place, no
airway compromise).

Currently she has minimal complaints of neck pain well
controlled with dilaudid PCA.  Has no difficulty swallowing,
breathing or speaking.


Past Medical History:
#Neutropenia of unknown etiology - diagnosed 2 years ago,
baseline WBC 1.8, had serial blood tests in [**Location (un) 18317**] for 8 weeks
and as WBC stayed stable no treatment was initiated, had MRI at
the time but no bone marrow, has been told she has splenomegaly,
no history of prior serious infections or hospitalizations aside
from her pregnency though per husband she does take longer to
recover from minor infections
#[**Doctor Last Name 9376**] disease - diagnosed 2 years ago
#Fe deficiency anemia - not currently on iron supplementation
#Hx of Mononucleosis infection
#Warts on feet - on ranitidine, followed by dermatology

Imaging:

[**2124-3-14**]   Radiology CT NECK W/CONTRAST:
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired 2.5 mm axial images of the neck were
obtained following the uneventful administration of 70 cc of
Omnipaque intravenous contrast. Coronal, sagittal reformations
were performed at 2 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: Extensive soft
tissue swelling throughout the superficial and deep spaces of
the left neck and abnormal thickening and enhancement of the
left sternocleidomastoid and posterior cervical muscles are
again seen (2:29). There is increased rim thickening and
enhancement of an organizing fluid collection along the left
neck extending posteriorly (2:33) since [**2124-2-28**], with a
dominant collection measuring 34 x 7 mm (2:28). Previously noted
drains have been removed with subcutaneous gas likely reflecting
packing material within a lateral incision (2:54). No bony
erosions are detected. There is improved retropharyngeal
swelling with decreased mass effect on the neighboring airway,
including slight restoration of the left piriform sinus and
decreased swelling of the left aryepiglottic fold and
epiglottis. The airway remains patent. No new fluid collections
are seen. There is no subcutaneous emphysema. Neighboring great
vessels remain patent, although there is continued marked
narrowing of the left internal jugular vein (2:34) as it passes
through the area of inflammation in the left neck. Included
views of the lung apices demonstrates minimal paraseptal
emphysema (301b:68). The thyroid is normal. IMPRESSION: 1.
Organizing rim-enhancing fluid collection concerning for an
abscess tracking along the left lateral and posterior neck,
overall slightly worsened since [**2124-2-28**], with increased
size of a dominant posterior collection measuring up to 8 mm,
and increased thickeness of an enhancing rind. 2. Improved
retropharyngeal swelling with decreased mass effect on the
neighboring airway, including slight restoration of the left
piriform sinus and decreased swelling of the left aryepiglottic
fold and epiglottis. 3. Removal of surgical drains with
subcutaneous gas in the left neck possibly reflecting packing
material within the surgical incision. 4. Continued severe focal
narrowing the left internal jugular vein as it courses through
the area of inflammation in the left neck.

[**3-25**] Liver U/S:  Normal liver echotexture. No intra- or
extra-hepatic bile duct dilation. The gallbladder is collapsed.

Brief Hospital Course:
30F hx [**Doctor Last Name **] and idiopathic neutropenic who was recently d/c
s/p neck I&D of an infected abscess, now readmitted with
increased drain output and night sweats.  Found with
reaccumulated fluid collection and s/p I&D/washout on [**3-14**].

#Neck abscess: Pt presented to the ED after having previously
undergone a left neck incision for a posterior parapharyngeal
abscess on [**2124-3-4**]. She was treated with IV antibiotics and
discharged with a PICC line and continued ertapenem. She
re-presented on [**2124-3-14**] to the emergency room noting several
days of increasing swelling around the surgical site with
increasing drainage and pain, as well as night sweats and
fevers. CT scan of the neck showed reaccumulation of fluid in
her left cervical region concerning for worsening infection, and
patient was taken emergently to OR by ENT for L neck exploration
and incision and drainage. Procedure was well-tolerated and
proceeded without issue; 3 penrose drains were placed. No
fevers/chills while in house and no signs of sepsis. Was able to
protect airway, breath/swallow comfortably post-op. Per ID, it
was not felt that this episode was antibiotic failure, so she
was continued on meropenem.  She continued to spike temps >101
for the first few days post-op and eventually her fever curve
downtrended.  The penrose drains were removed every 1-2 days
until the final drain was removed on [**2124-3-24**]. Her wound and blood
cultures did not grow any organisms. Pt was treated with
meropenem while hospitalized with initial plan to switch to
ertapenem 2 days prior to discharge. However, LFTs were found to
be elevated on [**2124-3-24**] and [**2124-3-25**], which ID felt may be due to
ertapenem. Pt was then switched to daptomycin with improvement
of her LFTs. She was discharged on daptomycin for an indefinite
treatment course as will be defined by her infectious disease
doctors.

# [**Month/Day/Year **]: LFTs were elevated on [**2124-3-24**] w/ AST 192, AST
184, AP 310, and normal T bili 0.7. Pt's LFTs were also elevated
during prior admission when she was on meropenem and
hydromorphone for pain control. She has also received several
grams of acetaminophen daily during this hospitalization.
Suspect that this is due to a drug effect. Acetaminophen was
stopped and hydromorphone reduced, but LFTs continued ot
increase. Abdominal exam completely benign. RUQ ultrasound also
showed no obvious pathology. ID felt that ertapenem may be
contributing to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was switched for
daptomycin on [**2124-3-26**] with prompt resolution.

#Neutropenia of unknown cause: Baseline WBC per report ~1.8,
unclear etiology for her leukopenia.  Had follow-up with
heme/onc for a ? of WHIM syndrome, was planned for a bone marrow
biopsy as an outpatient.  ANCs were trended throughout without
requiring neupogen administration.  She will follow-up in
outpatient hematology with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**] in mid [**Month (only) **].

Transitional Issues:
-needs close monitoring while on daptomycin for resolution of
infection and myositis (with weekly CK)
-monitor LFTs for resolution of [**Month (only) **]
-needs continued workup for neutropenia

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You came to the hospital for worsening neck swelling and
drainage after your prior neck surgery.  You had a scan, which
showed increased fluid in the previously drained areas of your
neck. Our ENT surgeons re-explored your neck and placed several
drains. You were seen by our infectious disease specialists, who
felt that your symptoms were due to incomplete drainage after
your first procedure. You were continued on antibiotics and your
wound and blood cultures did not grow any bacteria. Your ENT
surgeons slowly removed your neck wound drains and removed your
stitches. You will need to continue IV antibiotics for several
weeks to months. The exact duration will depend on your clinical
progress and the assessments of your ENT and infectious disease
doctors.

We have made the following changes to your medications:

START prochlorperazine maleate (Compazine) 10mg tablets, 1 tab
by mouth every 6 hours as needed for nausea

START docusate sodium 100mg capsules, 1 cap by mouth twice daily

START hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 2 mg tablets, 1-2 tabs by mouth
every 4-6 hours as needed for severe pain. Do not operate
machinery or drive on this medication. Do not mix with alcohol.

START polyethylene glycol (Miralax) 17g powder in packet, 1
packet dissolved in water by mouth daily as needed for
constipation

START daptomycin 350mg IV daily until instructed to stop by your
infectious disease specialist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

Please continue to take your other medications as previously
prescribed. We have made several appointments for you (see
below). We have also arranged for a nurse to come to your home
to administer your medication and to draw your blood labs.

ETT [**2153-4-6**]:
Ms [**Known lastname 24850**] is a 55 year old woman with history of
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension who presents with typical
angina
for several months. She completed 4 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**]
protocol
representing a poor exercise tolerance for her age; ~ 2.8 METs.
The
test was stopped due to fatigue. She complained of substernal
chest
pain ([**7-5**]) 2 minutes into exercise that peaked at 7/10 which
resolved 5
minutes into recovery. There were 0.[**Street Address(2) 20505**] depression at
peak
exercise which resolved upon rest. During recovery she had T
wave
inversions starting from 2 minutes in recovery to 7 minutes in
recovery.
She had a run of atrial tachycardia 2 minutes into recovery
lasting for
6 beats. The rhythm was sinus. The patient was hypertensive at
baseline
however had appropriate hemodynamic response to exercise.
IMPRESSION: Anginal symptoms at low workload with ST changes
suggestive
of myocardial ischemia. Nuclear report sent separately.
.
Nuclear stress [**4-6**]:
Probably normal myocardial perfusion at level of exercise
achieved with mild fixed apicoanterior and apical defect which
is commonly seen with our current camera. However, given the
stress results an LAD distribution lesion can not be excluded.
.
Cath [**4-9**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
single vessel CAD. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
CAD. The
LAD had a 50% stenosis in the mid vessel. The LCx had no
angiographically apparent CAD. The RCA had a proximal 50%
stenosis and a
distal 70% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with an SBP of 154 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and placement of a 2.5x12mm Promus drug
eluting stent
in the mid RCA and a 2.5x12mm Promus drug eluting stent in the
proximal
RCA.  Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent
dissection, and
no residual stenoses.  (See PTCA comments.)
4. The right common femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed
using a
6 Fr Angioseal VIP device.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel CAD.
2. Successful placement of DES to RCA.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 55-year-old woman with a past medical history of DM
II, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and a strong family history of CAD who
was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after an ETT suggestive of myocardial
ischemia.  Patient underwent cardiac catherization on [**4-9**] and
had 2 DES placed to RCA.

CAD:  Patient has multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
hyperlipidemia, DM II, and a strong family history of heart
disease.  An ETT on [**4-6**] was suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
Patient underwent cardiac catherization (via right groin) on
[**4-9**] without complications.  Two DES were placed to RCA.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 24850**] was maintained on home lisinopril 10mg qd and started
on Plavix, Toprol 25mg qd, Simvastatin 40mg qd, and ASA 325mg
qd.  She was maintained on telemetry and monitored with serial
EKGs.  Last HgbA1C is 7.9--patient is on 3 oral hypoglycemics as
an outpatient, but may be switched to insulin by primary
provider.  (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] been notified of
patient admission and elevated HgbA1C).  Patient will follow-up
with Dr.[**Name (NI) 3733**] in cardiology clinic on [**4-17**].
.
ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION:  Patient with known allergy to aspirin
including shortness of breath, chest pain, and diaphoresis.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 24850**] was successfully desensitized to aspirin in CCU on
[**4-8**] via ASA desensitization protocol.  She should continue
taking aspirin daily; if she fails to do so, her allergy may
return.
.
DIABETES:  Patient with DM II for the last ~20 years not ideally
controlled on 3 oral agents.  (Last HgbA1C is 7.9).  During this
admission she was started on glargine and an insulin sliding
scale.  Ms. [**Known lastname 24850**] will be discharged on her home
hypoglycemics, but her PCP may decide to switch to insulin for
superior control.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is in agreement with this plan.
.
HYPERLIPIDEMIA:  Patient was discharged on Simvastatin 40mg QD.
.
HYPERTENSION:  Patient was maintained on home ACE-I and started
on Toprol 25mgQD.
.
ANXIETY:  Patient with baseline anxiety, exacerbated by hospital
stay.  Patient was seen by social work consult, and may benefit
from counseling as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 24850**],
It was a pleasure taking care of you on this admission.  You
were admitted to the hospital because of an exercise tolerance
test (stress test), which showed some damaged heart muscle.  You
had a cardiac catherization on [**4-9**] and 2 DES (drug eluding
stents) were placed into your right coronary artery.  IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE A MEDICATION CALLED PLAVIX (CLOPIDOGREL)
UNTIL INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE BY YOUR DOCTOR.
.
You also underwent a procedure during which we ""desensitized""
you to aspirin.  You can now take aspirin without having an
allergy to this medication.  It is very important that you take
aspirin every day or else your allergy may return.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
1.  START Plavix (Clopidogrel) 75mg once a day
2.  START Aspirin 325mg once a day
3.  START Toprol XL 25mg once a day
4.  STOP taking omeprazole
5.  START Ranitidine 150mg once a day
.
Please take all of your medications as prescribed.  Please keep
all of your follow-up appointments.
.
Return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, shortness of
breath, severe headache, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, bleeding in your urine or stools, fevers, chills, or
other concerning signs or symptoms.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Agitation, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient was unable to participate in interview with me. This
note is based heavily on the information gathered by the ED
physicians and the Neurologist who consulted in the ED.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 62523**] is a 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse
with recent admission for presumed Wernicke encephalopathy,
alcohol withdrawal who presented from his skilled nursing/rehab
center for agitation after being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] two days
ago. At the rehab facility, the patient spent the last 24 hours
in severe agitation that required 4-point restraints and
multiple chemical restraints in order for him to calm down.

According to the Neurologist in the ED, he was disoriented,
tachycardic, agitated, and diaphoretic in the setting of
presumed 3 days abstinence from benzos. Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**] had some
restriction in eye movements but no gaze deviation and no
lateralizing signs at this point. Neurology believes withdrawal
is the most likely etiology. If fevers develop, he may require a
lumbar puncture. such as infection  Metabolic derangements, drug
overdose, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding can
also mimic or coexist with withdrawal. In the absence of
complications, symptoms can persist for up to seven days.
Additionally as he does not seem to have full abduction of his
eyes, Neurology recommends continuing on IV thiamine for
presumed Wernicke's. Given that the mammillary bodies are
enriched with dopamine receptors, would avoid Haldol as this may
exacerbate his Wernicke Korsakoff's pathology.


Past Medical History:
-HTN
-ETOH abuse
-HCV
-h/o Agoraphobia previously treated w/ sertraline, but stopped
for concern of serotonin syndrome
- Methadone maintenance for opioid detox


Social History:

[**2129-9-14**] CXR:
FINDINGS:  A single portable supine chest radiograph was
obtained.  Exam is limited by patient rotation.  Lung volumes
are low.  Pulmonary vessels are engorged.  There is no effusion

IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and engorged pulmonary vessels

[**2129-9-15**] EKG:
Sinus bradycardia. Non-specific slight ST segment elevation in
the precordial leads and lateral leads. Possible early
repolarization. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-9-7**]
bradycardia is new, ST segment elevation is slightly more
pronounced and could be rate related.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcohol
dependence who was recently discharged after detoxifying at [**Hospital1 1535**] but also suffering from
Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome, who presented from his nursing
facility with altered mental status.

#. Delirium/altered mental status: Patient had been agitated at
nursing facility. TSH, B12, folate, and lactate all within
normal limits. Ammonia also normal. Patient was been afebrile,
WBC was normal, CXR and UA negative. CT head was negative.
Neurology and Psychiatry consulted.  Psychiatry discovered that
patient was receiving oxazepam at facility. Combined with the
significant (12mg IV) lorazepam he received in Emergency
Department and 5mg IV more on initial evening in ICU,
benzodiazepine intoxication felt to be responsible for much of
altered mental status. Benzos stopped and replaced with Zyprexa
to a maximum dose of 35mg daily with monitoring of QTc (407 on
last day of ICU stay).  Patient continued on folate,
multivitamin, vitamin D and thiamine.  Patient restarted on home
olanzapine 5 mg QAM and 15 mg QPM per psychiatry recs.  EKG was
periodically monitored for prolongation of the QTc. He continued
to be agitated particularly at night and was started on
trazadone 100 mg QHS and mirtazepine 30 mg PO QHS.  He improved
on this regimen.  After originally planning to send the patient
to a dementia unit, eventually his brother made the decision to
take him home with 24 hour supervision at his home.  Vitamin
supplementation was discontinued on discharge as patient is no
longer drinking alcohol.  He will follow up frequently with his
PCP and will also follow up with cognitive neurology.

#. Hyponatremia: Patient presented with hyponatremia.  He may
have been volume down at his nursing facility, esecially if he
has been agitated and unable to take PO. During his last
hospitalization, his sodium was well within normal limits.
Sodium corrected to low normal with maintenance fluids.

# Back pain- Patient has migratory low back pain without any
neurological deficits or signs of infection. This is a chronic
issue for Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**]. He was treated with ibuprofen, tylenol
and lidocaine patch, which helped.

Chronic Issues:
#. Hypertension: Continued home propranolol and lisinopril.

#. Essential tremor: Continued home proprnaolol.

#. Presumed CAD: Continued home aspirin.

#. Presumed BPH: Continued home tamsulosin.

#. Presumed GERD: Continued home omeprazole.

Transitional Issues:
- Olanzapine: maximum dose 30 mg daily in a 24 hour span
- Monitor QTc regularly (goal QTc < 500 ms)Qtc on [**2129-10-4**] 400

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**],

You were admitted to the hospital with confusion and agitation
from your rehabilitation hospital. You were seen by neurology
and psychiatry and your medications were changed.  There was no
infection or new [**Last Name **] problem found.  This may have been due to
a kind of medication called benzodiazepine.  Your agitation and
confusion improved over the course of your hospitalization.  You
also worked with physical therapy and occupational therapy.  You
were treated with tylenol and ibuprofen for your back pain.

We really encourage you to abstain from alcohol.  Any further
drinking will cause your mental status to deteriorate.

Medication changes:
Please take trazadone 100 mg at night
Please take mirtazepine 30 mg at night
Please take acetominophen 325-650mg every 6 hours as needed for

History of Present Illness:
66 yo m with DM, h/o CAD s/p CABG with PCI in '[**99**], severe PVD,
CKD, and s/p Vfib arrest who presents with 1 day of vague
symptoms.  He reports that he started feeling unwell yesterday
afternoon with nausea, lightheadedness, and some shortness of
breath.  He denies chest pain or pressure, palpitations,
vomiting, sweating.  He was noted to be altered by his wife with
concern re: difficulty speaking, perhaps a left sided facial
droop and possible left hemianopsia, but limited evidence for
this.  The patient denies having any difficultly speaking or
visual changes, but says that he was confused and seeing things
that weren't there.  His wife reported to the neurologist that
he never had a facial droop.
.
He reports chronic DOE, no CP at rest or with exercise, +
claudication (calf pain) with ambulating 2 blocks, denies
orthopnea, sleeps on 4 pillows at night.  + PND.  He reports LE
edema at baseline.  He lost 10 lbs over past 3 months, which he
attributes to diet and exercise.

He initially went to an OSH, where CT head was negative.  He was
found to have new [**Last Name (un) **] and elevated cardiac enzymes.  He was
hypotensive at OSH to SBP 80s, started on peripheral dopamine
and sent to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.9 86 94/45 on dopamine 20 95%.
He was also reporting worsening of chronic low back pain. His
exam was notable for [**3-11**] murmur, benign abdomen, rectal was
guaiac neg.  A bedside U/S in the ED was neg for pericardial
effusion.  Cardiology consult was requested for stat ECHO in ED,
to look for new WMA, but was not performed.  EKG was not felt to
be markedly changed from baseline.   There was some concern for
aortic aneurysm given back pain so he had a CT torso w/o
contrast, which was negative for aneurysm.  Vascular was
consulted and felt aortic dissection was unlikely.  Neurology
was consulted for concern re: TIA and they did not feel he had a
primary neurologic process.  Due to persistent hypotension, a
RIJ was placed and he was started on levofed.  He was not given
any antibiotics as he was afebrile without e/o infection.  VS
prior to transfer were 79 93/36 on levofed 0.12mcg, 18 99% on

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo m with DM, h/o CAD s/p CABG with PCI in '[**99**], severe PVD,
CKD, and s/p Vfib arrest who presents with 1 day of vague
symptoms found to have hypotension, [**Last Name (un) **] and elevated CE.

# Shock/Hypotension: On arrival to the ED, patient's exam was
most consistent with cardiogenic shock, with a prior known EF
25-30%. He had no evidence of sepsis or hypovolemia on exam. His
hypotension was likely triggered by new administration of
minoxidil causing hypotension and stress leading to stress and
demand ischemia.  Home BP medications were held, and he was
started on levophed with a goal MAP of 55-60.  On admission to
the MICU, an a-line was placed for monitoring of his blood
pressures. Overnight in the MICU he required increasing doses of
levophed to maintain blood pressure. His CE were trended,
showing elevation of troponin and mild elevation in CK in
setting of acute kidney injury and demand ischemia.  Repeat Echo
showed stable EF of 25-30%, RV free wall hypokinesis and apical
akinesis. The patient was transferred to the CCU for further
management of cardiogenic shock.  Levophed was transitioned to
dopamine and patient was started on lasix gtt for diuresis with
good result.  Dopamine was weaned off on [**2204-4-11**].  Throughout
hospitalization, patient was maintained on therapeutic INR with
coumadin or with therapeutic PTT with heparin gtt given history
of recently diagnosed LV thrombus.  In setting of renal failure,
patient was started on carvedilol on [**2204-4-11**] and was not
restarted on atenolol. As an outpatient, the patient should be
restarted on [**Last Name (un) **] and spironolactone as tolerated by BP and
recovery of kidney function.

Of note, noninvasive blood pressures were difficult to monitor
on patient secondary to severe PVD.  Carotid dopplers showed
possible subclavian steal on right, so BP should be monitored on
left.

# Coronaries: Upon admission serial EKG showed nonspecific ST
changes in the lateral leads, that were initially concerning for
ACS.  Cardiac enzymes were trended, showing elevation of
troponin to 0.95 with only mild CK elevation in the setting of
worsened renal failure (see below) and cardiogenic shock.
Patient continued on ASA, plavix and atorvostatin through
duration of hospitalization.  Atenolol was held secondary to
renal failure and hypotension, and was later transitioned to
carvedilol once cardiogenic shock had resolved. Carvedilol dose
uptitrated to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] by time of discharge but other
anti-hypertensives were held since BP had been so low at
presentation and had not yet rebounded to previously elevated
levels.

# Acute Kidney Injury on chronic kidney disease: Patient
admitted with oliguric renal failure with Cr elevated to 5.0
from baseline of 2.6.  Likely etiology secondary to ATN in the
setting of his ongoing hypotension and poor forward flow.  Renal
was consulted for help with management given his possible need
for catheterization and severe renal dysfunction.  Kidney
function improved with initiation of dopamine and lasix gtt.
Home [**Last Name (un) **] and atenolol were held given worsened renal function.
Renal function was trended daily with creatinine peaking at 6.5.
 On discharge had improved to 3.8 and was trending in the right
direction but will be rechecked on Monday at Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] office.

# Altered mental status/reported neurologic changes: Presented
with vague neurologic complaints of confusion, dysarthria, and
facial droop which had resolved by presentation to the ED.
Initially the patient was noted to have some waxing - [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status thought to be secondary to toxic metabolic
encephalopathy from azotemia and cerbral hypoperfusion from
hypotension.  Neurologic exam was nonfocal and mental status
improved through hospital course.  Neurology was consulted and
felt that initial presentation was consistent with a TIA.  For
secondary prevention,  risk factor management was optimized and
patient constinued on strict control of hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension, and on antiplatelet agents. HA1C was found to be
10.6. Patient contined on coumadin to prevent embolic stroke
from known LV thrombus although this was held for a couple days
during hospitalization while there was concern that proceedure
might be needed as below.

# Known LV thrombus: Pt with history of LV thrombus documented
on prior TTE. Had been on warfarin as an outpatient but this was
held for a couple days as inpatient as concern that patient
would need additional invasive proceedures. Placed on heparin
gtt to cover while INR subtherapeutic. Warfarin was restarted 2
days prior to D/c and INR climbing but only up to 1.8 on day of
D/c so pt administered one sub-cutaneous dose of 80mg enoxaparin
on day of discharge and given script for one additional dose of
80mg enoxaparin the next day. Pharmacy was contact[**Name (NI) **] to confirm
that dosing should be 80mg daily for therapeutic
anti-coagulation in setting of improving renal failure.

# Transaminitis: New this admission, likely secondary to poor
forward flow given his presentation of hypotension.  Trended
through hospital course and noted to be downtrending.

# Diabetes: Type II on insulin, on 75/25 [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 387**]
recommendations.  Home regimen was held upon admission given
poor PO intake and patient transitioned to glargine + ISS.
Insulin regimen was adjusted to maintain blood sugars in
100-200. Ultimately put on NPH (70/30) regimen of 15 units in AM
and 15 units in PM with ISS to cover. Discharged on this
regimen.

# Incidental CT findings - noted incidentally on CT A/p. Large
appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary signs of
appendicitis, enlarged pretracheal lymph node and hyperdense
right renal mass that may represent a hemorrhagic cyst requires
outpatient surgical follow-up.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname **], you were admitted to the hospital with low blood
pressure and worsened kidney function. You initially were sent
to the cardiac ICU where medications were used to support your
blood pressure. You had a cat-scan of your abdomen to see if
there was something obstructing your kidenys. You received
contrast with this CT and medications after the CT to protect
your kineys from the contrast. Your warfarin was stopped for a
couple days because we thought you might need additional
proceedures with high risk of bleeding. We also stopped many of
your blood pressure medications because you had such a low blood
pressure initially. Your kidney function has improved and should
continue to improve and your blood pressure has come back up so
we have restarted some blood pressure medications. Your INR is
currently slightly less than 2 even though we have restarted
your warfarin so you will get a shot of lovenox today and give
yourself 1 shot of lovenox tomorrow to make sure your blood is
thin enough until you are seen in clinic on Monday. While you
were in the hospital there was also initially some concern that
you had a stroke. The neurologic service came to see you and
said you did not have a stroke but may have experienced what we
call a TIA with no residual symptoms.
You will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on Monday where you
will have your INR and electrolytes checked.

The following changes were made to your medications:
- Start carvedilol 25mg by mouth twice each day for blood
pressure
- Increase home furosemide to 80mg by mouth once each day for
fluid
- Start enoxaparin 80mg sub-cutaneously for 1 day (only take
this medication on Saturday, then stop)
- Your insulin coverage was changed to NPH 70/30 taking 15 units
in the morning and 15 units in the evening with a sliding scale
to cover your meal time insulin (see attached sheet)
- Continue your home Atorvastatin, warfarin, plavix, aspirin,
folic acid
- Stop all your other home medications for now until further
instructed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: stop minoxidil, hydralazine, isosorbide
mononitrate, spironolactone, cilostazol, atenolol, benicar, your
former sliding scale.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs. Please give yourself your enoxaparin shot on
Saturday as mentioned above. Please make sure to check your
blood sugars before each meal and give yourself the additional
insulin as instructed by the attached insulin slidding scale.

Followup Instructions:
You have a follow-up appointment scheduled on Monday [**2204-4-16**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You will have your INR and electrolytes
checked at this visit.

You also have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11139**] on Thursday [**4-26**] at 12:30pm. At this
appointment you should discuss the findings of your CT scan
described below.

** While you were hospitalized, you received a CT scan of your
abdomen and pelvis to make sure there was no damage to your
kidneys. While your kidneys looked fine there were the following
findings which should be discussed with your PCP at next visit.
1. Unusually large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary
signs of appendicitis. This may represent a mucocele, and
elective resection should be considered.
2. Hyperdense right renal mass may represent a hemorrhagic cyst,
but this is incompletely evaluated with this technique. This can
be further assesed with ultrasound.
3. Enlarged pretracheal lymph node.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory
laparotomy, right
adrenalectomy and right hepatic segment 6 resection. Please see
operative report for details. EBL was 3 liters. An introp U/S
revealed- liver echogenicity appeared unremarkable. Within the
posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, there was s a
5.5 x 3.3 cm well- circumscribed, slightly hypoechoic lesion
that contained a degree of increased through transmission
suggesting at least some cystic components. The relationship of
this to the surrounding vasculature, particularly the posterior
branch of the right portal vein was demonstrated. No other
additional lesions were found.Two [**Doctor Last Name **] drains were removed by
postop day 5. Pathology returned positive for 1. Right adrenal
mass, excision (A-F):
Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical
carcinoma, see note.
2. Liver segment six, resection (G-O):
Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical
carcinoma, see note. Endocrinology was to follow and the plan
was to use ________ as an outpatient.

Postop she was in the SICU for fluid management and ATN.
Baseline creatinine was 0.6. Nephrology was consulted.
Creatinine trended down to 1.1 by POD 8. Renal u/s was normal.
Stress dose steroids were given preop and postop per
Endocrinology. Endocrinology preferred a slow 6 month steroid
taper. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tapered prednisone after one week as she
developed an incision infection necessitating opening the
incision and using a wound vac.  A CT of the abd was done on
which demonstrated Two ill-defined fluid collections
post-surgical site that were extrahepatic and could represent
postoperative seromas, bilomas, or less likely abscesses.
Multiple scattered foci of air, likely postoperative. 2.
Increased stranding about the head of the pancreas, possibly
pancreatitis. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural
effusion. Amylase and lipase were normal. LFTs preop were ast
1298, alt 1308, alk phos 64 and tbili 0.7. These trended down
postop with the exception of the alk phos which increased to as
high as 806 on HD 20. Subsequently, this has decreased some to
504 as of [**11-13**].

She required PICC line placement for IV antibiotics and TPN as
her kcals were insufficient. Her appetite was diminished. She
appeared apathetic on many days and expressed feelings of
sadness. Psychiatry saw her and agreed with the team that she
was experiencing intermittent delerium. There was concern that
she was experiencing the effects of less cortisol. Neurology
recommended a CT and EEG.  A head CT was done for waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status. This was negative for bleed/mass on [**10-29**]. An EEG
was performed which demonstrated mild encephalopathy. TSH was
3.4.  Psychiatry did not recommend antidepressents or stimulants
at the time.

On CT a right pleural effusion was noted. She experienced desats
and sob. Pleuracentesis was performed on [**11-6**] (HD 20)with a
negative culture. A f/u cxr was improved and without
pneumothorax.

She developed a Klebsiella uti which was treated with Cipro and
Flagyl for the wound x 4 days. These antibiotics were switched
to Vanco and Meropenum when a wound culture identified strep
veridans, sparse yeast, Klebsiella which was pan sensitive and
staph coag positive resistent to levo/oxicillin/penicillin and
sensitive to vanco. Vanco levels were monitored. Creatinine
remained stable. She developed a 2nd UTI,yeast which was treated
with a GU Ampho bladder irrigant x3 days. This was due to finish
on [**11-13**] pm. Repeat u/a and cx were sent on [**11-13**].

A repeat abd CT revealed stable appearance of hepatic fluid
collections with some debris and air in the surgical bed.
Bibasilar atelectasis with stable right pleural effusion.
Stable appearance of right abdominal wall defect overlying
surgical site. Interval development of nonocclusive thrombus
within the intrahepatic inferior vena cava. She was started on
coumadin and IV heparin until she was therapeutic. INR Goal was
[**1-31**]. INR on [**11-13**] was 2.6

On [**11-12**] after taking off the vac and reviewing the CT, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**]
drain was inserted thru the wound into a peri-hepatic collection
and placed to bulb suction.  Water soluble contrast was
administered at the bedside through this catheter. Contrast was
administered. Contrast was seen surrounding this wound and
draining along the right lateral aspect of the wound into
dressing, however, no definite communication into the abdominal
cavity noted. Midline chevron scar and multiple clips scattered
across the abdomen were seen. Remainder of abdomen was gasless.
Small amount of oral contrast seen in the rectum.  She then
underwent successful drainage catheter placement in collection
in the subhepatic and hepatic areas on [**2194-11-12**].

The plan is for her to go to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on TPN via a R picc
with a RUQ incision wound vac. She has 2 hepatic drains to
gravity drainage and meropenum/vanco will continue until next
week. She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**11-17**] and
with endocrinology as an outpatient.

Please schedule GYN follow up of postmenopausal bleeding noted
on POD #5.Pelvic U/S (prelim report) - Study v. limited as
patient was not able to achieve proper positioning; uterus 8.0 x
4.4 x 4.5 cm; endometrium is not well visualized; ovaries not
visualized. She experienced minimal spotting while hospitalized.

Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Eye surgery

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 yo female with a history of laryngeal spasm,
possible asthma, and anxiety who underwent elective L eye
cataract removal and trabeculectomy today under general
anestesia with LMA, PACU course complicated by respiratory
distress. She has had prior issues post-op with laryngeal spasm,
sometimes requiring intubation. Her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] notes that her
asthma dx is not clear, and that when she has been intubated,
there does not appear to be any obstructive issues, suggesting
most of her symptoms are upper airway in nature. She has
responded inconsistently to heliox in the past, and at her last
admission at OSH did not tolerate NPPV well, but responded well
to clonazepam.

Regarding recent events, per anesthesia and nursing, she
initially developed dry cough, followed by progressive tachypnea
and dyspnea over the afternoon (from ~2pm to 7pm). Was given
albuterol and ipratropium nebs without significant effect.
Called by anesthesia to see patient around 7pm, given RR
reaching upper 30s and concern for need of NPPV vs invasive
ventilation. Had recently received 60mg solumedrol and racemic
epinephrine without significant effect. Patient notes feeling
dyspneic with dry cough intermittently, as well as wheezy. She
denies fatigue, stating she knows what that implies. No fevers,
pain, dysuria, nausea, vomiting. Detailed ROS not obtained in
setting of patient's respiratory distress.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 yo female with a history of laryngeal spasm,
possible asthma, and anxiety who is in the ICU for respiratory
distress s/p elective eye surgery.

# Respiratory distress: Felt most likely related to paradoxical
vocal cord motion, although quite difficult to tell from
physical exam alone. Panting maneuver did alleviate wheezing.
ENT evaluated and noted only mild upper airway edema. She was
supported with supplemental oxygen and heliox at time. She did
not require NIV or intubation. She was treated with prn nebs,
but no high dose steroids as this was not felt to be consistent
with asthma exacerbation. No clinical evidence of infection. She
was evaluated by PT and cleared for home. She was walked around
the unit and was saturating at 94% on RA. She felt well and safe
to go home. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (her PCP) was called and he felt as though
she was a good judge of being safe to go home.

# Trabeculectomy/Glaucoma: She had her procedure and tolerated
surgery well. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended Tobramycin drops 4
times a day, Tobraymycin oitnment at night, and apraclonidine
[**Hospital1 **] with follow-up early next week.

# Rheumatoid arthritis: Stable. She was continued on imuran.
Humira was to be continued on [**Hospital1 **] weekly.

# Coronary artery disease: Stable. ASA allergy. Continued on
ticlopidine, BB and statin.

# Diabetes type II: Pt denies dx, more likely hyperglycemia that
is steroid related. She was covered with HISS, and [**Hospital1 **]
with diet control.

# Depression and anxiety: Continued on home meds of Abilify,
Duloxetine, and lorazepam.

# Supraventricular tachycardia: Stable. Continued on digoxin,
verapamil, metoprolol

# HTN: Stable during admission. Continued verapamil and
metoprolol.

# Transition issues: She was [**Hospital1 **] home with follow-up
established with Pulmonology, Ophthalmology, and her PCP.

Cardiology reports:
ECG Study Date of [**2158-11-20**]  2:10:10 PM
Sinus rhythm. Low precordial lead QRS voltage is non-specific
and tracing is probably within normal limits. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

ECG Study Date of [**2158-11-22**]  2:21:10 AM
Sinus rhythm with borderline sinus tachycardia. QRS
configuration in
leads III and aVF raises the consideration of prior inferior
myocardial
infarction although is non-diagnostic. Otherwise, tracing may be
within normal limits but unstable baseline and baseline
artifacts in lead V3 makes assessment difficult. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2158-11-20**]
axis is more leftward with a change in QRS configuration in lead
aVF and late precordial QRS transition is present. Otherwise,
there may be no significant change.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2158-11-22**] at 9:31:26 AM
FINAL: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is a mild
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis (velocities increased due to mild left
ventricular outflow gradient). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

ECG Study Date of [**2158-12-11**]  3:01:38 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Consider left atrial abnormality. Consider
prior inferior myocardial infarction, although it is
non-diagnostic. Delayed R wave progression with late precordial
QRS transition. Findings are non-specific. Since the previous
tracing of [**2158-11-22**] no significant change.

Radiology reports:
[**2158-11-20**] 2:23 PM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis,
otherwise normal. Limited study.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST; CT CHEST W/O
CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Right rectus abdominus muscle hematoma.
2. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. 18 x 23 mm hyperdense retroperitoneal lesion within the
aortocaval region, likely a lymph node, new from prior. A pelvic
MR can be obtained for further characterization.

[**2158-11-20**] 7:48 PM BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
IMPRESSION: Extensive venous thrombosis extending through all
the deep veins of the right lower extremity and no evidence of
left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.

[**2158-11-20**] 7:49 PM RENAL U.S.
IMPRESSION: Normal study

[**2158-11-21**] 11:14 AM CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Ovoid area of high density within the aortocaval space at the
level of the IVC filter with adjacent fatty stranding which is
unchanged in size compared to the prior study. This finding is
concerning for a small, atable appearing retroperitoneal
hematoma.
2. Stable right rectus abdominis muscle hematoma.

[**2158-11-23**] 7:42 AM
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT
IMPRESSION: Limited exam, however a small amount of flow is now
visualized in the right common and superficial femoral veins,
which remain partially
occluded. Reconstituted flow within the right popliteal vein is
observed.

[**2158-11-27**] 8:26 AM PORTABLE ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION: Small bowel dilatation most consistent with ileus.

[**2158-11-29**] 3:06 PM LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)
IMPRESSION: Normal-appearing liver without focal lesion or
biliary ductal
dilatation.

[**2158-12-10**] 7:10 PM UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT
IMPRESSION: Limited exam; however, no evidence of DVT. Calf
veins could not be visualized.

[**2158-12-11**] 9:46 AM CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimal contraction in the right rectus sheath hematoma.
2. New asymmetric expansion of the left iliopsoas muscles, with
adjacent left retroperitoneal stranding and small focal fluid
collection posterior to the inferior pole of the left kidney.
Findings are compatible with new left retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. Post-surgical changes in the right groin, without associated
right groin or thigh hematoma. Inflammatory stranding is noted
throughout the soft tissues of the right thigh.
4. Aortocaval density is again demonstrated. As previously
described, it is decreased in size and attenuation, most likely
representing a small resolving hematoma.

Study Date of [**2158-12-13**] 11:22 AM
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval enlargement of left retroperitoneal hematoma, as
described above.
2. New small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Otherwise unchanged CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis
compared to
[**2158-12-11**].

CVICU. Arterial line and central access lines were placed for
blood pressure monitoring. Continued to be oliguric, and
creatinine remain elevated. CPKs were sent that came back
elevated. Reanl consult placed, recommended Bicarb infusion
which was started. In the CVICU patient recieved more blood
tranfusions, started on Neo drip for BP support. Angio
thrombectomy cancelled. Renal service following. Heparin drip
continued. Patient had problems w/ hyperkalemia-treated w/
Insulin/Bicarb/D50/CaGluconate IV.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old man with a history of chronic L>R painful lymphedema
was admitted to the hospital on [**2207-8-16**] with severe cellulitis
which we treated with aggressive ACE wrap and elevation, IV
antibiotics and IV diuresis. Despite antibiotics (vanco, cipro,
flagyl and zosyn) his WBC continues to rise with low grade
temps.   He also developed a new erythema over trunk so ID was
consulted on [**2207-8-20**]. His antibiotics were discontinued and he
was started on ceftaroline.  His cellulitis and rash slowly
improved though his unremitting pain in his LLE continued to
persist. After discussion with palliative care, chronic pain
services and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision was made to go forward
with a Left BKA to improve Mr. [**Known lastname 36515**] quality of life which
was performed (guillotine) on [**2207-8-23**].  At this point, his
antibiotic was then changed to Linezolid.  He returned to the OR
on [**2207-8-28**] for Re-amputation and closure of left below-knee
amputation.  Post operatively in the PACU, he required a brief
reintubation secondary to hypoxia. His CXR was consistent with
pulmonary edema.  He was monitored overnight in the CVICU then
transferred to the floor.

On the floor, he has made steady progress. He has remained
afebrile with baseline renal function and hemodynamically
stable.  He has worked with PT who recommended rehab.
In terms of his medications:
- We weaned his oxycontin from 40mg/day to 30mg/ day on [**2207-9-1**].
 He is due to have it decreased again on [**2207-9-3**]. Since the BKA
he has had minimal pain.
- He was restarted on coumadin on [**2207-9-1**] secondary to his
atrial fibrillation with [**Country **] score of 3.
- We did not restart  Moexipril 30 mg twice daily secondary to
ongoing aggressive diuresis and borderline renal function.
- He will continue on the linezolid until his postop check on
next week.

Medications on Admission:
 ASA325, Amlodipine 10, Carvedilol 25 [**Hospital1 **], Clobestasol qAM,
Furosemide 40'', Glipizide 5, Moexipril 30'', Rosuvastatin 5,

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with worsening left lower
extremity swelling, infection and unremitting pain. Despite
aggressive treatment of your venostasis, profound lymphedema
with elephantiasis, and arterial ischemia we were unable to
adequately control your pain.  It was decided that a below-knee
amputation was the best course of action.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING  AMPUTATION
ACTIVITY: There are restrictions on activity. On the side of
your amputation you are non weight bearing for 4-6 weeks. You
should keep this amputation site elevated when ever possible.
Avoid any pressure to your amputation site.

You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.
No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.

Exercise:Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks. No heavy lifting
greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. Try to keep leg
elevated when able.

BATHING/SHOWERING:
You may shower immediately upon coming home. No baths or
swimming. You may leave your incision open to air. Wash your
incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have sutures,
which are usually removed in 4 weeks.

WOUND CARE:
Keep your wound clean and dry. If there is any drainage cover
with a dry sterile gauze and let your doctor know.

MEDICATIONS:
We started you on a new medication called coumadin to prevent
blood clots from your atrial fibrillation.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36516**], your PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] monitor your INRs and adjust your coumadin dose as needed.
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the
medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a
new prescription for pain medication to be taken if necessary.

We restarted your coumadin on [**2207-9-1**].  Your PCP will manage
your coumadin when you are discharged to home.  We have also
decreased your pain medications.  You were taking 20mg twice
daily of oxycontin prior to admission.  On [**2207-9-1**], we decreased
you oxycontin to 20mg in the AM and 10mg at night.  They will
continue to wean this medication at rehab as tolerated.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70072**] is a 71 yo male who with a PMH of hypertension and
MI, who presents with back pain of 2 weeks duration.  He states
that he first noticed that something was wrong a couple of weeks
ago, after eating eating ice cream and drinking ice water at
night.  Later that night, after going to bed and falling asleep,
he was woken with a strange feeling which he describes as a
curtain descending down over his abdomen.  He states it felt as
if his body, in the region of his abdomen, had just shut down.
He fell back asleep the night, hoping that the strange feeling
would go away on its own.  Over the next few days, he began to
notice a pain in his upper back.  He describes that pain as
similar to a muscle spasm, in his back, that does not radiate.
When the pain first began, it was intermittent and could be
brought on by nearly anything, including getting up to walk and
eating.  He tried Advil and acetominophen which helped at first
to relieve his pain.  He noticed that his pain gradually became
more intense, and more intolerable.  He reports occasional chest
pain, shortness of breath, and feeling feverish when his pain
would become severe. At the time of presentation to an OSH, his
pain was constant, not relieved with Advil or acetominophen, and
he reports it as a [**9-26**].  He also developed a dry,
non-productive cough over the past 2-3 days, and a feeling of
nausea that developed when he would cough.  At times, when the
pain would become severe, he began to feel feverish and
developed sweats.  He reports that his last bowel movement was
nearly a week ago.  Patient reports that he was in Tripoli,
North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s during the Korean war.  Recalls one
episode of walking pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not
hospitalized.  Recalls no episodes of hemoptysis.  He estimates
that he has lost ~10 pounds over the past two months due to
decreased appetite and pain with eating.  He denies chills,
night sweats, changes in vision, headache, shortness of breath,
chest pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, numbness,
parasthesias.

## Hypertension- not on medication
## Cataracts- repaired in right eye
## MI- history of MI in '[**83**] and '[**86**], with balloon angioplasty in

Pertinent Results:
MRI C/T/L spine [**2100-11-29**]:
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM:
There is no evidence of disc infection.  There is degenerative
disc disease at multiple levels.
At C4-C5, there is a small central disc protrusion without
evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis.
At C5-C6, there is a broad-based disc-osteophyte bar producing
moderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.
At C6-C7, there is mild retrolisthesis producing moderate canal
and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.  There is no evidence
of abnormal cord signal or abnormal cord enhancement.
IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative disease as described.
.
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM:
IMPRESSION:  Paraspinal mass with vertebral body involvement at
T7-T8.  There is involvement of the disc, and there is an
epidural mass.  The features in general suggest that this may be
a malignant process rather than an active infection, although
granulomatous disease would be an additional consideration.  The
findings are a bit unusual for bacterial abscess, but this is
not entirely excluded.
.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE:
IMPRESSION:  First degree spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.  Mild disc
bulging.  No evidence of focal disc protrusion.  No evidence of
a destructive mass or abscess in the lumbar region.
.
CT T-spine w/o contrast [**2100-11-30**]:
Again seen is destruction of the inferior one-half of T7 and
superior endplate of T8 with a large associated paraspinal mass.
 There is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion of
bone fragments into the
ventral part of the spinal canal.  The degree of cord
compression is better evaluated on the previous day's MRI.
Again noted is kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at this
locale.  No new abnormalities are identified. There are
emphysematous changes in the lungs.  Aortic calcifications are
identified.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2100-12-2**]:
CT ABDOMEN:  The gallbladder is distended likely due to fasting.
 However,
clinical correlation is recommended.  The liver, spleen, and
pancreas are
unremarkable.  The small 11-mm left adrenal gland nodule is not
well
characterized in this study.  The right adrenal gland is normal.
 Small
hypodense area at the interpolar region of the right kidney is
too small to be characterized.  Small and large bowel are
grossly unremarkable.  There is a moderate amount of stool
within the colon.  The appendix is within normal limits.  Severe
calcifications of the aorta.  All the major branches are patent.
 No free fluid or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS:  Urinary bladder, distal ureters are unremarkable.
No free fluid or free air in the pelvis.  Calcifications within
the prostate. Small segment of chronic dissection involving both
proximal common ilia
arteries.
.
TTE [**2100-12-6**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. LVEF=55%.  The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with focal near akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral
wall. The remaining segments contract well. Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular cavity size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No systolic prolapse is seen. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR PA/Lateral [**2100-12-6**]:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions but no evidence for CHF. Small well defined nodular
density right lung base. Correlate with prior outside films if
available . Further evaluation, either by follow up plain
radiographs in approx 3 months or by CT is suggested.
.
Chest CT [**2100-12-7**]:
The multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are subcentimeter ranging
up to 9 mm in the right paratracheal, 8 mm in the outer
pulmonary, and 1 cm in subcarinal are.  There is no hilar or
axillary lymphadenopathy.  The aorta is calcified with
relatively thick mural plaques ranging up to 4 mm, some of them
ulcerated, for example in the proximal distending thoracic
aorta, series 2, image 26, 27; at the level of the aortic arch,
series 2, image 21; in the distending aorta, series 2, image 31.
 The extensive mural thickening also involve the origin of the
left subclavian and left carotid and innominate arteries.
The assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrate mild
centrilobular emphysema involving predominantly the upper lobes.
 A focal thickening of the left fissure is 4.3 mm in length.
The bilateral pleural effusion is small with adjacent lung
atelectasis.  Additional area of focal pleural thickening is in
the right upper lobe, series 4, image 45.  No other lung nodules
or masses are identified.  The images of the upper abdomen
demonstrate normal liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas and
kidneys.  The gallbladder is markedly distended measuring up to
6 cm in diameter with some high-attenuation of the posterior
portion suggesting vicarious excretion.
.
[**2100-12-17**] U/S:  IMPRESSION: Negative bilateral lower extremity DVT
study.
.
[**2100-12-27**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Increase in size of left pleural
effusion and new relatively large area of consolidation in
lingula and left lower lobe since prior study of [**2100-12-24**].

.
[**2100-12-30**] CT CHEST:  IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in size of a moderate left pleural effusion with
loculated components. High attenuation within a loculated fluid
collection in the left upper hemithorax suggests component of
possible hemothorax and is unchanged. No evidence of new or
active extravasation.
2. Ground-glass opacity at the left base consistent with
reexpansion edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis.
Bibasilar hydrostatic interstitial edema.
3. Stable appearance of postoperative change within the mid
thoracic spine as above.
4. Tiny left hydropneumothorax, likely secondary to recent
thoracentesis
.
[**2101-1-1**] CXR: prelim read: no pneumothorax. small bilateral
effusions.
.
[**2100-12-3**] From surgical specimen: Touch prep of core biopsy, soft

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 71 yo male with history of coccygeal
fracture, and CAD, who presented with back pain of 2 weeks
duration, found to have a T7-T8 epidural mass on MRI. He
subsequently was found to have a MSSA osteomyelolitis, underwent
colpectomy and fusion, however his course was complicated by
post-op NSTEMI, bradycardic arrest (complete heart block), upper
extremity venous clot, and delerium.
.
## Epidural Mass:
Patient presented with back pain of increasing severity of 2
weeks duration, that he rated as [**9-26**] on admission. Patient had
decreased patellar reflexes but no other focal neurological
deficits, and back was non-tender to palpation. No leg weakness,
sensory deficits or bowel/bladder incontinence.  MRI on
admission showed an epidural mass at T7-T8 level with some
moderate cord compression.  CT spine confirmed this finding.
Found to have elevated ESR to 102 and CRP of 216 concerning for
infectious process. Based on imaging the differential of the
epidural mass was infection (bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma),
vs malignancy vs AV malformation. The patient denied any history
or exposure to TB, however he was in North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s
during the Korean war. Recalled one episode of walking
pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not hospitalized. Recalls no
episodes of hemoptysis. The patient denied any history of
malignancy, however he has not seen a physician in many years.
Given the possibility of infection he was started on
broad-spectrum abx including Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and flagyl
IV.  He was afebrile.  Ortho spine followed the patient and he
was provided with a TLSO brace given his T7 collapse.  Serial
neurological exams were performed looking for signs of cord
compression and were normal.  On [**12-3**] the patient underwent
CT-guided biopsy of the mass and tissue was sent to microbiology
 and pathology.  Gram stain and culture returned positive for
GPC.  ID was consulted for further recommendations.  When
organisms were identified as Staph aureus the ceftriaxone and
flagyl were discontinued.  He was continued on vancomycin with
goal troughs 17-20.  When sensitivities returned MSSA the
vancomycin was switched to Nafcillin 2gm IV q4h.
.
ID recommended TTE given epidural abscess and murmur on exam
(unclear age given no regular medical care).  TTE showed no
evidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses.  A
TEE was not performed given the patient would require a long
course of antibiotics and TEE would not change the management.
A PPD was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differential
and was negative.  Additionally, AFB smear and stain were both
negative.  AFB culture is pending.  There was no evidence of
granulomas on CXR or chest CT suggestive of old TB infection.
.
Although the patient appeared to have an MSSA abscess, an
underlying process could not be excluded.  Given possibility for
underlying malignancy an SPEP/UPEP were sent. PSA was 1.0 and
chest CT showed no lung nodules. Path of epidural biopsy showed
inflammation. Given the location of the abscess and involvement
of T7-T8 vertebrae with T7 collapse, the patient was taken to
the OR for surgical spine debridement/stabilization by ortho
spine. He underwent two surgical procedures to debride and
stabilize his spine (please see op notes from [**12-10**] and [**12-13**]
for details).  He should complete a 6 week course of nafcillin
to end on [**2101-1-20**].  He has follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**2101-1-5**] and may need lifelong suppressive therapy.
.
## NTEMI - Two days after his second surgery, the patient
developed chest pain.  An EKG revealed lateral ST depressions.
The pain was relieved by nitroglycerine complicated by mild
hypotension.  His cardiac enzymes were positive with a troponin
T peak of 0.27. His CPK-MB was also mildly elevated to 12.  He
was conservatively managed particularly with regard to his
recent spine surgery.  His cardiac regimen was adjusted to
include aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and Imdur.
.
## Cardiac arrest - The patient's course was further complicated
by a bradycardic arrest leading to asystole.  This episode was
not captured on telemetry. He received CPR as his DNR status had
temporarily been changed peri-operative.  He was resuscitated
successfully without use of epinephrine, atropine, or
electricity.  He was initially stabilized after transfer to the
CCU but had a similar arrest twice the next morning each
following repositioning. Telemetry revealed complete heartblock.
 An externalized pacemaker was placed with a screw-in lead in
the RV as putting a permanent pacer in while the osteomyelitis
was being treated.  The bradycardia appears to have been
triggered by excessive vagal tone.  The day before discharge a
perm. pacemaker was placed and was interrogated by EP and found
to be working well.  He has follow up on [**2101-1-5**] with the
device clinic to further evaluate the pacer.
.
## Anemia: Patient was found to be anemic on admission.  No
baseline for comparison.  Fe studies suggestive of anemia of
chronic disease.  Patient reports no hemoptysis,
hematemesis,melena, or hematochezia. EBL from the surgery was
~500cc.  Late into his CCU stay, he developed guaiac positive
stool.  His Hct stabilized after transfusion.  He continued on a
PPI.  He can follow-up with his PCP for potential referral to GI
for colonoscopy as an outpatient.
.
## Delirium: The patient developed delirium attributed to
medications (narcotics and benzodiazepines), and disruption in
sleep-wake cycle and CCU psychosis.  He was found not to have
capacity to refuse life saving interventions.  His daughter
[**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was appointed health care proxy.  The patient's
agitation was managed with nightly haldol with as needed haldol
as well.  Other sedating medications such as narcotics and
benzodiazepines should be avoided as much as possible. Once he
was transferred to the regular medical floor his delirium
improved and by discharge he no longer displayed any signs of
delirium.
.
## Constipation/diarrhea:  Patient had not had a bowel movement
in over a week when he presented.  He was started on an
aggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement of
large amount of narcotics.  This bowel regimen was weaned down
over the course of his hospital stay.  Since being on the
antibiotics, he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube in
place. The diarrhea could be from an infectious source vs. the
antibiotics themselves.  He was tested for C diff and found to
be negative x3.  A C diff B toxin has been sent and will be
followed up after discharge.
.
## Hypertension:  Patient has a history of hypertension but had
never been treated. BP was initially labile and elevated
readings seemed to correlate with pain.  When pain was better
controlled the patient's BP remained elevated with SBP 140-150
at times.  His blood pressure was controlled as above.
.
## Iliac artery dissections: Incidental finding on CT. Vascular
consult obtained. No evidence of peripheral vascular compromise.
 Vascular team recommended outpatient follow up in 6 months with
ultrasound.
.
## Upper Extremitiy DVT - The patient developed a clot in the
right cephalic vein in the setting of a RIJ central venous
catheter.  He was initially anticoagulated but this was held in
the setting of the GIB.  Warm compresses and arm elevation
should be used to limit propagation of the clot.  The patient
had a CTA of the chest that was negative for PE.
.
## Enterobacter in sputum - The patient did have a sputum
culture that revealed a pan-sensitive enterobacter cloacae.  He
did not have any clinical evidence of pneumonia (no fever,
normalizing WBC, no definitive consolidation on imaging).
Antibiotics, levofloxicin, directed at this bacteria were
started when he was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR and some
shortness of breath. He also developed a large pleural effusion
and underwent a thorocentesis.  The fluid was exudative and
likely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain was
negative (he has been on antibiotics).  The cytology is still
pending and should be followed up by his PCP.
.
## Elevated Creatinine - Creatinine was 1.6 on admission.
corrected following IVF.
.
## Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin converted to [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings and
pneumo-boots with slow GIB.
.
## FEN -Regular diet with 5x/day nutritional supplements with
ensure plus. Did have hypokalemia likely secondary to
medications and loose stools.  He will receive standing
potassium repletion and need potassium level checked shortly
after discharge to adjust the dose.
.
## CODE - DNR/DNI. patient's daughter [**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was
appointed health care proxy during this admission.
.
## Dispo - discharged to rehab

Discharge Instructions:
You have been evaluated and treated for an infection in your
vertebral column.  You underwent 2 surgeries to remove as much
of the infection as possible and to stabilize the spine.
However, after the surgeries you had a small heart attack.  Your
course was further complicated by a very slow heart rate that
required a pacemaker to keep you rate fast enough.
.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
.
You will need to continue the nafcillin until [**2100-1-20**].  You
should follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2101-1-5**] as below to
determine if lifelong antibiotics will be needed.
.
You will need to schedule an appointment with ortho spine Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] (number written below) in mid [**Month (only) **]. You must wear your
TLSO brace for 3months whenever you want to get out of bed and
walk around or sit in a chair. This helps to stablize your back
and is very important to keep from damaging you back.
.
Your new pacemaker is working well. You must keep your
appointment on Wed [**1-5**] at 10am to have it further evaluated.
With your new pacemaker, you must not raise your arm above your
head for 6 weeks.
.
You had some blood in your stool.  You will need an outpatient
colonoscopy in the future.

Service:  Transplant surgery.  #58

ADDENDUM:

The patient was anticipating discharge to the [**Hospital 17300**]
Rehabilitation Center on [**2148-4-4**].  However, the patient
was found to have rising liver function tests with a peak
total bilirubin level of 4.5 and, therefore, underwent an
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure on
this date.  This study demonstrated diffuse dilatation at the
proximal site of the biliary anastomosis, compatible with an
anastomotic stricture.  A 5 cm by #10 French plastic biliary
stent was, therefore, placed.

Following this procedure, the patient felt well clinically
without abdominal pain.  However, his amylase and lipase were
slightly elevated the day following the procedure and he was,
therefore, monitored for possible post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis.  The patient was
maintained on his intravenous diuretics and his liver
function tests slowly returned to [**Location 1867**] following the
procedure.  However, on hospital day number 13, the patient
complained of left upper extremity swelling, which he states
had been there for some months prior to admission.  However,
given the presence of a left subclavian central venous line,
and this new finding on examination, a duplex ultrasound was
ordered for the left upper extremity which was consistent
with a deep venous thrombosis.  The patient was, therefore,
started on a heparin drip to be titrated to a goal PTT
between 40 to 60 seconds. He was also started on Coumadin 5
mg daily towards a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.  At this time, the
patient was progressing well with physical therapy and was
discharged to the [**Hospital 17300**] Rehabilitation Center on hospital
day number 16, on a heparin drip, along with intravenous
Lasix and Coumadin.  His central venous line was removed
prior to discharge.  His heparin drip may be discontinued
once his INR reaches a level of 2.0.  He should be treated
for Coumadin for three months given his left upper extremity
deep vein thrombosis.  He will maintain his Lasix dose at 80
mg intravenous twice a day until his follow-up appointment on
[**2148-4-18**].  He is to have his laboratory studies drawn
twice weekly, on Monday and Thursday, and faxed to the
transplant center for adjustment of his Cyclosporin dosing.
This level is to be drawn two hours after his morning dose.
The patient was instructed to call the transplant center if
he had any other questions or concerns.

Chief Complaint:
right chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 76 y/o female with h/o HTN, dyspepsia, gerd presented
initially to [**Hospital1 18**] with one day of sharp respirophasic chest
pain over the last day. She developed symptoms of a URI
approximately one week prior to admission with cough, sore
throat, and rhinorrhea/post-nasal drip. The cough was
intermittently productive of a clear phlegm. She went to sleep
the night before admission with continued URI sx but awoke at
2am with sharp right sided chest pain, worse with deep
inspiration, radiating to her right shoulder blade and
occasionally horizontally across the cest and up retrosternally.
The pain occurs while ambulating and at rest (no distinct
difference), is not associated with eating, but does get worse
when leaning forward. She denies fevers/chills, n/v/d,
dysuria/hematuria, rashes. She has chronic constipation,
dyspepsia with early satiety, orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion
that has been present and increasing gradually over the last six
months.

The patient had a stress test in the past for left sided chest
pain, without ecg changes, no perfusion defects on MIBI.
She called her PCP who had her get a CXR that showed a right
sided pleural effusion and pleural opacities that was
followed-up with a CTA that failed to demonstrate PE but did
show r. pleural effusion and non-pathologic nodules. An ECG
showed no significant changes from baseline. Her D-dimer was
>[**2193**], wbc 13->11, and LFT's were all within normal limits. The
patient recieved toradol 15mg IV for pain with moderate effect.


Pt had CT that showed exudative right pleural effusion with
negativ ecytology.  She was also scheduled for VATS given
multiple pleural based nodules.  She also developed fever to
101.7, tachycardia, new wheezing and was thought to have pna
with component of RAD/COPD.  Given this new wheeze, she was
started on solumedrol and [**Name (NI) 110238**] (pt without history of RAD).  Pt
developed hypercarbic respiratory failure, initially responded
to nebs but then began to have decreased air movement despite
receiving racemic epi.  Pt was then transferred to MICU for
mgt/observation of airway.  Pt was seen by ENT in MICU who did
not visualize any anatomic obstruction.  Pt put on facemask
bipap on admission to MICU.

ECG Study Date of [**2197-10-23**]  4:58:42 PM
Normal sinus rhythm. ECG is within normal limits. Compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2197-1-20**] no diagnostic interval change.
*
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2197-10-23**] 12:17 PM
New small right pleural effusion with possible subpulmonic
component.
New ill- defined peripheral opacities in right mid and lower
lung zone. In a patient with pleuritic chest pain, pulmonary
embolism should be considered. In the absence of infectious
symptoms, infection is unlikely. Therefore, a CT angiogram may
be considered for more complete assessment as communicated to
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
*
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2197-10-23**] 6:01 PM
FINDINGS: Soft tissue windows reveal a small to moderate sized
right pleural effusion and associated mild atelectasis. There
are several mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest of which is in
the precarinal space and measures 1.4 cm. Lung window images
reveal a rightsided pleurased nodular density and several small
nodules scattered in both lungs, the largest of which is in the
right lower lobe anterior to the pleural effusion and measures 8
mm. Atelectasis is seen at the right lung base. There is no
focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There is a small
pericardial effusion.
CT angiogram demonstrates no pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary
artery is somewhat prominent in size measuring up to 3.5cm. The
aorta is normal in caliber and there is no evidence of aortic
dissection. Calcifications are seen throughout the aorta.
The osseous structures and soft tissues are unremarkable. The
visualized portion of the upper abdomen is normal.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the above
findings.
IMPRESSION: No pulmonary embolus. Right pleural effusion. Small
pericardial effusion. Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with
pulmonary hypertension. Several small nodules within both lungs,
including pleural-based rightsided nodular density. The largest
of these is 8 mm, located in the right lower lobe. These are
nonspecific in nature . Differential diagnosis includes
inflammatory/ infectious process, less likely vasculitis or
neoplastic disease. Correlate clinically and with followup CT
scan.
*
ECHO Study Date of [**2197-10-24**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets
appear
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic
regurgitation.
Based on [**2190**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and
echocardiographic data.

lung, as noted on previous CT scan.
*
CHEST (PA & LAT); CHEST (LAT DECUB)[**2197-11-9**] 1:38 PM
1. Persistent large layering right-sided pleural effusion. If
further detail of the opacities in the right hemithorax would be
helpful clinically, we reiterate the earlier recommendation for
follow-up CT when clinically appropriate.
2. Overall unchanged appearance of the chest.
*
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-11-10**] 12:11 AM
There is a small pericardial effusion, unchanged from the prior
study. There are coronary artery calcifications seen.  There has
been interval development of collapse of the right lower lobe.
The previously seen right pleural effusion has increased in
size, and now is a large right pleural effusion. Within the
right pleural effusion is a focus of air -- Has the patient had
an attempted paracentesis? otherwise this could be a sign of
infection. There is a tiny left pleural effusion as well. In
addition, there is extensive nodular thickening of the pleural
surface which has developed in the interval in the right upper
lobe. The rapidity of this process makes this possibly secondary
to fibrin degradation products.  There is a small calcified
granuloma again seen in the right middle lobe. Again seen is
precarinal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 1.7 cm. There are
small axillary lymph nodes, unchanged. No pneumothorax.  Few
images though the abdomen demonstrate small gastrohepatic
ligament lymph nodes.  BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or
blastic lesion.
IMPRESSION:
1) Interval collapse of right lower lobe with a large right
pleural effusion.
There is a focus of air in the fluid which could be secondary to
an attempted paracentesis, or else infection is a possibility.
2) Interval development of nodular pleural thickening of the
visualized right upper lobe.

*
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2197-11-15**] 3:01 PM
1. Circumferential nodular and irregular thickening of the right
pleural surface, with associated enhancement and pleural
effusion are consistent with neoplastic pleural disease and
malignant effusion. In regions, there appears to be invasion of
the pericardium.
2. There is atelectasis at the right lung base, although
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
3. One of the right-sided chest tubes is malpositioned. Although
the field of view of the CT makes assessment of skin exit sites
difficult, it appears that the chest tube which has a more
anterior position, with only a short segment of the tubing
beneath the skin, is a malpositioned chest tube. Please note
that the chest tube which extends from the lung base to the lung
apex in a vertical configuration, as seen on the chest x-ray, is
appropriately positioned.
4. A focal lytic lesion within the L1 vertebral body could
represent a hemangioma. However, appearances are suspicious for
a metastatic lesion, particularly given the pleural disease
described above. Bone scan would be useful for further
evaluating this lesion, and for evaluation of other occult
skeletal metastases.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year-old female with multiple medical
problems including HBV, fatty liver, colonic mass s/p resection,
HTN, hyperlipidemia, who was initally admitted on [**10-23**]
for increasing dyspnea over the six weeks prior to admission and
increased pleuritic chest pain on the right side.
*
1) DYSPNEA: After admission, a CXR was done which showed a right
sided pleural effusion.  CTA was also done to rule out a
pulmonary embolus.  This did not show a PE; however, showed
several mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest precarinal,
measuring 1.4 cm.  There was also right-sided pleural nodular
densities and several small nodules bilaterally, the largest
located in the RLL anterior to the pleural effusion, measuring
~8mm.  Right lung base atelectasis was present, with a
moderate-sized pleural effusion.  No PE was seen, however.  The
differential at that time was thought to be
inflammatory/infectious, less likely vasculitis or neoplastic. A
follow-up CT was recommended.  On [**2197-10-25**], thoracentesis of the
right pleural effusion was performed by the interventional
pulmonology fellow and the pleural fluid obtained was consistent
with an exudative fluid with an elevated red count (trauma) and
lymphocytsosis.  Cultures of the fluid were negative, and
cytology was negative for malignant cells.  The patient then
developed fevers to 101.7 with new wheezing and was thought to
have a pneumonia with a component of reactive airway
disease/COPD.  On [**10-28**], she was started on
vancomycin/flagyl/levofloxacin (these were later discontinued on
[**11-11**]).  She was also started on solumedrol and MDI's.  On
[**10-30**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] then developed hypercarbic respiratory failure
and was found to have stridor/wheezing on exam which did not
improve with racemic epi.  At this point, she was transferred to
the MICU. In the MICU, the patient was stabilized on BIPAP and
nebulizers.  She was transferred back to the floor on [**11-5**].
After a few days on the floor, the patient again developed
increasing dyspnea.  A CXR was performed which showed an
increase in the size of her right sided effusion.  On [**11-9**],
another thoracentesis was attempted to take fluid off and make
the patient more comfortable; however, fluid could not be
aspirated.  The patient's lung was imaged by the interventional
pulmonology (IP) fellow with US and thick fluid vs. consildation
vs. lung parenchyma was obseved. The IP fellow suggested that a
CT scan be performed for better characterization of the effusion
seen on CXR, as well as VATS to obtain tissue at the pleural
nodule for a diagnosis.  The patient could not lie supine due to
significant respiratory distress, so she was transferred back to
the MICU for elective intubtaion to obtain CT scan and
subsequent VATS.  The repeat chest CT on [**11-10**] showed an
increased right sided collection with worsening atelactasis of
right middle lobe and right lower lobe. There was also increased
nodular thickening of right upper lobe.  On [**2197-11-10**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**]
(thoracic surgery) performed a VATS and pleural biopsy.  Two
chest tubes were placed during the surgery for drainage of her
effusion.  The effusion was loculated, so thoracic surgery used
TPA to break up fibrinous locuations.   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] did well
post-op with only minor pain at the incision site.  This was
controlled with morphine.  On [**11-12**], the patient was trasferred
back to the floor.  She was maintained on nebulizers for
respiratory comfort and morphine for pain control.  On [**11-15**], the
pathology from her pleural biopsy obtained during VATS revealed
a metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  Immunostains were
positive for CEA, cytokeratin, and S100, but negative for
MART-1, TTF-1, B72.3, and calretinin.  The patient was notified
of the results and she reported that she did not want any
chemotherapy.  After agreement by the patient, medical oncology
was consulted to review her case and present the possible
options to her before she made this decision final.  After
seeing oncology, the patient still held to not wanted
chemotherapy.  She said that she wanted to go home to [**State 3914**]
with her son, who is a retired nurse.  Her son decided that he
would care for her in his home.  He arranged to have hospital
bed sent to his home, and arranged to have physician who will
visit Mrs. [**Known lastname **] at home.  An ambulance was arranged to
transport the patient from [**Location (un) 86**] to [**State 3914**].
*
2. PNEUMONIA: The patient had a CXR done on [**10-27**] which showed a
nodular density right mid zone.  Given her fragile respiratory
status, this was treated as pneumonia with
levo/flagyl/vancomycin.  The antibiotic course was continued
from [**10-28**] until [**11-11**].
*
3. NON-ST ELEVATION MI: During her admission, the patient had
episodes of chest pain.  At one point, her cardiac enzymes
trended up to a high of trop = 0.32.  EKG was without changes.
These cardiac enzymes subsequently trended down.  Other episodes
of chest pain on this admission were not accompanied by EKG
changes or elevation of cardiac enzymes.
*
4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: During her admission, the patient had
ARF with a high creatinine of 3.6.  The was likely of prerenal
etiology given her urine lytes at the time.  With IV hydration,
her creatinine trended down, and on discharge was 0.5
*
5.  ANEMIA: The patient had a low Hct throughout her admission
(low 30's to high 20's).  Her stools were guaiac negative. She
was transfused to maintain Hct<30.
*
8.  ABDOMINAL PAIN: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] periodically complained RUQ and
epigastric abdominal pain throughout her admission.  Two RUQ
ultrasounds were obtained which were normal without evidence of
cholelithiasis or cholecystits.  Her LFTs and amylase/lipase
also remained within normal limits.  Her abdominal pain was
thought to be due to peptic ulcer disease.  She was maintained
on her PPI.
*
9.  DIARRHEA: She also complained of diarrhea towards the end of
her hospital course.  She was tested for C. diff, which was
negative x 3.  Her diarrhea was likely a side effect of her
antibiotics.
*
10. HTN: The patient was maintained on her outpatient regimen
for HTN.
*
11. PROPHYLAXIS:  She was maintained on pneumoboots, SC heparin,
bowel regimen, and PPI.
*
12. CODE STATUS: Throughout her hospital admission, the patient
was full code.  After she was given the diagnosis of NSCC, this
issue was re-addressed.  After a discussion with the patient and
her son, she made the decision to change her status to DNR/DNI
and maintained that status on discharge from the hospital.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year-old woman with history of CAD, CHF, copd on
home oxygen, pulm hypertension, polysubstance abuse who
presented to OSH earlier today ([**4-28**]) with altered mental
status. As per records, patient presented after her VNA noted
medical non-compliance and apparent overuse of sedating
medications and summoned EMS. When patient arrived at OSH, the
patient was somewhat confused and hypoxic to high 80's on 3
liters. (Unclear baseline requirement but on home oxygen). Also
tachycardic to 100, tachypneic to mid 20's and hypertensive to
160's. She had low grade fevers to 99. She was felt to be in
congestive heart failure, was noted to have hyperkalemia, and
apparently new renal failure with creatinine in 6's. A central
line was placed but then the patient became agitated,
self-extracted the femoral line. Serial haldol, benadryl and
ativan x3 were not effective in sedating her and therefore the
patient was intubated for airway protection. The femoral line
was replaced. The patient had a NG tube placed, was given
kayxelate, calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and glucose for
hyperkalemia, las well as lasix for CHF. She was given a dose of
levoquin for UTI/possible pneumonia. The patient had an anion
gap acidosis and there was concern for ethylene glycol because
""urate crystals"" were noted in the urine.
.
She was noted to have coffee grounds by NGT.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER. In our ER, received a
tox consult, renal consult, GI consult and CXR. The CXR
confirmed CHF. Flomipazole was given for possible ethylene
glycol intoxication. Renal recommended: no dialysis, give
bicarb. GI recommended: protonix, ffp and vitamin K. Tox: no
other reccs.
.
Vitamin K 10 subcut, 2 units FFP, protonix, insulin, dextrose,
calcium gluconate, Kaexelate and bicarb given.

[**4-30**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial
effusion.
.
[**5-1**] CT TORSO
IMPRESSION:
1. No bowel obstruction is identified. Small bowel and large
bowel loops appear unremarkable.
2. Bilateral increased interstitial markings and septal
thickening is suggestive of presence of the heart failure. The
heart is also mildly enlarged.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and dependent atelectatic
changes are noted at both lung bases. Infiltrate/infection
cannot be ruled out. Small pericardial effusion is also noted.
4. A 4-mm nodule is noted within the anterior portion of the
right middle lobe. Pathologically enlarged right paratracheal
node measures 13 mm in the short axis.
5. Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
6. The aorta demonstrates severe stenosis below the renal
arteries. No aneurysmal dilatation is noted.
7. Small right kidney with normal sized left kidney. No
hydronephrosis or stones are identified.
.
[**5-1**] CT HEAD
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Chronic infarcts in the right cerebellum and centrum
semiovale.
3. Sinus disease involving left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
.
[**5-2**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of
probable
periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (i.e., PLEDs)
involving
the right hemisphere which could indicate a subcortical
abnormality
involving this area. The presence of a diffusely slow background
and
disorganized background is consistent with a mild to moderate
encephalopathy of toxic, anoxic, or metabolic etiology. The
occasional
sharp waves can be a sign of cortical irritability, but clinical

correlation would need to be provided. No evidence for ongoing
seizures
is seen.
.
[**5-19**] ECHO/Bubble study:
Focused study to assess for patent foramen ovale. Images were
obtained at
rest, with cough and post-valsalva release with injection of
agitated saline.
No evidence for an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale
was
identified. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved
global systolic function. No pericardial effusion is seen.
.
[**5-25**] MR spine:  1. Multilevel degenerative changes of the lower
lumbar spine, most pronounced at the L4-5 and the L5-S1 levels
respectively.2. Type [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 13425**] changes of the L4 and L5 vertebral
bodies respectively. 3. No evidence of epidural abscess.
.
[**6-10**] Chest CTA:1. No definite evidence of pulmonary embolus. 2.
Cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema, all
consistent with congestive heart failure.3. Right upper and
right middle lobe pulmonary nodules, little change since [**2167-5-1**]. Six-month followup chest CT is recommended to assess
stability.4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.
.
[**6-15**] ECHO bubble: Saline contrast study performed to assess for
intracardiac shunt. No passage of agitated saline is seen into
the left heart is identified. The left ventricular cavity is
normal in size. There appears to be global hypokinesis that is
more pronounced/worse that the study of [**2167-5-19**].
.
[**6-19**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is [**4-16**]
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). Systolic function of apical segments
is relatively preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild globalfree wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-4-30**], global left
ventricular systolic function is more depressed and the right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated and hypokinetic. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
.
[**6-22**] CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary
lymphadenopathy. There is pretracheal lymphadenopathy measuring
up to 1.5 cm. This is unchanged. There are small bilateral
effusions. These are stable. Again noted is an ovoid nodule in
the apex of the right lung measuring 1.2 x 0.5 cm. This is
stable in appearance. There are tiny nodules in the right lung.
These are again stable. There is diffuse septal thickening which
is unchanged. In the presence of cardiomegaly this is consistent
with CHF.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The liver is without
focal lesions. The gallbladder has been removed. Spleen,
pancreas, adrenal glands are unremarkable. The right kidney is
atrophic. The left kidney has some bulging of the contour at mid
pole measuring about 1.6 cm. This is difficult to evaluate on
the prior study as there is significant artifact from the
patient's body touching the gantry but is likely present. There
is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Small and large bowel are
normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The uterus is normal in
size and contains some calcified fibroids. There is
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. There is no adjacent
inflammatory fat stranding. There is no free fluid in the
pelvis. No pelvic adenopathy is noted. On bone windows, there
are degenerative changes involving the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION:
1. No findings to explain the patient's symptoms. The
examination is essentially unchanged in comparison to prior
studies.
2. Interstitial prominence and small bilateral pleural effusions
with cardiomegaly are consistent with CHF. Again this is stable.
3. Mediastinal adenopathy unchanged.
.
[**6-23**] RUQ US:1. No focal fluid collections. 2. Atrophic right
kidney consistent with chronic renal failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
DISCHARGE SUMMARY (as of [**2167-5-27**])
Assessment and Plan:
This is a 53 year old woman with coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, copd, pulmonary hypertension, s/p L
AKA who is oxygen dependent on nasal canula 4 liters at home,
and polysubstance abuse who presented to [**Hospital3 35813**] Center
in [**State 792**]with altered mental status, hypoxia, and
agitation.  She was intubated for airway protection and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Course complicated by anuric renal
failure requiring dialysis.
.
1)Mental Status change:
Most likely multifactorial, as patient with previous
polysubstance abuse.  Chronic small vessel disease noted on head
CT.  EEG negative for seizure activity.  Per family, patient
lives alone and able to care for herself and perform activities
of daily living.
On admission, toxicology screen revealed opiates and tricyclics,
and by medical notes on transfer, patient had been using more
sedating medications than normal.  Neurology evaluated patient
and vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal.  She received
thiamine.  TSH level was elevated to 8 and her T4 was only very
slightly below normal.  Thus, thyroid function was not
attributed to altered mental status.  An EEG revealed
encephalopathy, but no seizures.  CT head revealed chronic small
vessel disease.  LP and MRI were deferred.
-Upon extubation, patient slowly became more alert, first with
purposeful eye tracking and then by following simple commands.
She received Haldol and Ativan, which sedated her profoundly for
several days. Then, after extubation, she began to have
conversations but with frequent outbursts with cursing at times,
poor attention and short term memory.  She became febrile on
[**2167-5-7**], which was concerning for a line infection, and was
treated initially with Vanco/Zosyn changed to Vanco/Meropenem
plan for 3 day course complete [**2167-5-9**]. C. diff negative x3.  Her
head CT was unchanged.
On [**5-13**], patient had her PICC line and tunneled HD line placed
and developed fevers within 12 hours.  Only one blood culture
from [**5-14**] revealed one bottle of staph coagulase negative
organisms.  Treated with ten day course of vancomycin (per HD
protocol) through [**5-23**].
-Lexapro was restarted on [**2167-5-12**], but held on [**5-22**].
Psychiatry continued to follow patient and for continued
outbursts  recommended haldol 0.5mg PO/IV three times daily.  As
above, concern that heavy sedatives with ativan and haldol cause
profound sedation.  She required soft wrist restraints for
prevention of line removal. Pt was transferred to the MICU on
[**6-2**] for respiratory compromise (see below).
-Upon arriving at the floor on [**6-5**] the patient was AOx3, but
with residual confusion, impulse control issues, and aggitation.
 Her course was complicated by recurrent episodes of aggitation
and anxiety which were hard to control.  She perseverated on her
medications, her course, and her dietary restrictions.  Psych
was consulted and attempted to help control these outbursts
without using benzodiazepems.  She often complained of dyspnea,
but requested ativan as treatment. She was transferred to the
MICU for low O2 saturation, where she was diuresed for
congestive heart failure/volume overload. She was transferred
back to the floor on [**6-15**], where she continued to be anxious and
take off her O2 mask. Psych recommended continuing standing
haldol as well as 100mg neurontin qhs. Benzodiazepines were
avoided. This combination had a calming effect and the patient
was significantly less agitated without being over-sedated,
thought to be back to her baseline mental status.  Remained at
baseline mental status for the rest of the hospitalization
.
2) Respiratory Compromise:
At outside hospital, patient was hypoxic to high 80's on 3L.  At
home, she requires 4L nasal canula.  Patient has history of
COPD, CHF, and pulmonary hypertension per outside notes.
Intubated on transfer and thought that congestive heart failure
contributed to hypoxemic event.  No clear pneumonia.  Patient
was aggressively diuresed via hemodialysis.  She was extubated
on [**5-7**].  Hypoxia seems out of proportion to edema
demonstrated on imaging.  TTE was negative for patent foramen
ovale.
.
On [**2167-6-1**], the patient triggered for hypoxia 68% on 6 liters
(the patient formerly had been 90-92% on 6 liters. On recheck,
the O2 sat was 88% and then 90-91% on 6 liters without
intervention. The patient was scheduled to have HD as scheduled
on [**2167-6-2**].
.
At HD, the HD catheter was noted to be nonfunctioning. TPA was
tried without success. Then, the patient was found to be hypoxic
to 75% at HD with ABG 7.53/26/44 0on a 40% venti mask.  On a
NRB, the patient's saturations improved to 97% and a repeat gas
was 7/53/27/58.
.
The patient denied any chest pain and says the shortness of
breath was not acute in onset but had been developing over the
past few days. However, her SBP was noted to be 188-216 during
HD and the patient was given her am BP meds as a result.  CXR
indicated volume overload and pt. was thought to have had acute
pulmonary edema [**1-9**] hypertension and inability to dialyze.  Pt
was transferred to MICU and had temporary femoral HD line
initially placed, then tunneled HD line placed by IR [**6-3**].  She
had 7L removed during MICU course with improvement of
oxygenation and was sent back to floor [**6-5**].
.
While on the floor she was maintained on 6L of NC.  She did
occasionally complain of dyspnea and anxiety, however it was
hard to differentiate this from her psychiatric issues, as she
was often breathing at a normal rate and sat'ing in the mid 90s
while complaining.  She generally maintained saturations from
88-95%.  She did have at least two desat's into the low 80s at
night, but responded within minutes to reassurance and haldol
without changing any pulmonary medications or oxygen.  On [**6-9**]
she had an episode of somlenence and increased confusion after
her Haldol had been increased to 2mg/dose and her NC O2 dropped
to 4L.  SHe was somlenent but arousable, and still oriented to
self  She recovered mental status quickly after a 50% venti mask
was placed, and was then seen by the MICU staff. She was
transferred again to the MICU at that point, and again was
diuresed aggressively with good result. Repeat TTE again showed
no patent foramen ovale/shunt. CTA was negative for PE.
.
She was transferred back to the floor on [**6-15**], where she
continued to required 6-8 L O2 and occasionally desat'd in
setting of anxiety. An echo [**6-19**] showed evidence of worsening
CHF (EF 30% now, was >55% in [**Month (only) **]), which would explain
continued increased oxygen requirement and SOB, with evidence of
pulmonary edema on CXR. In conjunction with the renal team, the
patient required almost daily HD or ultrafiltration to draw off
fluid. Attempts were made with medications to balance the need
for afterload reduction with supporting a blood pressure which
could tolerate volume loss through dialysis. This primarily
involved decreasing the patient's betablocker and verapamil dose
significantly, while maintaining isosorbide nitrate. The patient
was witnessed several times eating high salty foods, and being
non-compliant with the fluid restriction which complicated
attempts to manage her volume status. With aggressive HD, as
well as improved management of her anxiety and aggitation
(above) the patient gradually was weaned down to her baseline
requirement of 4L O2 on nasal cannula.
.
3) Anuric renal failure:  ATN likely from TCA/opiate overdose.
Outside hospital records revealed creatinine of 4.0 in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2166**].  On admission, anuric.  She was hyperkalemic, so initially
received kayxelate, calcium gluconate, insulin, and
bicarbonated.  No ECG changes.  Renal ultrasound negative for
obstruction.  Received aggressive hemodialysis sessions. There
was concern that tunneled dialysis line infected, but as she was
not rigoring and did not ever develop fever or hypotension
except when on dialysis, believed that filter on hemodialysis
machine may have caused adverse reaction.  Asaghi filter used on
[**5-22**] with good effect.
.
Management of the patient's volume status was complicated by
dietary noncompliance and aggitation. After requiring 2 MICU
transfers from the floor due to decreased oxygen saturation from
pulmonary edema, we were finally able to dialyze her
sufficiently to bring her back to baseline oxygen requirement.
We monitored her intake carefully and impressed upon her the
importance of dietary compliance. Adding neurontin to her
anxiety regimen helped calm her and she became more compliant
with our management strategy and was less likely to take off her
oxygen support.  Renal recommends performing a 24 hour urine
collection after one month to re-evaluate her renal status.
.
4) Cardiovascular:
--Ischemia: History of coronary artery disease.  As outpatient,
on aspirin but no beta blocker or ace-inhibitor.  ECG without
ischemic changes and initial cardiac enzymes negative. Continued
aspirin and added beta blocker.
--Pump: Evidence of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure
on admission.  As anuric, removed excess fluid with
hemodialysis.
--Rhythm: Remained in sinus rhythm.  Started on beta blockade.
--Hypertension:  Severely elevated blood pressures.  Started
amlodipine, metoprolol, and isorbide.  Goal blood pressure <170,
but due to longstanding hypertension, developed worsened mental
status when blood pressures less than 140.  Most likely due to
hypoperfusion.  In setting of hypotensive episodes during
dialysis, held antihypertensives on mornings of dialysis. Over
the course of hospitalization, we adjusted her bp medications
according to what was tolerated during dialysis. On discharge,
she is taking isosorbide mononitrate 30mg SR and toprol XL 100mg
q day.
.
5) GI:
On admission, apparent UGI bleeding.  Coffee grounds in NGT but
this was in setting of supratherapeutic INR. Subsequently
resolved status post reversal of INR.  Treated with IV (and then
po) protonix.  Her serial hematocrits remained stable.
Abdominal CT on [**5-1**] unremarkable. Diverticulosis was noted on
subsequent abdominal CT (as above).
.
6) Infectious Disease:
On admission, received levofloxacin, but then broadened to zosyn
and vancomycin for UTI.  Completed seven day course on [**5-5**].
Shortly after discontinuation of antibiotics, was transiently
febrile, so started meropenem and vancomycin on [**5-7**] for 3 day
course.
PICC line was placed and tunneled HD line placed on [**5-13**].
Febrile shortly after line placed (1/4 bottles with staph
coagulase negative), so started ten day course of vancomycin
that was completed on [**5-23**]. New PICC placed [**6-3**] for
antibiotics and question of infection.
On [**6-17**] ID was consulted for rising leukocytosis. Bacillus
species grew from [**6-19**] PICC blood cx, pt was started on cefepime
for bacteremia on [**6-20**] (initial culture result said GNR) and
PICC was d/c'd. Was discovered on [**6-23**] that bacillus likely was
a contaminant. Pt has been afebrile, but given persistently high
WBC, there was concern for infection or other etiology. [**6-18**]
culture from HD catheter had no growtn. C. Diff was negative.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**6-23**] given no organism isolated
and patient being afebrile. Subsequent culture from [**6-24**] showed
no growth to date. Can consider other cause of leukocytosis:
patient was not on systemic steroids so that is unlikely to be a
cause. Patient had mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung nodules,
which could suggest a malignant cause. Recommend working up
malignancy as outpatient given that patient is clinically stable
and would benefit from rehab placement.
.
7) Depression:
On outpatient lexapro.  Restarted during hospitalization, but
discontinued, per psychiatry, on [**5-22**].
.
8) Prophylaxis:
Patient on SC heparin (was on coumadin as outpatient, but
unclear reason), lansoprazole, bowel regimen, and thiamine.
.
9) Access:
PICC placed on [**5-13**], but removed [**5-22**].  Tunneled
hemodialysis catheter placed on [**5-13**].  PICC placed [**6-3**],
removed [**6-21**].
.
10) FEN:
Initially on tubefeeds.  Speech and swallow evaluation on [**5-18**] cleared patient for thin liquids and pureed solids.
Aspiration precautions. Eventually advanced to regular renal
diet. Occasionally was hyponatremic, thought due to excess free
water ingestion.  Was kept on fluid restriction 1L/day, with
varying effect as patient would sometimes obtain water/fluids
when the nurse was not looking.
.
11) Rash:
Patient noted to have morbilliform rash on trunk and flank on
evening of [**5-25**].  Most likely result of drug reaction.
Potentially vancomycin.  Started on hydrocortisone cream, sarna
lotion, and triamcinolone cream. Resolved. Pt also noted to have
intragluteal irritation with sattelite lesions, likely yeast
infection. Started on miconazole powder.
.
12) Code:
Full.  Confirmed with daughter. (in the past patient had said
she wanted to be DNR/DNI but then reversed this).
.
Communication:
Daughter, [**Name (NI) **] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 72819**].
.
Dispo:
To    . Has outpatient HD slot at [**Location (un) 37361**] for MWF.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2784**] presented to ED on [**8-10**] with nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis and distended abdomen.  She received an exploratory
laporatomy with lysis of adhesions for a small bowel obstruction
that was found to be the cause of her symptoms.  See Dr. [**Name (NI) 45689**] operative note for details.

Patient was intubated in the ED d/t inability to protect airway
and aspiration.  Bronchoscopy was performed after surgery and
she was found to have very little aspiration contents in her
lower airways. She was admitted to the ICU after surgery d/t
intubation and need for neosynephrine for BP control.  While in
the ICU she was successfull weaned off neosynephrine, and
required lopressor for tachycardia.  She had a drop in her Hct
to 24 and required one unit of blood.  She spiked a fever so was
given a treatment of cipro, vancomycin, and flagyl.  She was
successfuly extubated on POD 5 and experienced resp distress
that responded with Lasix.

She was transferred out of the unit on POD 6.  She had episodes
of non-responsiveness on the floor for which she received
several cardiac work-ups, psychiatry saw her and recommended
discontinuing her narcotic pain medicine and her
benzodiazepines.  She also had a work-up with Neurology which
included a 24 hour EEG, MRI and MRA of her head, and several lab
tests.  All of these were negative.

At the time of discharge, she was stable and no longer
experiencing these episodes of non-responsiveness. Neurology and
her primary team felt that she was able to return to home.
Physical therapy saw the patient and recommended home PT.

Neurosurg.


Final Report
INDICATION: 31-year-old with history of sudden onset worst
headache of life
with moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage on outside hospital CT.
Evaluate for
aneurysm.

No prior examinations available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head was performed, followed
by enhanced
CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] including multiplanar and
volume-rendered images.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is high attenuation focal hemorrhage
within the perimesencephalic and prepontine cisterns. No
extension of hemorrhage within the ventricles and no evidence of
hydrocephalus. No additional foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
High attenuation area along the left tentorium
likely represents a sagittal sinus (2:11). The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized
and aerated.

CTA: The visualized course of intracranial carotid and vertebral
arteries and their major branches are normal. There is no
evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.

IMPRESSION: Focal subarachnoid hemorrhage within the
perimesencephalic and
prepontine cisterns, without a definite aneurysm seen on the
CTA. Differential considerations included a perimesencephalic
(venous) hemorrhage or an occult aneurysm or AVM.

Findings were discussed with the neurosurgical team at the time
of the exam.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Provisional Findings Impression: DFDkq SUN [**2163-4-17**] 6:12 PM
Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the perimesencephalic and prepontine
cisterns, as well as in the sulci of both convexities. Normal
MRA of the neck. MRA of the head is slightly limited by motion,
but no aneurysms are identified.


Final Report
INDICATION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: Head CTA performed on [**2163-4-16**] and
conventional cerebral
angiogram performed on [**2163-4-16**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted and axial T1-weighted,
T2-weighted, FLAIR,
gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images of the head.
Three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA of the head. Dynamic
coronal VIBE imaging of the neck obtained during intravenous
gadolinium administration. Following intravenous gadolinium
administration, multiplanar T1-weighted images of the head were
obtained.

HEAD MRI: T1 isointense and T2 hypointense blood products are
seen in the
perimesencephalic and prepontine cisterns, corresponding to the
subarachnoid hemorrhage seen on the non-contrast portion of the
preceding head CTA. In addition, there is high signal in the
sulci on FLAIR images involving the right frontal, bilateral
parietal, and bilateral occipital lobes. This is consistent with
additional subarachnoid hemorrhage which is occult by CT. There
is no evidence of edema, infarction, mass or other pathologic
enhancement in the brain. There is no evidence of a meningeal
mass. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration.

NECK MRA: The cervical common carotid, internal carotid, and
vertebral
arteries appear normal. The distal cervical internal carotid
arteries measure at least 4 mm in diameter.

HEAD MRA: The study is slightly limited by artifacts. Flow is
seen in the
intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and their
major
branches, without evidence of stenoses or aneurysms.

IMPRESSION:

1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns as well as in
the cerebral sulci.

2. Normal neck MRA.

3. Unremarkable head MRA.

Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Decrease in saturations in a patient
with
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no comparison to
the prior
studies. There is a large opacity in the left lower lung most
likely
involving the left lower lobe and lingula. There is additional
opacity in the right lower lobe. The findings are concerning for
bilateral aspiration or multifocal pneumonia. Slight left
ventricle engorgement is present also may be projectional due to
the position of this film. No appreciable pleural effusion is
demonstrated.




Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted through the emergency room after transfer from
OSH for perimesencephalic hemorrhage after working out at gym.

Pt was placed on dilantin and nimodipine and and a-line was
placed. Systolic BP was controlled to less than 140. A cerebral
angiogram was done on [**2163-4-17**] which was negative for aneurysm.

A CXR was done on [**2163-4-18**] for low O2 sats and dark sputum.  The
findings were suggestive of pneumonia vs. aspiration however the
pt is afebrile without elevated WBC, so no antibiotics were
started at this time.  A blood gas was obtained that showed
poosr oxygenation.  This was discussed with the ICU attending
and CTA of the chest was then oobtained without evidence of PE.
Pt was supported on increasing amounts of O2 throughout the
night and on the am  of [**2163-4-19**] it was decided that he would
need ventilatory support.  Prior to intubation he was mentating
well and his neuro exm remianed stable.  Consent for HIV testing
was obtained and found to be negative.  Bronchoscopy for sputum
culture and or mucous plugging was performed. Lasix gtt was
started for ARDS treatment. He required mechanical ventilation
and was weaned to room air on [**4-20**] a CXR showed improved
bibasilar opacities prior to transfer to floor.

He was monitored on the surgical floor for 3 days and had a
repeat CTA which showed a
Normal CT of the head with no evidence of aneurysm formation.
Mild vasospasm
is noted at the distal basilar artery. He was cleared for
discharge he had no focal neurological deficits on discharge and
his headache was minimal. The patient felt comfortable managing
his diabetes as to his prior regiman. He was sent with a
prescription of Levaquin to finish his treatment of his
pneumonia.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
right flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right sided thoracocentesis (-2200 mL fluid)

History of Present Illness:
55 YO female with metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary
on C2D1 gemcitabine/irinotecan and with malignant pleural
effusions presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with severe R flank pain,
radiating to chest.   Patient reports pain was [**9-19**] in
severity.  She was otherwise asymptomatic, denying shortness of
breath or coughing at presentation.  She experienced R flank
pain previously for which she had applied a fentanyl patch with
adequate pain control.  Of note, she has known lytic bone
lesions to the R pelvis. She reports that she had not applied
the fentanyl patch to the R flank recently as pain control had
improved.
.
The patient's cancer initially presented as syncope and further
work-up revealed
pericardial/pleural effusion [**2181-5-10**].  The pleural fluid
revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma and the pericardial fluid a
well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient has had
3 recent admissions: on [**5-16**] for dyspnea and [**6-6**] and [**6-14**] for
dizziness/syncope.  On admission [**6-6**], the patient had
pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy with removal of
520 cc of bloody fluid. [**Month/Year (2) **] on [**6-4**] showed stable loculated
pericardial effusion. [**Month/Year (2) **] [**6-11**] (EF>55%) suggestive of
pericardial constriction, although unchanged in size since prior
admission.
.
During admission on [**6-14**], cardiology team saw the patient and
recommended trial of low dose beta blocker for rate control; a
pericardial window was not performed because the effusion was
determined to be stable and symptoms thought to be related to
dehydration and tachycardia.  Subsequent CT of the torso did not
reveal a primary source but did reveal bony lytic lesions in the
right ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastatic
disease. She also underwent an upper and lower endoscopy without
evidence of a  primary lesion. Considering pericardial and
pleural fluid pathology, a subtle gastric or pancreatico/biliary
tumor was suspected and the patient was started on
gemcitabine/irinotecan.  Her last dose of chemotherapy was
yesterday 8/2 per patient. Chemotherapy was begun on [**2181-6-15**].
.
Pt. presented to ED with tachycardia above baseline in 130s to
140s.  Patient has h/o resting tachycardia 115-120.
Electrocardiogram in the ED showed sinus tachycardia unchanged
from prior.  Radiography showed reaccumulation of pulmonary
edema and CT of the chest showed no acute changes.  A
therapeutic thoracentesis was performed of 2200 mL of dark
maroon right pleural fluid.  In addition, after the procedure,
the patient complained of increased shortness of breath
increased from baseline, patient's O2 saturation was in the 90s.
 The patient was administered Lasix (40 mg X1) in the ED with
subsequent improvement of respiratory function.  In ED patient
was administered vancomycin 1 g, ondasetron 2 mg twice, and 4
doses of morphine sulfate 4 mg. Patient was admitt-ed to ICU for
pain control and management of tachycardia in setting of pleural
effusions.

.
CXR ([**7-11**]):
IMPRESSION:  Increased size of now large right pleural effusion
and minimally increased now moderate left pleural effusion.
.
Chest CT ([**7-12**])
IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse peribronchovascular opacity with air bronchograms
involving the right middle and right lower lobes post
thoracentesis.  Given the rapid evolution of this process,
findings likely represent pulmonary edema. Pulmonary hemorrhage
or multifocal pneumonia is less likely.  Close interval
radiographic follow up recommended.
2.  Large left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.
3.  Minimal pericardial fluid.
4.  No pneumothorax or reaccumulation of the right pleural
effusion.

CXR ([**7-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
2.  Patchy opacities at the right lung base have cleared since
the prior
examination, likely representing pulmonary edema given its rapid
improvement;
mild persistent residual pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 55 y/o woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma of
unknown primary (likely discrete gastric or pancreaticobiliary
ca) admitted with tachycardia in the setting of malignant
pericardial effusions and uncontrolled pain.
.
# Malignant Effusion - The patient presented for outpatient
therapeutic thoracocentesis [**7-12**] (done for worsening SOB) with
removal of 2200 mL R sided fluid, followed by excruciating pain
at thoracotomy site. The dyspnea after her procedure was likely
a result of reexpansion edema, which was reflected on her chest
X-ray. She was initially treated in the intensive care unit with
oxygen therapy as well as IV Lasix and closely monitored. No
infectious etiology was identified. It was decided that
thoracentesis was not warranted as her pleural effusion was
significantly smaller after the procedure. Her respiratory
distress rapidly improved with diuresis and she was soon back to
baseline (requires home O2).
.
# Mucinous adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: The patient began
chemotherapy on [**2181-6-15**] with Gemzar and CPT-11 for metastatic
disease. She did not experience significant nausea during
hospitalization, but continued to have diarrhea related to her
chemotherapy which was treated with Lomotil.
.
# DVT/PE - She is s/p IVC filter placement on [**2181-5-30**] s/p DVT of
common femoral. She was continued on lovenox therapy.
.
# Pain - Patient had known lytic lesions, with high risk of
pathologic fracture. Bilateral hip xray on [**6-12**] demonstrated no
progression of known metastatic lesions. Orthopedics were
consulted on prior admisson and believe chemotherapy should
proceed prior to any radiation therapy to the hip. Also with
pain at site of thoracentesis. She was treated with home
fentanyl 25mcg patch for pain control, home lidocaine patch with
morphine for breakthrough pain

Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o female s/p liver transplant sent home on tube feeds who
returns with electrolyte derangements and an elevated Prograf
level.
On admission her sodium was noted to be 119 and she was started
on normal saline. In addition her creatinine was 1.6 which was
double her baseline value.
Over the next three days we continued to hydrate her and the
labs normalized significantly.
Tube feeds were reinstated.
She received counseling regarding the lasrge amount of free
water she was apparently drinking at home and medications were
reviewed as well to assure compliance especially with the
immunosuppression regimen.
She made an excellent recovery. The alk phos remained slightly
elevated but all other LFTs trended back or were normal. There
was discussion of further testing but it was determined at this
time that no other tests were required and she was sent home
still on tube feeds which are now being cycled as she did well
with the cycle trial initiated on this admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 85 year old male with history of diastolic heart
failure, copmlete heart block (s/p PPM [**6-7**]) ESRD on HDHD, h/o
MRSA bacteremia and thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to drug
reaction (PPI?) who presented from [**Hospital 100**] rehab with dyspnea.
Initially admitted to MICU with dyspnea and ? CO2 retention
requiring BiPAP. Pt was called out to the floor and did well for
several days.  He was then noted to be hypoxic at dialysis.  he
also underwent therapeutic thoracentesis on right side with good
relief.  The following morning, he was found to be somnolent
with myoclonic jerking.  ABG demonstrated 7.24/70/89 on 3 L/min.
 He was transferred back to the MICU for ? bipap.  He was noted
to be continually hypercarbic throughout his admission.

Pt's BPs continued to drop and he became unable to tolerate HD.
On the day prior to death, dialysis had to be stopped
prematurely (removed 2.2L) due to hypoxia and hypotension.  The
morning of his death, he was noted to be acutely hypoxic and
hypercarbic.  CXR revealed a collapsed left lung and increase in
right sided pleural effusion.  Discussed situation with family
and it was decided to not escalate care (had been decided upon
to make him DNR/DNI the night before).  Over the course of the
day, he became increasinly hypoxic, hypercarbic, acidotic, and
hypotensive.  He was pronounced deat at 17:25 on [**2133-8-25**].
Family was present and declined autopsy.
.
#.  Dyspnea:  Patient presented from rehab with acute dyspnea
and SOB with walking the day of admission likley from increasing
pleural effusions. Patient had been afebrile, without
leukocytosis, bandemia or cough making PNA very unlikely. Given
that CTX/Levaquin/Vanco started in the ED were D/Ced. Nephrology
was notified that the patient was admitted and Pt was sent to HD
for ultrafiltration on the day of transfer off of the MICU. CEs
were negative.

#. End Stage Renal Disease:  Patient on MWF HD treatments. Pt
continued HD as an in patient with removal of excess fluid.

#. C Diff colitis: Patient with (+) C diff tox x 3 during
admission in [**Month (only) 205**].  On Vanco at [**Hospital 100**] rehab until [**2133-8-24**].
Vanco 250mg PO QID was continued as an in patient.

#. Diastolic heart failure: Last ECHO [**2133-7-17**] with EF >55% and
mild mitral regurgitation. HD was done as above.

#. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is currently V-paced. We
continued outpatient amiodarone. Anticoagulation was held given
recent history of GI bleed.

#. Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-31**] to drug reaction one
month ago (PPI), currently at 61, down from 113 at last
admisstion. This suggests the possibility of MDS. Follow up with
a hematologist may be indicate in the future as an outpatient,
but since the remainder of his counts are WNL no H/O consult was
called.

History of Present Illness:
50 yo M Spanish speaking quadraplegic male with h/o ALS related
muscle weakness and worsening respiratory failure s/p multiple
hospital admissions for worsening weakness and FTT who presents
from home w/ continued chronic complaints of weakness,
difficulty eating, and intermittent shortness of breath. He
denies any new complaints in the last 5 months. He has had
intermittent SOB and intermittent O2 requirement at home. He has
had continued problems with eating.  Food gets stuck in his
throat when eating. He also complains of intermittent nausea.
He is wheelchair bound at home. He was last admitted
[**Date range (3) 50217**] for FTT, nausea and decreased po intake. At that
time, neurology recommended hospice care because of frequent
admissions for failure to thrive. It was also recommended that
he have acute rehab placement rather than a discharge home as it
seemed he needed more help at home. However patient refused and
was discharged home with VNS.
.
In ED, was febrile to 101. CXR and U/A were unremarkable. Blood
cultures were drawn. Given total of 3L NS in ED. He states he

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
Date: [**2187-8-29**]
Signed by [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **], CCC,SLP on [**2187-8-29**]  Affiliation:
[**Hospital1 18**]

EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, and pureed consistency barium were administered. He
refused to try a ground consistency. The exam was performed with
him seated fully upright at 90  w/the Passy-Muir Valve in place
over the trach.  Results follow:

SUMMARY:
Significant worsening of his oral and pharyngeal swallowing
ability s/p trach placement compared with his videoswallow on
[**2187-8-9**].  He is now having penetration with straw sips of thin
and nectar thick liquid and aspiration with straw sips of thin
liquid.  Aspiration is ""silent"" or without coughing.  He can not
clear the aspirated material with a cued cough. He has residue
in
his valleculae even when he alternates between bites of puree
and
sips of nectar.  He refused to try a ground consistency.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  It is not possible to eliminate the aspiration risk if he
    takes PO's.  However, we can reduce the risk.  Head position
    is critical to adequate airway protection.  He must be
    propped up with his head at 90 to fully protect his airway,
    and the Passy-Muir speaking valve must be in place over the
    trach.  He reported difficulty breathing by with the PMV on

    by the end of our study despite 02 sats of 98%.  His
    respiratory rate was 31 by the end of the exam and it
    dropped back to 24 after removal of the PMV.

2.  The safest way to feed him with the least aspiration risk:
    A.  Sit fully upright w/head propped forward at 90
    B.  Cup sips of nectar thick liquid
    C.  Alternated with bites of pureed foods
    D.  Only when wearing the PMV
    e.  Only after thorough suctioning prior to any PO's

3.  If he is made CMO and he wants water, we would suggest
    Thorough suctioning & complete oral care w/mouthwash first
    then cup sips of ice water only when fullu upright w/PMV on

4.  If he is unable to wear the PMV, we should repeat the
    videoswallow without it to see if he is still safe to take
    PO's without the PMV.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse
and
the medical team.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with
1) respiratory failure, 2) nutritional failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with
1) respiratory failure, 2) nutritional failure.

PROCEDURE:
1.  Tracheostomy.
2.  Gastrostomy.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the
operating theater and his neck, chest and abdomen were
prepared with Betadine and draped sterilely. The head was
positioned extended with shoulder roll placed. The
tracheostomy incision was performed first with the remainder
of the field isolated with an over drape.

A vertical midline incision was formed in the neck between
the cricoid and the sternal notch. This was infiltrated with
1% lidocaine with epinephrine for improved hemostasis. The
wound was taken down in the midline using cautery taking care
to remain in the raphae. The anterior surface of the trachea
was crossed at the first interspace by the thyroid isthmus.
The isthmus was therefore isolated and suture ligated
bilaterally with #2-0 silk. It was then divided and the
second and third tracheal rings exposed widely by dissection
of the thyroid off of the trachea. At this time, stay sutures
were placed into the trachea in the midline at the first and
third rings with 3-0 Prolene. A trap door was scored with
cautery and then the trachea was entered sharply with the
endotracheal balloon deflated. The transverse incision at the
second ring was used to visualize the endotracheal tube,
which was then passed distally and further work was done with
airway control above the balloon until we were ready for the
exchange. At this time the remainder of the flap was cut
using [**Hospital1 **] scissors and hemostasis was obtained using cautery
on the tracheal mucosa. At this time, a prelubricated #8
Shiley tracheostomy was brought onto the field. The
endotracheal tube was withdrawn under direct vision to above
the tracheotomy site and the tracheostomy placed into the
trachea uneventfully. CO2 return was assured as was
ventilation. The tracheostomy was sutured in place with 0
silk and then secured with umbilical tapes. The inferior
portion of the tracheostomy wound was closed slightly with a
single #3-0 nylon. The superior stay suture was removed. The
inferior stay in the flap was left in place and secured with
a Tegaderm for access should there be an inadvertant removal.
Procedure was terminated. Estimated blood loss was less than
5 cc.

At this time, the neck wound was covered. The over drape was
removed and attention was turned to the abdomen.

A 6 to 8 cm incision was fashioned in the midline. The skin
was incised sharply. Subcutaneous tissues were divided with
the [**Last Name (un) 4161**] and traction. The linea [**Female First Name (un) **] was incised with
cautery and the calciform ligament was visualized. This was
swept to the right and the peritoneum was entered along the
left margin of the falciform. The abdominal contents were
visualized. The colon was identified clearly and swept
inferiorly. The stomach was grasped with long Babcocks in
left upper quadrant and delivered into the wound. At this
time, 2 Babcocks were placed to hold the stomach up in the
wound. Concentric 2-0 silk pursestring sutures were placed
into the anterior wall of the stomach at the junction
approximately of the antrum and the body. At this time [**Last Name (un) **]
cautery was used to enter the stomach through the
pursestrings. This wound was dilated slightly with a clamp
and a #24 Malecot catheter was passed into the stomach. At
this time, the pursestrings were tied and the catheter was
withdrawn through the abdominal wall approximately 6 cm to
the left of the midline and 2 fingerbreadths below the costal
margin. This was done by incising the skin generously and
passing a Sarot clamp, antegrade into the abdomen and
withdrawing the end of the Malecot catheter. At this time,
the Malecot was withdrawn to bring the stomach snuggly up
against the anterior abdominal wall. Just prior to
withdrawing the catheter the final 2 cm, a 3-0 silk suture
was placed into the posterior rectus sheath and the stomach
to tack the stomach up to the abdominal wall. This was tied
as the Malecot was withdrawn to have the stomach flushed with
the posterior sheath. At this time, the Malecot catheter was
secured in place on the skin with a #2-0 nylon.

The midline at this time was irrigated with copious normal
saline and closed with a running #0 PDS suture. Subcutaneous
tissues were once more irrigated and hemostasis was assured.
The skin was closed with staples. Dry sterile dressings were
applied. The gastrostomy tube was placed to gravity drainage
and will be maintained that way for 24 hours at which point
the patient can be fed. Estimated blood loss was less than 5
cc. Patient tolerated both procedures without incident.

IVC FILTER PLACEMENT

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained
from the
[**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy, the patient was placed supine on the
angiographic table.  Right groin was prepped and draped in
standard sterile fashion.  Using sterile technique, local
anesthesia and ultrasound guidance, the right common femoral
vein was accessed and a vascular sheath for the delivery system
of IVC filter was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The
venogram was then performed demonstrating patent inferior vena
cava, and the level of renal veins was identified to be at L1
vertebral body.  Based on radiologic findings, it was decided
that the patient would benefit from placement of an IVC filter.
The tip of the sheath was positioned in the infrarenal IVC at
the level of L1 under fluoroscopic guidance.  The filter was
then advanced into the sheath and placed into the infrarenal
portion of the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The sheath was
then removed and hemostasis was achieved after 10 minutes of
manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
There were no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of intraluminal thrombus in the right common
femoral vein,
right iliac and IVC veins.
2.  IVC filter placed into infrarenal location.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50yo man w/ rapidly progressing ALS who is
status post tracheostomy, PEG, IVC filter placement with course
complicated by peptic ulcer cauterization, and antibiotic
treatment for S. aureus and B. fragilis bacteremia.
.
#Respiratory failure:
The pt initially presented from home [**2187-8-3**] w/ chronic
complaints of weakness, difficulty eating, and intermittent
shortness of breath. At the time on the medical floor he had
worsening secretions in his oropharynx requiring nasotracheal
and oropharyngeal secretions with distress resulting in
hypertension and tachycardia. A Scopolamine patch was placed and
pt was admitted to the MICU on [**2187-8-8**] for more intensive
monitoring and nursing care. He subsequently recovered, was
extubated, and was called out to the floor on [**2187-8-10**].
.
The patient's respiratory status remained stable until late
night on [**8-21**]. The pt had a sudden onset of SOB with
diaphoresis, followed by hypotension. The MICU team was called.
The pt's vitals at midnight were T 96.1, BP 154/80, HR 100, RR
26, O2 83% on 2L NC. At this point the pt was placed on NRB.
During this period the pt's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding his
code status. He had been DNI only until the day prior when the
pt and his family decided to allow for intubation for scheduled
PEG placement [**8-22**]. Given this reversal of code status,
clarification was warranted. Initially the pt's wife/hcp could
not be reached. At 12:15 am the pt's vitals were BP 86/66, HR
70, RR 16. ABG was done and showed 7.04/121/138. The pt was
placed on peripheral dopamine and given an amp of HCO3. A CXR
was performed and did not show any acute pulmonary process. An
EKG was without acute changes. The pt's wife was reached and
affirmed that the pt was to be full code. The pt was intubated
at around 12:30 am for hypercarbic respiratory failure. His
dopamine was discontinued as his pressure stabilized. He was
further supported hemodynamically with IVF boluses (1.5 L) prior
to arriving to the ICU. In ICU a R IJ TLC was placed and pt was
bolused to maintain pressures.
.
In the ICU, pt was stable and multiple attempts to wean him for
extubation, but he was unable to maintain ventilatory status on
his own. After much discussion with the family in conjunction
with the palliative care team, the decision was made to place
tracheostomy and gastric tube.  After trach placement, attempts
were made to place him on trach collar which he was only able to
tolerate for short periods. He was fitted for a Passy-Muir Valve
to allow him to speak with the trach. He has some endotracheal
secretions for which he is treated with glycopyrrolate.  He is
currently vented with Vt 600 cc Respiratory rate: 14 PEEP: 5
cm/h2o FIO2: 40 % which he tolerates well.
.
#GI bleed: He was initially guaiac negative during his
hospitalization. Pt's hematocrit dropped to 17 on [**2187-9-9**]. A
abdominal CT was performed that showed no RP bleed but
high-density material in the stomach, concerning for gastric
hemorrhage.  We attempted to draw a residual through his PEG,
but it was obstructed, unable to infuse or withdraw. Hemolysis
labs were not revealing. His stools then became guaiac positive
during this time period. GI was consulted and performed an EGD
which showed an ulceration at the PEG tube site that was
cauterized. Surgery was consulted to reassess the PEG tube, and
it was cleared with sodium bicarbonate tablet solution.  He was
maintained on [**Hospital1 **] PPI. Anticoagulation was stopped and a
retrievable IVC filter was placed on [**2187-9-11**]. His Hct was
subsequently stable. He received a total of 5U PRBC for this
bleed. Throughout hospitalization PEG worked without difficulty.
.
#Tachycardia: Pt was tachycardic throughout stay. TSH wnl. Pain
and anxiety were adressed with psych consult and starting
mirtazapine in addition to his home sertraline. He denied any
pain that might be contributing. He had an echocardiogram which
showed hyperdynamic LV function. In discussion with cardiology,
we believe that his tachycardia may result from autonomic
instability resulting from his ALS. During the remainder of his
hospitalization, his heart rate was controlled with low-dose
metoprolol.
.
#Bacteremia: Pt has been afebrile. WBC stable. Follow-up
cultures are negative to date.  Completed 14-day course of
vancomycin for coag-negative S. aureus, levofloxacin and
metronidazole for B. fragilis.
.
#h/o DVT: Pt had wafarin and heparin doses adjusted depending on
his antibiotic regimen and OR status. He was maintained on low
dose wafarin while on levofloxacin and metronidazole. All
anticoagulation was stopped on [**2187-9-9**] with his GI bleed. A
retrievable IVC filter was placed on [**2187-9-11**].
.
#Elevated troponin: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a troponin leak at the time of
intubation peaking at 1.4. He had no EKG changes without a bump
in his CK, so he likely had a reversible ischemic event in the
context of sepsis, tachycardia, and intubation.  He denied any
CP at the time. His troponins trended down thereafter.
.
#ARF: During this hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an acute
increase in his creatinine despite good UO. Renal U/S ([**2187-8-27**])
was negative for hydronephrosis. His UA showed urine
eosinophils. His creatinine increase corresponded to his
starting Zosyn, so Zosyn was stopped with slow resolution of his
creatinine to baseline.
.
#Disposition: Mr. [**Known lastname 50219**] health is stable and transferred to
Radius [**Hospital 7755**] Hospital.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old man with
CAD, PVD who had difficulty speaking after left carotid
endarterectomy in [**2133-2-16**].  The patient has had bilateral
carotid stenosis.  On [**2-21**] while he was sitting in a chair he
developed sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness,
followed by right arm and leg weakness.  He also had
difficulty speaking.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
and underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [**2-26**] and
afterwards began having severe left sided headache behind his
left eye that lasted for hours and was constant.
Nevertheless, he visited [**Hospital3 **] for continued
headaches and nausea and vomiting.  During one of those
visits he had a contortion of his right face and bilateral
arm jerking and was started on Dilantin with presumptive
diagnosis of seizures.  He has recovered from that event when
was again discharged home.  On [**3-13**] he again presented with
persistent headaches, confusion and inability to talk.  He
had difficulty getting his words out.  He had a head CT at
[**Hospital3 **] which showed a linear hyperintense region
in the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in
the left posterior parietal lobes.  At that time he was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**].  MRI
of his head showed left MCA/ACA and left MCA/PCA watershed
strokes with acute and subacute hemorrhage conversions.  It
was thought at that time that he had extended his watershed
infarcts after carotid endarterectomy leading to a carotid
hyperperfusion syndrome.  The patient was discharged from the
neurologic Intensive Care Unit to a rehab facility.  On
Thursday, [**2133-3-26**], patient's wife noticed erythema on
patient's face.  On [**3-27**] the visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11282**] of
a rash on his arms as well.  The patient was noted to be
febrile and was admitted to the [**Company 191**] Firm.  In the EW,
patient's Dilantin was discontinued and he was given Tegretol
instead.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Left CEA in [**2133-2-16**].  2) CVA in
[**2133-2-16**].  3) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  4)  CAD.  5)
PVD.  6) Hypercholesterolemia.  7) History of amaurosis
fugax.  8) Status post lymph node removal.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Dilantin
200 mg po tid, Prilosec 40 mg po q day, Lipitor, Ambien.

ALLERGIES:  Iodine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 3146**], tobacco since
[**2126**], one pint of alcohol per day.  The patient works as a
carpenter.

FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.3, pulse
86, blood pressure 94/65, respiratory rate 18, saturations
96% on room air.  In general, alert, oriented times three, no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light, mucus membranes moist, oropharynx clear.
No lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm,
no murmurs.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no cyanosis, erythema, edema.  Neuro,
cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Skin red maculopapular
blanching erythema on face, torso and extremities, sparing
the soles.  Bilateral lower extremity petechiae, no
significant oral lesions noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Derm:  Over the course of patient's stay on [**Company 191**] Firm,
patient had rigors and fevers of up to 101 degree.  The
patient was initially continued on Tegretol.  The patient had
worsening rash throughout his torso with lip swelling and
tongue swelling.  The patient did not experience any
respiratory difficulties throughout the course of his stay on
the [**Company 191**] service.  A derm consult was obtained.  The
dermatology team recommended discontinuing Tegretol.  Their
thought was that the patient's symptoms were secondary to his
hypersensitivity to Dilantin.  The patient was treated
symptomatically with IV fluids, Zantac, Benadryl and Synalar
cream.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit overnight for observation given risk of respiratory
distress.  [**Hospital **] Medical Intensive Care Unit stay was
uneventful.  Skin biopsy was also consistent with
hypersensitivity reaction.  Over the course of patient's stay
in the hospital, patient's rash started to improve with
decreasing erythema and edema.

2.  Neuro:  Patient was seen by neurology service.  They
recommended stopping all anti-epileptic medications since
they thought that his symptoms were likely secondary to
carotid reperfusion syndrome and anti-seizure medications are
not necessarily beneficial under these circumstances.

3.  GI:  Patient's LFTs were slightly elevated during his
admission.  The patient's Lipitor was held due to increased
LFTs.  His increased LFTs were likely secondary to Dilantin.
Patient to follow-up with his PCP to make sure LFTs are
trending down and before restarting Lipitor.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Dilantin hypersensitivity reaction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg po bid, Zantac 150 mg
po bid, Synalar ointment, Eucerin cream.  Discharged to home.
patient to follow-up with PCP next week as well as with
dermatology.  Patient's PCP to assess blood pressure before
restarting Atenolol.

[**2183-9-4**] Chest CT:CT CHEST
REASON FOR EXAM: Characterize diffuse opacities described in
prior chest
x-ray from [**8-31**] and [**9-1**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT through the chest was acquired
without IV
contrast. 5-, 1.25-mm collimation images, sagittal and coronal
reformations were provided and reviewed.

FINDINGS: The airways are patent to the segmental level. There
is increase in number and size of mediastinal lymph nodes
located in all stations. They measure up to 8 mm in the
prevascular station, 10 mm in the upper pretracheal station, in
the left lower paratracheal station measuring 10 mm, precarinal
station up to 12 mm. Evaluation of hilar lymph nodes is limited
due to the lack of IV contrast. Some of the lymph nodes are
calcified in the left hilum and the left paraesophageal station.
There is mild cardiomegaly. There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-to-moderate calcifications are in the LAD and circumflex
coronary arteries. Cardiac size is normal.

Large right and moderate left pleural effusions are layering and

nonhemorrhagic, associated with adjacent areas of atelectasis. A
noncalcified lung nodule in the right lower lobe measures 5 mm
(4, 105). Large multiple areas of ground glass opacity
associated with smooth interlobular septal thickening are
present in the upper lobes bilaterally, right greater than left.
The upper abdomen is unremarkable. There are no bone findings of
malignancy

IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural
effusions.
5-mm right lower lobe lung nodule. Followup in one year is
recommended.
Cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Acute renal failure: Developed after transfer from OSH,
likely ATN secondary to contrast load on [**2183-8-30**] + SIRS +
hypotension in the ICU overnight the evening of [**2183-8-31**]. FENa
5%, lytes remained stable. Patient was given continuous IV
fluids and developed post-ATN diuresis complicated by one
episode of hypernatremia. Her creatinine slowly improved and was
1.5 at the time of discharge.
.
2) ?Multifocal pneumonia: Could very well have represented ARDS,
but given fevers, persistent oxygen requirement and concerning
CT at OSH patient was treated with Vanc/Zosyn. Blood cultures
were sent at the OSH and remained negative. Patient was weaned
off of oxygen and remained stable on room air.
.
3) Pancreatitis: Lipase significantly decreased by the time of
transfer; patient was never nauseous or with abdominal pain.
ERCP was not felt to be indicated and she was followed
clinically as her diet was advanced. A repeat MRCP performed on
[**2183-9-11**] was normal.
.
4) Intermittent fevers: Patient had continued low-grade fevers
throughout her hospital stay. CXR, UA, blood cultures, and MRCP
were unrevealing. Infectious disease was consulted and
suggested that a drug reaction to penicillin be considered as
part of the differential diagnosis, but also recommended Hep C,
Hep B, RPR, and HIV as initial work up. These were obtained and
returned negative prior to the patient's discharge except for
the Hepatitis C serologies which are still pending. As the
workup was in progress, the patient's fever curve decreased and
she subsequently became afebrile 3 days prior to her discharge.
Because the patient deffervesced, the infectious disease service
did not feel that an echocardiogram, blood smears for parasites,
or other serologies needed to be pursued as an inpatient. The
service made two other recommendations:
A) a shorter follow up interval for her small lung nodule than
12 months due to her history of fever.
B) That after her acute illness subsided to consider checking
crp, esr and nuclear medicine studies if all else was negative;
and to also consider checking anaplasma/ehrlichia serologies,
anca, [**Doctor First Name **], spep/upep and consider Rheumatological evaluation +/-
Oncology evaluation.
.
5) Maculo papular rash: The patient developed a rash across her
abdomen, back and all 4 extremities 4 days prior to her
discharge. The rash was thought to be part of a possible drug
reaction to penicillins although the timing was after she had
discontinued her zosyn. It was treated with benedryl and sarna
and almost completely resolved by the time of discharge.
.
6) Increased mediastinal lymphadenpathy and 5mm lung nodule on
CT as noted above -  requires follow-up in [**4-30**] months.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred here from an outside hospital for
evaluation of pancreatitis and pneumonia. Your pancreatitis
improved without further intervention. Your pneumonia was
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. Your hospital course
was complicated by acute renal failure, which improved with IV
fluids. You had low-grade fevers until the end of your hospital
stay without a clear cause. You were  seen in consultation by
our Infectious Disease specialists who recommended several blood
tests for look for a possible infection that may be causing your
fevers. All of these tests were negative, including Hepatitis B,
HIV, and an RPR test. You have a pending test for Hepatitis C
that you can check at your follow up appointment. The infectious
disease doctors recommended that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] get an echocardiogram of
your heart, but your fevers have gone away before this test
could be scheduled in the hospital. You should follow up with
your primary physician to consider whether an echocardiogram
should be done as an outpatient. A small lung nodule was seen on
your CT scan of your lungs that will need to be followed up with
your primary physician.

There have been no changes to your home medications.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your primary care doctor within one week
of discharge.

Prebypass
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is a PFO
with bidirectional flow.There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex,
apical and midportions of the inferior, inferoseptal and septal
walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results on [**2153-2-13**] at 0945am

Patient became acutely ischemic when global LVEF was < 20% and
emergent cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm. Patient is receiving infusions of
phenylephrine, epinephrine and milrinone. LVEF= 35%. Immediately
post bypass the mitral regurgitation was severe. A few minutes
later the mitral regurgitation was 2+. Aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital and underwent preoperative
work up.  On [**2153-2-13**] he was brought to the operating room and
underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  See operative
report for further details.  He received vancomycin for
perioperative antibiotics.  Post operatively he was transferred
to the intensive care unit for post operative management. He
awoke neurologically intact, was weaned form the ventilator and
extubated. He was started on betablockers, statin therapy and
diuresed toward his pre-operative weight with intermittant
boluses of IV lasix. His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires
were removed per protocol. The patient developed
thrombocytopenia with a platelet count down to 107,000, from
309,000.  HIT was sent and would return negative.  He did
develop acute renal failure with a creatinine rise to 2.7 (from
1.1) and oliguria.  Diuresis was held and creatinine would begin
to trend back down.  Oliguria resolved and the patient had
adequate urine output prior to discharge.  Cardiac rhythm became
atrial fibrillation and the patient was treated with amiodarone
and anti-coagulation was initiated with coumadin.  The patient
subsequently developed ventricular bigeminy and was returned to
the CVICU.  Lidocaine drip was started.  This would resolve and
the patient returned to the step-down unit.  He developed
erythema and tenderness around the left SVG harvest site and was
started on po keflex x7days. He was evaluated and treated by
physical therapy and cleared for discharge to home on POD#11 by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

Chief Complaint:
infected PPM

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lead and pacemaker extraction
Temporary pacer
Pacer insertion left chest


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 82-yo man with complete heart block s/p dual
chamber [**Company **] pacemaker [**10/2101**] with RV lead revision [**2-/2112**]
and recent device infection in [**1-/2113**], hypertension,
dyslipidemia, GERD, and BPH, who presented today with continued
device infection for lead and device extraction. The procedure
was prolonged due to significant fibrosis of the pacer leads,
and he was noted to have purulent material that was extracted
and sent to the microbiology lab for analysis. Given his history
of complete heart block and hypotension with his ventricular
escape rhythm, a temporary screw-in external pacemaker was
placed in the right IJ. Intra-operative TEE was unremarkable,
but he did require Neosynephrine in the OR for hypotension that
was thought to be due to the prolonged anesthesia. Given the
significant infection, the wound was left open, to close by
secondary intention, with plan to treat with IV antibiotics over
the weekend and re-implant a pacemaker next week.
.
With regards to the recent device infection in [**2113-1-12**],
this was initially treated with IV vancomycin, but that was
discontinued due to development of fever and rash. He was
instead treated with a full course of IV linezolid. The site was
noted to have significantly improved, and he was seen in [**Hospital **]
clinic at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] at which point the site was
considered to be healed. Per the patient, the site was stable
for over 3 months, but he then developed a new area of erythema
over the left lateral aspect of the pocket, with blistering. He
was seen for this complaint in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2113-6-7**]. He denies
any fevers or chills but has been experiencing pain at the
pacemaker site with his usual activity. His WBC was 5.1 with a
normal differential on [**2113-6-12**], and he was admitted today for
lead and device extraction for continued infection versus new
pocket site infection.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was hypotensive with SBP in
the 60s. He received a 200cc NS IVF bolus with improvement to
the 90s. He complains of left-sided chest pain as well as pain
and tingling in his fingers bilaterally, left worse than right.
There is no weakness or numbness of the hands. The pains are
intermittent. ECG showed V-pacing at 60 bpm. STAT TTE showed no
obvious effusion or depressed ventricular function, and STAT CXR
was also unremarkable. His external pacemaker rate was increased
from 60 to 80 bpm. IV Linezolid was started for possible
septicemia. He did not require any further IVF or vasopressor
support.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Blood Cx [**6-16**] and [**6-17**] NGTD

ECHO [**6-15**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 - 40 %). The
right ventricle displays mild to m oderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
leaflets and pulmonic leaflets are not well seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.

After lead extraction, there were no significant changes and no
signs of an enlarging pericardial effusion.

ECHO [**6-15**]
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is very small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no pericardial
effusion.

CXR: [**2113-6-20**]
Since yesterday, right-sided dual-chamber pacemaker still ends
in expected
position. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural
effusion
increased, still tiny. Hyperinflation is unchanged. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. There is no other change.

ECG:
Baseline artifact. Sinus or atrial paced or ventricular paced
rhythm.
Since the previous tracing of [**2113-1-23**] atrial pacing is probably
new at a faster
rate.


Brief Hospital Course:
82-yo man with complete heart block s/p dual chamber pacemaker
with RV lead revision and recent device infection who presented
with continued device infection for lead and device extraction,
found to have significant infection of the pacer pocket and lead
fibrosis, now s/p external temporary pacemaker placement and
awaiting treatment with IV antibiotics prior to re-implantation
of permanent pacemaker.
.
# Infected pacemaker - He was seen for this complaint in [**Hospital **]
clinic on [**2113-6-7**]. He denies any fevers or chills but has been
experiencing pain at the pacemaker site with his usual activity.
His WBC was 5.1 with a normal differential on [**2113-6-12**], and he was
admitted on [**6-15**] for lead and device extraction. On arrival to
the CCU, the patient was hypotensive with SBP in the 60s. He
received a 200cc NS IVF bolus with improvement to the 90s. He
complained of left-sided chest pain as well as pain and tingling
in his fingers bilaterally, left worse than right. There is no
weakness or numbness of the hands. The pains are intermittent.
ECG showed V-pacing at 60 bpm. STAT TTE showed no obvious
effusion or depressed ventricular function, CXR was also
unremarkable. His external pacemaker rate was increased from 60
to 80 bpm. He was started on IV Linezolid. He did not require
any further IVF or vasopressor support.  The patient underwent
pacer and lead extraction on [**2113-6-15**] without complication. A
temporary pacer was also placed after removal.  The patient
remained stable and blood cx were NGTD.  He was seen by ID who
recommended 2 weeks of linezolid from pacer extraction [**2113-6-15**].
The patient had a new pacemaker placed on [**2113-6-19**] without
complication.  CXR showed no PTX and leads in proper position.
His wound culture eventually grew coag-neg staph.  The patient
will have both ID and EP follow-up with weekly labs.   The
patient remained afebrile and pacemaker was working properly.

# complete heart block (rhythm) - See above for management of
pacemaker. The patient had his lead and pacer extracted on
[**2113-6-15**]. A temporary external pacemaker in right IJ was placed.
He was monitored on tele. A new pacemaker was placed on [**2113-6-19**]
without complication.

# coronaries - The patient has no known CAD or findings of CAD
on ECG.  He remained chest pain free. He was continued on home
ASA.
.
# pump - The patient had an intra-op EF 35-40% with moderate
global LV hypokinesis. He remained clinically euvolemic.

# hypertension - The patient's anti-hypertensives were intially
held secondary to his hypotension.  Once his pressures had
stabilzed he was restarted on lisinopril 10mg and home
metoprolol succinate 12.5mg at the time of discharge.

# dyslipidemia - stable, continued home statin
.
# diabetes - stable, continued home Actos and ISS. He was also
continued on a diabetic diet.

# GERD - stable, continued home H2B

# BPH - His flomax was initally held secondary to hypotension,
but restarted once stable.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Induction of Hemodialysis
Plasmapheresis
Kidney Transplant [**2155-4-17**]
[**2155-5-1**] small bowel obstruction, ex lap with LOA


History of Present Illness:
A 65 year-old woman with history of end-stage renal disease
scheduled for LRRT [**2155-4-8**] presenting with uremic symptoms. She
was admitted for induction of hemodialysis to prevent dialysis
disequilibrium after receiving her transplant.
.
In the ED, her vital signs were 98.3, 118/62, 90, 13, and 98%
RA.  She received zofran 4 mg IV x1 and was sent directly to
dialysis before arrival to the floor. At dialysis she had 0.5 kg
removed via a right tunnelled line that had been placed one week
ago for plasmapheresis (she underwent plasmaphereis to remove
antibodies against daughter's antigens-- daughter will provide
the donor kidney).

Upon arrival to the floor from HD, she feels much better. She
denies nausea or vomiting, and is looking forward to eating
dinner. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or
lightheadedness. ROS is positive for vertigo, worse with sitting
and standing, that she says has been ongoing for three months.
She says she was seen by ENT yesterday for evaluation of the
vertigo and was prescribed acyclovir for ?Zoster infection,
which she has not yet started. However, it appears the vertigo
developed several weeks before she started immunosuppressants
(which she started one week ago). She denies facial rash or
burning. ROS otherwise unremarkable.

Past Medical History:
- End-stage renal disease, likely due to lithium toxicity
- Questionable history of temporal arteritis versus polymyalgia
rheumatica on prednisone
- Severe bipolar disorder, controlled with Lamictal and Celexa
- Hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia related to lithium
- Vertigo, on meclizine
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Cholecystectomy in [**2144**]

Social History:
She used to work as secretary at the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] company, and
is retired since [**2146-4-9**]. She lives with her son and she has
four children. The patient denies any history of tobacco
smoking, alcohol abuse, or drug use.

Family History:
Her grandfather and one of her uncles suffered from Bright
disease. Her mother's sister died of breast cancer. Her uncle
had a history of melanoma, which was metastatic. Her father died
at age of 84 from congestive heart failure. Her mother died from
a severe stroke.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 65 year-old woman with history of ESRD scheduled for LRRT
[**2155-4-8**] presenting with nausea and vomiting and emergent
induction of hemodialysis. She underwent HD without complication
and plasmapheresis to prevent transplant rejection. She received
Rituximab. Her transplant was postponed to 4/9/9 because it
seemed that she still had positive antibodies against her
daughters kidney, this however, turned out to be not
significant. She was continued on her immunosuppressant regimen
(cellcept/tacrolimus. She had an episode of fevers/chills and
was temporarily on vanc/zosyn, however, the sxs resumed and her
cultures remained negative.

On  [**2155-4-17**] she underwent living related renal transplant from
her daughter. It was noted that she had a very thin posterior
fascia and peritoneum. Therefore, the
kidney was ultimately intraperitoneal in the retroperitoneal
space. The iliac vessels were soft without significant plaque.
The donor kidney had a single renal artery with an early
bifurcation and a single renal vein and a single ureter. The
kidney pinked up and produced urine. Please refer to operative
note. Postop, she was sent to the SICU due to volume overload
and respiratory difficulty. Respiratory function improved. Urine
output was excellent.

She received plasmapheresis postop transplant for HLA
desensitization related to transplant for 3 more treatments
postop for a total of none treatments.  A total of 3 doses of
ATG were given postop op. Solumedrol was tapered. Prograf was
titrated to trough levels. Cellcept continued at 1 gram [**Hospital1 **].
Creatinine dropped to 0.6. Luminex was sent on [**4-22**]. Urine
output average 1.5 liters per day. BP was elevated to
180's/120s. Lopressor was uptitrated and Norvasc was started. BP
improved. Diet was advanced and tolerated. PT worked with her
and recommended a walker.

On postop day 4, she developed ecchymosis around incision with
extension to right hip and lower abdomen. She also started to
drain sero-sanguinous fluid from her incision.

On [**2155-4-21**], she fell in the bathroom after standing up from the
toilet striking her nose against the wall. She denied passing
out. She was alert and oriented. A stat head CT was done showing
no acute intracranial process. A sinus/[**Last Name (un) **]/max CT showed
questionable nondisplaced fracture of the nasal bone. She
developed bruising over her nose with mild-mod swelling. A
developed a frontal headache that was treated with tylenol and
iv pain medication.

She developed dizziness prompting a neurology consult on [**4-28**].
It was felt that this was not a vestibular process, but rather
findings were suggestive of cervical spondylosis with myelopathy
with dorsal column involvement, with impaired functional
position sensation given history of reduced range of motion of
the neck, upper motor neuron weakness at the deltoids, triceps,
and iliopsoas, reduced vibratory sensation, and brisk reflexes
throughout.  Recommendations were for the her to wear a soft
cervical collar at all times for two weeks (if tolerated), then
at least at nightwhile sleeping thereafter.

Around postop day 6, her abdomen appeared distended and she
complained of nausea. The incision started to oozed at the
inferior edge. This was opened at the inferior edge. She
continued to have diffuse bruising aroun the RLQ. She developed
nausea with vomiting that appeared bilious. LFTs increased (alt
144, ast 148, alk phos 296, t.bili 6.8). LFTs were monitored
daily with continued rise. Hepatitis screening was done. This
was negative for HAV, HBsAG, HCV. Hemolysis workup was negative.
Liver duplex was done twice noting a small amount of perihepatic
fluid, no intra or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation. GGT was
elevated suggestive of liver/biliary source of increased alk
phos that rose to 500 with t.bili of 4.9.

 A KUB was done showing distended loops of small bowel. An NG
tube was place. Abd CT ([**4-25**])revealed distended small bowel with
decompressed distal small bowel and relatively decompressed
colon consistent with small bowel obstruction. There was a
transition point in RLQ. There was no evidence of perforation.
Normal liver without biliary abnormalities. Small amount of
perihepatic ascites. She was kept NPO. LFTs fluctuated daily.
She received IV hydration. She started to have flatus and bowel
movements. Bowel movements increased in frequency.  On [**4-29**], the
NG tube was removed. KUB revealed persistenly dilated loops of
small bowel and air fluid levels. KUBs continued to show
distended loops with air fluid levels despite BMs.

Nausea/vomiting and diarrhea continued. The NG was replaced.
LFTs improved. On [**5-1**], she was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.
Postop diagnosis was small bowel obstruction. A wound vac was
applied to the lower portion of the incision that was opened.
Despite the vac, the wound continued to drain serous fluid. The
wound vac was discontinued and a gauze dressing was applied.
Drainage stopped and a topical dry gauze dressing was applied as
the wound healed.

She remained npo with an NG tube in place. Given prolonged npo
status, TPN was started. She developed watery diarrhea. Stool
cultures were negative. A CMV viral load was negative. Cellept
decreased to 500mg 3x/day.
Imodium was started. Diarrhea resolved. NG was removed and diet
slowly advanced and tolerated. TPN was discontinued. Ensure
supplements were tolerated tid. Imodium was discontinued.

On [**5-13**], hematocrit was 22.6. She was given 2 units of PRBC with
a hct increase to 28. She stabilized at 30.

PT recommended rehab was recommended. She was screened and
accepted at NE [**Hospital1 **]. Prograf was increased to 6mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-15**]
for a trough level of 6.4. Goal trough prograf level is 10. She
was left on prednisone 20mg qd due to high sensitivity to her
donor. She will require labs on [**5-16**] for chem 7 and a trough
prograf with results called to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]. Labs should then be
done every Monday and Thursday.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 43 yo Thai speaking male with ESRD on HD, HTN
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-26**] after being notified that blood
cultures drawn on [**6-24**] returned positive for GPC in [**1-28**] bottles.
He arrived to HD on [**6-24**] with rigors and chills, but was
afebrile to 99.1, and had blood cx's drawn. On arrival to the
ED, he was afebrile to 96.8, with BP 92/38, and was admitted to
medicine for further work-up. He was given 1g vanco x1, 1 g
ceftaz x1, which were continued on the floor. ROS were negative
for any fever, cough, SOB, dysuria, odynophagia or any other
localizing symptoms. It was felt that his tunneled HD line was
likely the source, and it was planned to have that line removed.
Pt was dialyzed on [**6-26**] through his still maturing AVF in his L
arm.
On [**6-27**], pt became increasingly hypotensive, with BPs at 80/40.
He was otherwise afebrile to 97.8, but Tmax 100.3, with HR 70s,
RR 20s, and satting 100% on RA. He was given 1L NS bolus without
improvement in his blood pressure. Pt was transferred to the ICU
for closer monitoring. He was transferred to the floor after he
was hemodynamically stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 43 yo male with history of ESRD [**1-28**] HTN presents
with high-grade bacteremia with 2/2 bottles of pansensitive
Enterococcus and Enterobacter and 4/4 bottles of GNR.

1. Enterococcal/Enterobacter bacteremia: Patient with
polymicrobial bacteremia secondary to infected tunneled HD line;
no other localizing symptoms on admission. Initially hypotensive
with BPs in 80/40's consistent with sepsis. He was transferred
to the MICU for closer management, no pressors were required.
His tunneled HD Line was pulled and he was started on Vancomycin
and Levaquin, as per ID.  He also had been on Ceftaz,
Meperidine, and Linezolid, all of which were stopped in the
MICU. TTE was done and did not suggest any vegetations or
abcesses. TEE was then done and showed a moderate sized aortic
vegetation that was consistent with aortic regurgitation, which
was auscultated on exam. Patient was seen by CT surgery and felt
that he would require AVR after he had completed his 6 week
course of antibiotics and suggested he undergo cardiac
catheterization as part of the pre-op evaluation. Patient was
also seen by cardiology was consulted Vancomycin was changed to
Ampicillin, as per ID, who felt that Enterococcus was more
sensitive to this drug. Two weeks later he became neutropenic,
developed a diffuse erythematous rash, and started spiking
temperatures.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Marked cardiomegaly, with evidence of prior myocardial
infarction in the left ventricular apex, with likely areas of
scarring, and aneurysm formation at the apex. Evaluation is
limited on this non-gated study, but a dedicated cardiac CT
could be performed if clinically indicated to further evaluate
this region.

[**2158-12-16**] - ECHOCARDIOGRAM
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to muliple areas of severe
hypokinesis and akinesis (see figure), with posterobasal
dyskinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2155-3-17**], the tricuspid
regurgitation is probably increased. Left ventricular
contractile function remains profoundly depressed.
.
[**2158-12-16**] - Left Foot
Three views of the left foot were brought to our review. There
is
irregularity and thickening of the distal portion of the fifth
metatarsal that might represent chronic old fracture. There is
additional irregularity and potential old healed fracture of the
distal second metatarsal.
There is lysis/fracture of the distal part of the proximal third
phalanx with potentially some degree of the subcutaneous air. In
the absence of prior studies for comparison, the chronicity of
these findings cannot be determined.
There is dislocation of the third metatarsophalangeal joint,
chronicity is
also undetermined. If clinically warranted, further evaluation
with MR, more sensitive study for osteomyelitis.
.
[**2158-12-18**] - ART EXT (REST ONLY)
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity ischemia at
rest. Mild left lower extremity peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease with
predominant SFA/tibial location.
.
[**2158-12-20**] - VENOUS ULTRASOUND (MAP)
IMPRESSION: Patent right greater saphenous and bilateral lesser
saphenous
veins with reasonable diameters for bypass.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Unresponsiveness/VTACH - 61 y.o. man with significant cardiac
history who became acutely unresponsive at home. CPR initiated,
had BP and pulse by the time EMS arrived. Confused in ED, CT
scan of the head was unrevealing.  Neuro consulted in the ED and
they felt unlikely to be primary neuro issue. No PE or
pneumothorax on CTA.  The patient was ROMI.  The patient was
admitted to MICU for hypotension and monitoring overnight.  The
EP Cardiology team was consulted and they found 6 minutes of
spontaneous VT occurring precisely at 7PM on the night of
admission after interrogating his pacer.  His device was not
programmed to fire for this particular arrhythmia.  His device
was reprogrammed. The patient had no further significant
arrhythmic events during this admission.  He was noted to have
anterograde amnesia after his arrest which most likely related
to transient ischemia in the brain.  The patient will require
follow up with behavioral neurology.
.
# Osteomyelitis - The patient had a chronic left LE ulceration
related to a hospitalization several years ago.  It looked
erythematous and had purulent drainage on admission.  Podiatry
was consulted for deep tracking foot ulcer on left plantar
surface. Podiatry ecommended broad spectrum antibiotics.  A foot
xray was consistent with osteomyelitis.  Non-invasive arterial
studies were obtained to evaluate the blood flow to his LE prior
to an debridement.  The patient had poor arterial blood flow in
his left LE and [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgery was consulted and they
recommended
angiography and possible revascularization procedure in the next
week.  He was discharged on Linezolid and Ciprofloxacin.  He has
close follow up arranged with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1106**] surgery and
podiatry.
.
# CHF, systolic.  His last EF 25%. He appeared clinically
euvolemic.  His digoxin and sotalol were continued.  His
diuretics (lasix and spironolactone) were restarted at lower
doses given the patient's renal function. Echocardiogram was
preformed during this admission.
.
# Renal Function - The patient's creatinine began to rise during
this admission most which was felt to be secondary to vancomycin
toxicity.  The patients diuretics were held.  He was not
pre-renal by labs or volume-depleted on exam.  There was not
evidence of AIN, ATN or renal obstruction.  His creatinine
improved after the vancomycin was discontinued.
.
# The patient's stable medical issues include: Hypothyroidism,
Hyperlipidemi, Anxiety, Insomnia,

Brief Hospital Course:
Initial plan for patient was to go to OR for repair of the
umbilical hernia. He has a new onset of ascites and there is
concern for erosion of hernia and/or infection. He was admitted
following hemodialysis.
On the morning of the intended surgery, his INR was 1.8 and PTT
42. Plan was to give Vitamin K pre-op and have FFP on call to
OR. During the infusion of the Vitamin K the patient suffered an
apparent anaphylactic reaction to the IV Vitamin K and he
required resuscitation to include intubation.
He was transferred to the ICU where he was stablized, and
ultimately extubated.
He was transferred back to the surgical floor. However it was
felt that the risk of the operative procedure would outweight
the benefit of fixing the hernia, so it was determined to send
the patient home without the hernia repair.
He is to wear an abdominal binder at all times, one was provided
to the patient prior to discharge.
He will continue on his usual home medications and be followed
by the liver team as he has been prior to this admission. He
will also continue his hemodialysis per outpatient schedule.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old man with PMH of colostomy 20 years ago who
presents with bleeding per rectum. He reports being in his
normal state of health until 4 days ago, when he noticed slight
stomach ache, then had maroon bowel movements, [**4-13**] daily. He
reports that this continued until the morning of presentation,
when he had a syncopal episode and went to the ER on [**Location (un) 7453**] by EMS. He was found to have a HCT of 19, and was given
3 units prbc. An abdominal CT was performed with showed possible
gastric mass but was limited by lack of contrast. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] by [**Location (un) **].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], his initial hct was 26. He was tachycardic to 117 but
blood pressure was 137/56. He had a bowel movement reported to
be ""maroon"" with some black parts, but denies black bowel
movments otherwise. He was admitted to the ICU for further
management and endoscopy.
.
ROS: He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis,
fever, chills, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath,
or other concerns.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 87 years old man, previously relatively
healthy, who developed anorexia and had a 15 lbs weight loss
over the past 6 weeks. He states that he had his last full
""real"" meal about 6 weeks ago after which he ""lost interest"" in
eating. He specifically denies any problems with dysphagia, pain
with eating or swallowing, choking, food getting stuck, early
satiety, nausea or vomiting. He also denies any fevers or
chills, and continues
to have small bowel movements. Over the past 6 weeks he has been
only taking liquids to stay hydrated, no solid food, and has
lost at least 15 lbs as a result. He has a very mild shortness
of breath but in general aside from ""not wanting to eat"" denies
anything else that is bothering him at present.

He has visited his PCP several times and was finally referred
for admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital due to failure to thrive. He
had a CT today which shows a large left diaphragmatic hernia
with abdominal contents in the left chest, with organo-axial
volvulus. He received zosyn and Protonix 40 at [**Hospital1 **] and was
transferred here for further management of this complex surgical
problem.

[**2130-3-14**] CXR :
Patient's condition required examination in upright sitting
position using AP frontal and left lateral views. The heart
shadow is
difficult to delineate in detail because of overlapping
mediastinal structures including a large left-sided hiatal
hernia. Significant cardiac enlargement is unlikely and the
pulmonary vasculature is not congested. Relative prominence of
the central pulmonary vessels is identified but more attenuated
appearance of the periphery does not demonstrate any evidence of
advanced CHF.
There are some old parenchymal scars in the apical area but no
active
abnormalities are seen. Bilaterally, the lateral pleural spaces
are blunted probably by pleural effusions mild-to-moderate
degree. There is a large sized hiatal hernia with typical
air-fluid level in retrocardiac position. No other pulmonary or
cardiovascular abnormalities can be identified. Our records do
not include previous chest examinations available for
comparison. An outside chest CT has been transferred in to our
PACS system and shows the presence of a large hiatal hernia.

[**2130-3-23**] CXR post left thoracentesis


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital, kept NPO and hydrated
with IV fluids. Based on his symptoms and anatomy, repair of his
large paraesophageal hernia was recommended.  Unfortunately he
became delirious after having low dose Ativan which was given
preoperatively to reduce his anxiety.  He was taken to the
Operating Room for surgery on [**2130-3-15**] but immediately refused
the surgery when he arrived in the Operating Room. He appeared
confused and delirious, the surgery was cancelled and he
returned to the floor.

The Psychiatry service evaluated him and felt that the confusion
and delirium was prompted by Ativan in combination with poor
nutritional status and his age. At that point the patient wanted
surgery again.  A decision was made to place a PICC line and
give TPN for 4-5 days prior to operating with the attempt to
help improve his nutritional status.  A PICC line was placed on
[**2130-3-16**] and TPN began.

In the mean time he worked with Physical Therapy and had no more
episodes of confusion or delirium.

On [**2130-3-20**] he was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a
laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with PEG tube
placement. He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the
PACU in stable condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and
his pain was well controlled.  Following transfer to the
Surgical floor he continued to make good progress.  His pain was
controlled with Tylenol alone and his mental status was intact.
His TPN continued and eventually tube feedings were started and
well tolerated.  He was maintained on 2 cal HN 1 can TID.  His
TPN was weaned off [**2130-3-23**] and his PICC line was removed.

His chest xray on admission to the hospital was notable for
bilateral pleural effusions but his respiratory status was not
compromised.  His effusions did increase in size and on [**2130-3-23**]
he has a left thoracentesis for 1 liter of serosanguinous fluid.
 He tolerated it well and his subsequent chest xray demonstrated
no pneumothorax and a clear diaphram.  He was breathing
comfortably off of oxygen and had room air saturations of 95%.

He continued to work with Physical Therapy who recommended that
he go to a short term rehab prior to returning home to increase
his mobility and endurance.  From a surgical standpoint he
continued to do well.  His post sites were healing well and his
PEG site was dry.  After a long hospital stay he was discharged
to rehab on [**2130-3-24**].

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 53 year-old gentleman with HCV cirrhosis and
refractory lymphoblastic lymphoma/ALL on rituximab and
prednisone who presents with altered mental status. His mother
found him this morning with increased lethargy and complaining
of diffuse back pain. The back pain was unchanged from his usual
back pain, secondary to his ALL, and was not relieved by
morphine or methadone. He was recently admitted to the BMT
service from [**11-27**] until [**12-1**] for fevers and progressive ALL.
Infectious work-up was unremarkable and his fevers were
atrributed to a reaction to platelet transfusion. Of note, he
had another admission earlier in [**Month (only) **] at which point he
developed a strep viridans line infection (from PICC line)-- the
PICC line was removed, he was treated with a course of PCN G
which was changed to augmentin at his last admission with the
last dose due either yesterday or today. After finding him this
morning, his mother brought him back to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] today for
readmission and an ambulance was called from there to bring him
to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.3, BP 122/83, HR 100, RR 12,
100% on 4L. He was sleepy but A+O x3. Pt was noted to be very
uncomfortable, complaining of back pain. While in the ED, he
became
more delirious, writhing around in bed, refusing pain
medications, and perseverating on wanting to get out of bed to
urinate. Pt was intubated for CT head and abdomen. Spiked temp
to 101.8 rectally but remained hemodynamically stable. He was
given ceftriaxone, vanco, and acyclovir for empiric meningitis
coverage. LP was deferred given platelet count of 14. CT head
was negative and CT abdomen was notable for slightly worsened
ascites, new bibasilar opacities. Attempts to place OGT and
foley were unsuccessful and patient was noted to only have 40cc
of UOP while in the ED.

Past Medical History:
<b>HEMATOLOGIC/ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:</b>
Mr. [**Known lastname 2479**] was diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma in
[**2116-1-31**].  He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2115-12-30**] with
complaints of diffuse myalgias and arthralgias. A CT scan
demonstrated multiple enlarged portahepatis lymph nodes (largest
1.5 x 2.7 cm)and portacaval lymph nodes (largest 1.9 cm x 3.4 )
as well as multiple mildly enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes, the
largest measuring 1.2 x 1.9cm. On [**2116-1-6**], he underwent a
CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of a portahepatis lymph node
which was nondiagnostic.
A bone marrow biopsy was obtained on [**2116-2-26**], demonstrating
involvement by high-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Tumor cells were diffusely positive for pan B cell markers CD20
and PAX-5, with co-expression of CD10 and bcl-2.  TdT staining
was equivocal, with predominantly cytoplasmic staining and a
rare cell with dim nuclear staining.  MIB-1 staining showed an
overall proliferation index of 50-60%, with focal areas with a
higher fraction.  The differential diagnosis was felt to include
lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (precursor B-cell
lymphoma/leukemia) or a blastic transformation/progression of a
mature B cell lymphoma. It was noted that a definitive diagnosis
would require flow cytometry and molecular studies, which could
not be performed because there were no blasts in the peripheral
blood and a marrow aspirate could not be obtained (dry tap).
However, the peripheral blood sample was sent for
immunophenotyping, which demonstrated a new population of CD34
positive cells and a small population of CD19 positive cells in
the ""blast"" gait, without expression of TdT.  It was felt that
these findings should be interpreted with caution since no
blasts were identified on a corresponding peripheral smear.
Given his significant liver dysfunction and other medical
co-morbidities, the initial treatment regimen chosen for the
patient consisted of R-CHOP, which was initiated on [**2116-3-4**].
He received a second cycle of chemotherapy on [**2116-3-24**],
consisting of R-CHOP without vincristine, which was held
secondary to neuropathy. Modified Hyper-CVAD Course A was given
on [**2116-4-10**], with a second course given on [**2116-5-15**] and a third
course on [**2116-6-22**]. Course B was not given due to his history of
hepatic cirrhosis. Of note, the patient has known retinal
involvement by his lymphoma, for which he is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of ophthalmology. A liver biopsy on [**5-8**] and repeat bone
marrow biopsies on [**6-12**] and [**7-19**] have shown no evidence of
recurrent lymphoma.
The patient presented on [**2116-10-15**] with myalgias, headache,
mental status changes, and fevers. A CBC showed a WBC of 7.2
with 14% blasts. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated marked
fibrosis and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. He
was treated with rituximab 500mg, given in three doses of 100mg,
200 mg, and 200mg on [**10-9**] - [**10-11**]. In addition, he was treated
with rituximab 375mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2, doxorubicin
20mg/m2, and dexamethasone 20mg from [**10-19**]- [**10-21**].
The patient was noted to have recurrence of peripheral blasts on
[**2116-11-9**], with a bone marrow biopsy on [**2116-11-11**] showing residual
leukemia in the marrow. After extensive discussion, he opted to
continue palliative chemotherapy with rituximab and prednisone.
Rituximab was started on [**2116-11-16**] at 100mg, with plans to
continue threrapy with 200mg daily on [**11-17**] and [**11-18**].

CXR (s/p intubation): Although on the frontal view, the
electronic measurement of the distance from the ET tube tip to
the carina is less than 6 cm, the tip is above the upper margin
of the clavicles, and it is probably 3 cm above optimal
placement, with the discrepancy explained by marked patient
kyphosis. Aside from mild plate-like atelectasis at the base of
the left base, lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion.
Heart size is normal.
.
CT abd/pelvis: Slightly worsened ascites. No change in
splenomegaly, cholelithiasis, portal lymphadenopathy. Bibasal
opacities new since [**Month (only) 359**], could be due to atelectasis,
pneumonia, aspiration.
.
CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. MR
with
gadolinium would be more sensitive for intracranial infections
or masses.
.
KUB: Non-specific bowel gas pattern without free intraperitoneal
air.
.
CXR PA and lat: Interpretation is limited by patient rotation
and
kyphotic angulation. However, there is no evidence of pleural
effusion or focal consolidation. Allowing for change in
positioning, the study is overall not significantly changed
since [**2116-11-27**]. There is a focus of linear atelectasis at the
left lung base. Wedge compression deformities of two low
thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 53 year-old male with a history of relapsing
refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who
presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension.
Patient was hypotensive, started on pressors, given IVF,
worsened in the setting of adrenal insuffiency, and synthetic
hepatic dysfunction. Patient was intubated. Once infectious
etiology was eliminated, patient's dim prognosis was discussed
with family and a determination was made to make the patient
CMO. Patient was extubated and started on morphine drip.
Patient, due to high drug tolerance, continued to have pain and
was responsive on morphine drip. Patient was transferred from
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to BMT floor for CMO continuation. Patient continued to
show signs of discomfort and sedatation was switched to dilaudid
and ativan drip. Patient expired at 7:20 pm on [**2116-12-10**]
secondary to respiratory failure from relapsing refractory ALL
in the presence of the family. The proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2479**], the
patient's son, consented to a full autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84119**] is an 85 year-old woman with resp failure/vent
dependent s/p trach, recent PEs, sCHF (EF 25%), AF, and PVD who
is transferred from rehab because of unresponsiveness and low
tidal volumes and is admitted to MICU for further management.
.
She was discharged on [**2169-1-13**] from the thoracics service after
presenting from an OSH with tracheal laceration in the setting
of traumatic intubation and sub-cutaneous emphysema
post-intubation.  Her recent history prior to that includes a
fall on [**10-31**] with a C2 odontoid fracture and diagnosis of PEs
in the setting of dyspnea on [**2168-12-10**] requiring intubation
(complicated by trach injury) for hypercapnea.  On the thoracics
service, she [**Date Range 1834**] multiple bronchoscopies and trach
placement ((#7 [**Last Name (un) 295**]) and revisions with clot demonstrated in
posterior trachea and trach dislodgement.  She was discharged on
trach cpap with cmv onvernight.  She was transitioned from CMV
ventilation to CPAP, and was able to tolerate trach collar for
unspecified periods of time.
.
At rehab, she had AMS/unresponsiveness which is different from
her baseline, and low tidal volumes on pressure support and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  ABG 7.24/44/91
(?may be an error) and 98.6 74 26 95/61 92% on fio2 40% per
rehab notes.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: 99 61  106/49 100% on
vent. CXR showed  pleural effusions but no acute findings and IP
was consulted and felt trach was in good position and she did
not need urgent intervention.  Thoracics was also notified and
will follow the patient.  Head CT neg.  UA was grossly positive
and cipro was started.  She was also on a heparin gtt on arrival
and this was stopped when coags returned within INR 6.  She was
then admitted for further management.

Blood Cultures: NGTD

CT Head [**1-14**]
IMPRESSION:

1. No definite acute intracranial pathology. No bleed or
evidence for acute
vascular territorial infarction. However, if there is concern
for acute
infarct, MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging, if feasible, is
more sensitive.

2. Chronic small vessel microvascular infarction and global
parenchymal
atrophy.

3. Secretions within bilateral sphenoid and right mastoid apical
air cells,
some of which may relate to the (reported) presence of
tracheostomy.

CXR [**1-18**]:
The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is
unchanged. There is slight interval improvement in vascular
engorgement. No
change in bibasal left more than right atelectasis is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute on Chronic respiratory failure:  The patient was
admitted due to altered mental status and low tidal volumes.
The patient with known traumatic intubation at OSH c/b tracheal
injury, and trached here requiring multiple revisions.  Also
with COPD. Patient went into respiratory distress with hypoxia
and hypotension.  She was started on levophed and [**Month/Year (2) 1834**]
emergent bronch.  The bronch showed granulation tissue
obstructing 95% of her tube.  The tube was passed farther down
past the site of obstruction and the patient's respiratory
status improved and was weaned off levophed.  The patient then
[**Month/Year (2) 1834**] repeat bronch the following day on [**1-15**] that showed
the tube to be patent and the tracheal laceration to be healing
well.  The patient's respiratory status remained stable and her
ventilator settings at the time of dicharge were: CMV, Vt
(Set):450, RR (Set): 14, PEEP: 5 cmH2O, and FiO2: 40%.  The
patient was also treated for a VAP based on CXR (left
retrocardiac opcaity and increasing sputum).  She was started on
Vanco/Cefepime on [**1-16**] for presumed VAP.  She was then changed
to Vanco/Meropenem given her ESBL urine cx results.  Her sputum
subsequently grew out GNR and she will continue vancomycin and
meropenem for a planned 8 day course (last day:[**1-24**]).  A PICC
line was placed on [**1-18**].  The patient did have a low grade temp
of 100.5 at the time of discharge.  This was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 84121**] at [**Hospital1 **] and is aware.

#. VAP: See above for respiratory course.  Patient with planned
8 day course of meropenem with final day being [**2169-1-24**].  Sputum
is currently growing GNR and needs to be followed up for final
speciation and sensitivities.

#UTI: The patient was intially treated with ciprofloxacin on
admission for a positive UA.  She was then broadened to
Vanco/Cefepime given she was at rehab for resistant organisms.
The UCx returned ESBL E. Coli and was switched to meropenem for
a planned 8 day course (last day [**2169-1-24**]).

# Altered mental status:  The patient came in minimally reactive
which was a change from her baseline per the family.  Her change
in mental status was attributed to her infection and after
treatment for her VAP and UTI her mental status returned to
baseline.  She is able to follow very simple commands and answer
some simple yes/no questions.

# CHF:  The patient had an EF 25% per report.  Her metoprolol
and lisinopril was held given her infection and normal blood
pressure. Additionally, her lasix was initially held.  The
patient was restarted on her metoprolol at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], but
several doses were held secondary to hypotension and
bradycardia.  Her blood pressure and heart rate should be
monitored at rehab and titrate metoprolol accordingly.  The
patient was restarted on her lasix 20mg po BID given her volume
overload. Her weight, respirtory status and I/O should be
monitored and lasix titrated at rehab.

#Anemia: The patient admission Hct was 26 and slowly trended
down to Hct 21.  Her hemolysis labs were negative and there were
no signs of active bleeding.  Her guaiac was negative.  She was
trnasfused one unit [**1-18**] and her Hct remained stable.  Upon
discharge her Hct was 25.7.

# PEs:  Patient with recent diagnosis in [**11-30**].  The patient was
continued on coumadin 3mg daily and brdiged with lovenox 60mg
q12 for a subtherapeutic INR.  Upon discharge her coumadin was
increased to 5mg daily and continued on lovenox 60mg [**Hospital1 **] until
INR >2.0.

# C2 fracture:  Patient with C2 fracture after a fall on [**10-31**].
She was maintained on a [**Location (un) 2848**] J-collar.  The patient should have
follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient.

# AFib:  Patient's metoprolol was initially held due to ongoing
infection.  Her metoprolol was restarted on 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and
continued on systemic coagulation.

History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 17385**] is a 38 y.o. male with a history of psoriatic
arthritis on immunosuppresive therapy, HTN, HL, DM, cervicogenic
headaches who was recently discharged on [**1-8**] for left leg pain.
Pt reprots that he presented to the ED on [**2202-1-3**] for L heel pain
radiating to knees. He was initially treated with vanc and cipro
for question of septic left knee; the aspirate showed [**Numeric Identifier **] WBC
and 94% PMN but neg gram stain and culture and no crystals so
abx discontinued. LENI was negative for DVT or [**Hospital Ward Name **] cyst. No
fx on x-ray. This was thought to be a psoriatic arthritis flare,
so his prednisone was increased from his home dose of 30mg to
60mg daily with improvement in his inflammation. His pain
subsequently reutrned and repeat LENI was negative. Pt was
started on gabapentin for presumed fibromyalgia and discharged
yesterday on a stable pain regimen of MS contin with prn
dilaudid. He saw Rheum today who referred him to Derm for
evaluation of a superficial erythematous plaque, questioned
erythema nodosum. Derm did not think this was consistent but was
concerned about compartment syndrome so referred pt to ED.
.
In the ER, vitals were: T 98.2, P 79, BP 145/77, RR 17, O2sat
98. LENI neg for DVT but pt was noted to have an extensive left
posterior calf subcutaneous complex fluid collection. Ortho did
not see evidence of compartment syndrome and recommended
vascular c/s to rule out necrotizing fasciitis given the fluid
collection. Vascular did not think this was consistent with
necrotizing fasciitis. An MRI of the LE was done per Rads recs,
and this showed small fluid collections concerning for abscess
in his gastrocnemius that were too small to be drained with no
evidence of osteomyelitis. He was given vancomycin, zosyn, and
clindaycin. He also received his home meds of gabapentin, MS
contin, and po dilaudid. He was admitted to medicine with VS on
transfer: T 98.5, P 76, BP 136/68, RR 15, O2sat 98RA.
.
On evaluation on the floor, patient complains of persistent LE
pain and tenderness which is controlled on his pain regimen. His
LLE knee effusion has improved markedly since his recent
admission. He denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
.
ROS: Mild constipation d/t pain meds. Review of systems
otherwise negative.
.

Past Medical History:

Imaging:
[**2202-1-20**] US: No significant change in size of fluid collection
in the left popliteal fossa extending into the left posterior
calf, which contains small foci of gas.
.
[**2202-1-16**] US: 1. No evidence of left lower extremity DVT between
the left popliteal and common femoral veins. 2. Left popliteal
fossa collection extending into the calf, again seen.
.
[**2202-1-12**] CT of LLE - 1. Redemonstration of two loculated fluid
collections in the left calf. Slightly increased inferior extent
of the collection along the anteromedial edge of the medial head
of the gastrocnemius muscle. Otherwise no significant change. 2.
Subcutaneous edema along the anterior left leg, in keeping with
cellulitis, unchanged. 3. Small loculates of air within the
lower collection is attributed to recent aspiration procedure.
No other evidence of soft tissue emphysema identified.
.
[**2202-1-12**] TTE - The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious
echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global LV systolic
function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

[**2202-1-22**]
MRI calf
1. Persisted popliteus muscle collection and collection at the
anteromedial aspect of the medial head of the gastrocnemius
muscle.
2. Post-surgical findings following incision and drainage is a
new collection posterior to the medial head of the gastrocnemius
muscle, contiguous with the medial open skin defect and contains
low signal intensity foci, which may be due to air or possibly
packing.
3. Muscle edema in the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle
and vastus
medialis obliquus muscle, likely postoperative.
4. A small knee joint effusion and mild synovitis without
definite findings of septic arthritis. As previously noted, the
popliteus tendon sheath can communicate with the knee joint.
Cartilage thinning and subchondral cysts along patella may be
degenerative. Clinical correlation is requested.

.
[**2202-1-12**] Radiology UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS -1. Large complex
fluid collection tracking from the left popliteal fossa along
the medial left calf to the proximal mid calf region. Since it
is difficult to fully assess the extent and geography of this
collection on ultrasound, an MRI is suggested for further
characterization. 2. Smaller fluid collection at the left
anterior knee measuring 3.5 cm. 3. No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in the left leg.
.
[**1-8**] LENIS: No left lower extremity DVT. Extensive left
posterior calf subcutaneous complex fluid collection.
.
[**1-8**] MRI calf:  1. Two loculated fluid collections concerning
for abcess collections, one in the substance of the popliteus
muscle, and the other along the anteromedial edge of the medial
gastrocnemius muscle.
2. Subcutaneous edema likely represents cellulitis in this
setting.
3. No evidence of osteomyelitis.
4. Limited assessment of knee joint -- please see comment (No
obvious direct communication between these collections and the
knee joint effusion is identified, but the popliteus abscess
does extend along the popliteus tendon, which can communicate
with the knee in some patients. Full assessment of the
relationship between the knee joint and popliteus is limited on
these views.)

Brief Hospital Course:
38 years old male with psoriatic arthritis on immunosuppression,
DM, HTN, HL p/w LLE erythema, swelling and pain, found to have
gastrocnemius abscesses and overlying cellulitis.
.
# Acute renal failure: Patient noted to have acutely elevated
creatinine after I&D by surgery.  All urine lytes testing
indicated pre-renal etiology. Resolved after fluid challenge. He
again had acute renal failure on [**2202-1-27**] in the setting of having
received increased doses of pain medications and resultant
hypoperfusion. His peak creatinine was 3.0, and resolved to his
baseline of 0.8-0.9 by the time of discharge.
.
# Left calf fluid collection with overlying cellulitis: No DVT
or [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst on multiple imaging studies.  No compartment
syndrome per Orthopedic evaluation.  No osteomyelitis on MRI and
not consistent with necrotizing fascitis per Vascular surgery.
It was noted on imaging that he had gastroceminis fluid
collection and overlying cellulitis.  No signs of septic joint
from evaluation of knee aspiration.  He had one positive blood
culture with pan-sensitive staph.  He was placed on zosyn, later
narrowed to nafcillin.  All other microbiology data were
negative.  IR and vascular surgery helped drained the fluid
collection.  Leg incision is to heal via secondary intention.
He developed a body rash that was determined to be folliculitis.
 He completed the 2 week course IV antibiotics in house.  His
major issue remained to be pain management.  He required a large
amount of narcotics to control his pain, but after overdose (see
below) he was switched to a very conservative regimen.  It was
determined that the swelling/fluid collection is from psoriatic
arthritis versus idiopathic spondylarthropathy. He was
discharged in stable condition. Muscle biospy showed necrotic
muscle with granulation tissue.
.
# Medication overdose: On [**2202-1-26**], on recommendation from the
pain service, patient's MS Contin dose was increased to 160 mg
TID from 130 mg TID, in addition to being ordered for PRN
Dilaudid. Later that night, Pt fell while ambulating. He had a
CT scan which was negative for acute intracranial pathologu.
Morning after the fall, Pt was noted to be somnolent and
hypotensive. He was given Naloxone 0.4 mg X3 and would arouse
briefly after each dose. He continued to be hypotensive after a
bolus of 1L of NS. He was transferred to the MICU for further
monitoring. In the MICU he was monitored closely and his
hypotension and mental status gradually improved. He was called
out back to the floor on [**2202-1-28**]. He never required intubation.
After being called out, he was normotensive and alert and
oriented X 3. It was believed his hypotension and altered mental
status were caused by medication overdose in the setting of
acute kidney injury.  He was discharged on oxycodone 5mg Q4
hours, which he did well on for the 3 days prior to his
discharge. He will follow up with the pain clinic as an
outpatient.
.
# Psoriatic arthritis: On Golimumab every month, azathioprine,
prednisone. Rheumatology was consulted and suggested to decrease
prednison level to 20mg from 30 mg.  He continued on PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
with Bactrim.  Indomethacin was held due to renal failure but
restarted on discharge.  He will continue to follow with
rhematology as an outpatient.
.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].

You were admitted because your left knee was swollen, red and
painful and you also had a pain on your left leg and foot. The
rheumatology team evaluated and took fluid from your knee. You
were initially treated with antibiotic for possible infection
and pain medications. The fluid was cultured for infection but
this was negative.  You did have a blood culture that was
positive and we provided you with a two week course of
antibiotics.  We also had interventional radiology and vascular
surgery to help drain the fluids from your leg.  This helped
your swelling.  You required a lot of pain medications to
control the pain, and at one point went to the ICU because your
system did not clear the medicines adequately. You are now on a
much more conservative pain regimen. You will follow up with
pain doctors as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] outpatient.  We determined that the fluid
collection is not due to infection, and more likely a
rheumatological problem.  [**Name (NI) **] will follow up with the
rheumatologists as an outpatient.

Please note we made the following changes to your medications.
1. Decrease prednisone from 60mg to 20mg
2. Stop MSContin
3. Stop gabapentin
4. Stop dilaudid
5. Start oxycodone every four hours for pain control. Never
drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery with this
medication.
6. Start iron supplementation
7. Start Sarna lotion and mupirocin cream for your rash and
follow up with your PCP for resolution
8. Start tylenol 1 gram every six hours as needed for pain. Do
not exceed 4 grams in one day.
9.  Start omeprazole daily to protect your stomach lining while
you are taking prednisone and indomethacin (which can cause
irritation)
10. Start colace and senna to ensure you have having bowel
movements while on oxycodone and iron supplementation. Don't
take these medicines when you are having loose stools.

Follow up with your PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for the results from your
muscle biopsy, which are still pending.

A visiting nurse will be coming to your home to help with your
wound vac. Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (vascular) as listed

Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Short P-R interval. Leftward

T wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2165-11-27**] no
significant change.

Reports:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2166-1-15**] 1:07 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

KUB [**2166-1-21**]:
Given the clinical history findings are most compatible with
gastroenteritis.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2166-1-25**]:
1. Gross distention of the distal esophagus, as well as small
and large bowel. No small bowel obstruction and no definite
large bowel obstruction is seen, suggesting generalized ileus.
Although nondistention of large bowel past the sigmoid may
represent physiolgic process, peritoneal spread of tumor or
nondistention from chronic inflammation, with obstruction at
this level cannot be entirely excluded.
2. No significant interval change in size or degree of local
invasion of the pancreatic head and neck mass.
3. Occlusion of the portosplenic confluence with venous
collaterals, unchanged since [**10-31**].
4. Bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases,
unchanged since [**10-31**].
5. Interval development of small bilateral pleural
effusions/atelectasis, as well as perihepatic and perisplenic
ascites since [**10-31**].
6. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilitaion.

CXR [**2166-1-26**]:
There is a new right IJ line with tip in SVC. The right
subclavian line is unchanged. The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the
carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. There are bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right, with bilateral lower
lobe volume loss. There is no pneumothorax.

CT Head [**2166-1-27**]:
No CT evidence of an acute territorial infarct. No intracranial
hemorrhage. No abnormal enhancing lesion identified. Area of
encephalomalacia involving the right cerebellar hemisphere.
Changes suggestive of chronic microangiopathic change.

CXR [**2166-1-28**]:
Slight increase in pulmonary edema; similar appearance of
bilateral moderate pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
79F with locally advanced pancreatic CA on Xeloda and
oxaliplatin (C2D1 [**2166-1-8**]) admitted with diarrhea.

# Diarrhea:
Most likely [**1-25**] chemotherapy, though infectious cause possible.
Cdiff was negative.  She was given IV Fluids, prn antiemetics,
and her electrolytes were corrected prn.  After cdiff was
negative x 1, she was given symptomatic treatment of her
diarrhea with loperamide.  She continued to have nausea and
profuse diarrhea, and she was given tincture of opium as well as
octreotide.

# Sepsis:
After several days in the hospital, she became acutely
hypotensive, tachycardic and hypoxic.  She was emergently
transferred to the ICU, where NG tube was placed with immediate
output of almost a liter of feculent material.  She was put on
broad spectrum antibiotics and central line was placed for
aggressive fluid repletion.  Blood pressure was supported with
levophed.  She was intubated for airway protection given concern
for aspiration pneumonia.  Cause of patient's acute
decompensation was unclear.  The team considered infection from
bowel source (microperforation, SBP), aspiration event, or
possible PE.  CTA was not done given patient's worsening renal
function and unstable clinical status.

Surgery was consulted and did not feel that the patient was a
candidate for surgical intervention.

Patient remained intubated and on pressors for several days.
Antibiotics were selected to cover possible bowel pathogens
given concern that she could have had microperforations or
perhaps SBP given new finding of ascites on imaging.  Despite
aggressive care, the patient continued to deteriorate.  Her
daughters (and health care proxy) agreed that the patient would
not wish to continue aggressive care given her poor prognosis.
The decision was made with the attending to make the patient
comfort measures only; she was extubated and died later that
day.

Patient's daughters agreed that they would want an autopsy to
help understand what had caused their mother to deteriorate.

# Acute renal failure - Oliguric on arrival to ICU. Cr quickly
improved with IV fluids and support of MAPs.

# Pancreatic CA - Metastatic to lungs, although with fairly good
functional status prior to admission.  Onc fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] upon
ICU transfer.  Chemotherapy was held and patient's family agreed
upon comfort care after discussing the matter with her
oncologists, the ICU team, and palliative care.

# Coagulopathy:
Patient's INR increased during admission despite holding
coumadin.  DIC labs were negative.  Patient's INR improved with
FFP and vitamin K.

#. UTI:
There is a postive UA and bandemia. She was afebrile and had no
urinary symptoms.  UCx showed mixed flora.  She was given a
three day course of cipro.

recent on [**2140-5-5**]), CKD (Stage III) who initially presented [**5-17**]
with 4 weeks of lightheadedness and vertigo and 3 days of SOB.
.
She was seen by her primary cardiologist [**5-16**], at which time her
flecainide was d/c'ed and her metoprolol and diltiazem were
increased for rate control. Apparently she had not been taking
the prescribed doses of BB/CCB and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
with chest pressure and atrial fibrillation with RVR. Initially
she was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] where she was noted to be in volume
overload and diuresed with furosemide, 40 mg IV. She was also
given metoprolol (at increased dose from 12.5 to 25 then 50 [**Hospital1 **]
over the course of two days) and verapramil (180 mg qd) for rate
control. This morning she complained of chest pain, was noted to
be bradycardic (60s) and hypotensive (SBP in mid 70s). She was
given 1.5 lt of IVF bolus and started on dopamine (uptitrated to
20 mcg). After these interventions her pressure improved to the
100s but then decreased again to the 90s. Her urine output
remained low. She had cardiac enzymes drawn, the first set being
negative, an ECG without ST changes, and a TTE, which showed
global hypokinesis with EF of 25%. Reportedly her EF from a TEE
done in early [**Month (only) **] was near normal (reported as mild depressed
LVEF. Last ECHO before that was in 90s with normal EF. Also has
had a cath in the 90s with normal coronaries, per report.
Notably her INR is also elevated to 3.7, presumably secondary to
warfarin.
.
Several days prior to presentation her VNA found her to be
tachycardic to 120s, and was referred Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw her [**5-16**] and
d/ced her fleicanide and increased her metoprolol, which the
patient did not take as she did not pick up prescirption. She
also reports having chest pain/pressure o/n 4d PTA,
non-radiating, no n/v/diaphoresis resolved w/ burping. Patient
was recently admitted with Afib w/ RVR, was cardioverted on [**5-5**]
and discharged home on flecainide, verapamil, metroprolol. She
has had no palpitations, no syncope, no PND or orthopnea. Pt.
also reports persistent RLE edema, since her rehab discharge,
this is unchaged, pt. takes lasix prn for this.
.
In the CCU, the patient admits to feeling cold. She denies,
chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills, cough, abdominal pain,
or bleeding. There is no difficulty w/ speech. No dysuria, no
abdominal pain, constipation/diarrhea.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with h/o a fib s/p recent 2nd cardioversion on
[**5-5**], HTN, ? CAD s/p clean cath [**2127**], s/p recent femur fx, PNA
and cellulitis who p/w afib w/ RVR, persistent weakness,
lightheadedness, vertigo and DOE.
.
1. Afib w/ RVR. Pt. was admitted with presyncopal symptoms and
vertigo, likely from central hypoperfusion, though cerebellar
dysfunction could not be ruled out given positive romberg in
setting of intact proprioception.  She was HD stable on
admission and her INR was 3.6. Her Afib recurrence was felt to
be exacerbating CHF as evident on last TEE.  Patient was
restarted on Verapamil of 180mg, her BB was increased to 37.5mg
[**Hospital1 **] and her coumadin was held.  On HD#2, patient developed afib
with slow VR, chest pain, diaphoresis and nausea, her ECG was
unchanged and her CE were negative x1.  She subsequently
developed hypotension to mid 70s mmHgs, which did not respond to
IVF and required dopamine for HD stability.  She was temporarily
transferred to CCU where pressors were weaned within few hours
of arrival.  It was felt that her hypotension was secondary to
poor inotropy in setting of bradycardia from multiple nodal
blocking agents.  Throughout stay in CCU she was borderline
tachycardic and was eventually placed back on small dose of
lopressor for HR control. On HD#3 she was transferred to the
floor w/ HR of 100bpm and only on 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] of metoprolol.  She
remained HD stable and converted to atrial tachycardia vs. slow
aflutter.  Her BB was increased and she was started on low dose
digoxin without loading, 0.125 mg EOD.
.
On this regiment her HR was difficult to control.  She continued
to remain in Afib/flutter with HR in 100s despite 50mg TID of
BB, digoxin.  She was started on amiodarone and underwent
cardioversion on [**2140-5-24**].  This was successful, pt. was in sinus
rhythm.  Her BB was decreased to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] due to temporary
bradycardia to high 40s, digoxin was discontinued and amiodarone
decreased to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].  With this regimen, HR maintained in
50s, her DOE improved significantly and her lightheadedness and
dizziness resolved.  On [**5-25**] at ~ 11pm patient was noted be
unable to speak.  Her neurological deficits included R facial
droop and eye lid muscle weakness.  Code stroke was called, CT
head showed a L distal MCA stroke in insular region.  No tPA was
administered due to INR of 2.9. Her INR became supratherapeutic
with INR 3.9 on her day of discharge hence Coumadin is held for
now.  It needs to be restarted at 1mg once daily once INR <3.0
and needs daily monitoring until stable.  Dosing may need to go
up once Amiodarone dosing decreases to daily dosing on [**6-2**].
Also, patient should be started on lisinopril for heart
protection on [**6-2**].
.
2. CAD - Pt. had h/o CAD with no h/o MI, CABG or PCI.  She had a
clean cath in [**2127**]. Based on above PMHx it was not suspected
that she had flow limiting CAD, especially with no elevation of
CEs in setting of cardiogenic shock.  She ruled out for MI.  She
was continued on BB as above.
.
3. Systolic CHF.  Pt. had a nl EF in [**2127**] Echo, but no other
imaging except a TEE, where it was noted that she had mild
systolic dysfunction.  TTE here prior to hypotensive episode
showed global vertricular dysfunction w/ EF of 20-25%  Given
lack of significant CAD, this was felt to be most likely
tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy and treatment was focused on
HR control.  Pt. was volume overloaded on exam, likely
contributed by the tachycardia and poor filling.  She was
continued on home dose of lasix. She was started on ACE-I,
Lisinopril 5mg daily, however due to renal failure, Cr. 1.5 this
was discontinued.  Her lasix was held on [**5-26**].  This should be
restarted within a day as tolerated by volume status, likely
[**5-27**] (home lasix dose of 40mg PO).
.
4. Acute on Chronic RF: Cr on admission up to 1.3 Likely due
decreased CO w/ LV CHF in setting of afib.  Cr recovered to 1.1,
near baseline after complications with hypotension, however
bumpted back up s/p cardioversion in setting of receiving extra
10mg IV lasix.  Cr improved to 1.2 on [**5-26**].  Her lasix is
currently being held.
.
5. Left MCA infarct in the setting of therapeutic INR: Most
likely cardioembolic given the risk factor and patient returned
to Afib rhythm from sinus after cardioversion.  Pt was not a
thrombolytic or endovascular therapy candidate due to high INR
hence high bleeding risk.  Patient was transferred to the
neurology service on [**5-26**] and MRI showed that she has acute
superior division of L MCA infarct (precentral gyrus) but not a
large infarct hence safe for anticoagulation.

Patient remains unable to speak, but can make vocalizations, and
is able to swallow. She has mild R facial droop with weakness,
more in the arm than leg.  Physical and occupational therapy
recommended acute rehab.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response,
atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, cardiogenic shock
Secondary: Left MCA (middle cerebral artery) infarct while INR
therapeutic.


Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, improved heart rate - mostly
non-verbal/mute with new left MCA stroke with right facial droop
and some right arm weakness (more proximal and distal) but
strong in the lower extremities.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with recurrence of your rapid heart
rate and lightheadedness.  This was felt to be due to your
failed cardioversion.  You were treated with medications to
reduce your heart rate.

Your course was complicated by a rapid slowing of your heart and
very low blood pressures that require temporary stay in an
intensive care unit.  It was also determined that your heart's
pumping action was also poor.  For this reason and your heart
rate control, your medications were readjusted.

You undewent cardioversion on [**5-24**] but afterwards was found to
have right facial droop due to left MCA infarct.  This was while
your INR was therapeutic hence you were not candidate for
thrombolysis or endovascular therapy given high risk of
bleeding.

You were transferred to neurology service on [**5-26**] and evaluated
per physical and occupational therapy who recommend acute rehab
given your new stroke.  Speech therapist also evaluated who
recommended pureed diet with nectar liquid and crushed meds in
puree.

You were restarted on Amiodarone 200mg twice daily on [**5-27**] which
is to be continued for 1 week then starting on [**6-2**], please
switch to 200mg once daily.  Starting [**6-2**], please also start
low dose ACEI (e.g. lisinopril) for your severe CHF.

You will also need a repeat echo i 2~3 months and follow-up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 4~8 weeks.

You are going to an acute rehabilitation facility for aggressive
physical and occupational therapy plus speech therapy.  You will
also need telemetry to for heart rate monitoring plus daily labs
including INR for Coumadin dosing.  Coumadin dose may need to be
increased once Amiodarone dose decreases plus please continue to
monitor TSH while on Amiodarone.

Should you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness,
lightheadedness, severe weakness, worsening leg swelling,
difficulties with balance, worsening palpitations or any other
symptoms concerning to you, please call your primary care
doctor, your cardiologist or go to the nearest emergency room.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], within 2 weeks of discharge from the acute rehab
facility in [**Location (un) 38**], please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1247**] for an
appointment.

Repeat echo in 2~3 months plus follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] within 4~8 weeks.  Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] to

History of Present Illness:
59 yo man with severe asthma who originally presented w/ 3 days
of worsening dyspnea c/w prior exacerbations, now transferred to
the Medicine team for ongoing care. He had asthma exacerbation 3
wks ago requiring prednisone taper, which he completed about 1
wk ago.  Over the past few days, he has had productive cough and
pleuritic chest pain, but no F/C. Went to [**Location (un) **] HC on day
of admission and was treated w/ albuterol/atroven nebs and
solumedrol, but symptoms were unrelieved, prompting referral of
pt to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In ED, he was placed on continuous nebs and
given prednisone 40 mg, then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing
care.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], ABG was 7.29/47/83, which was concerning
for respiratory fatigue.  He was treated w/ heliox and
eventually offered BiPAP, though he refused BiPAP treatment.
Though he was afebrile, empiric treatment for CAP was begun w/
ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  He was found to have RSV
infection on viral culture, which is a likely explanation for
his current asthma exacerbation.  His respiratory status
improved steadily until the present time, when he is transferred
to the Medicine team for ongoing care.

Currently, the pt complains of ongoing dyspnea and cough that
are moderately controlled w/ nebulized albuterol.  He complains
of lumbar back pain that is partially relieved by percocet.
Denies any fever, chills, abd pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, hematochezia, and melena.

Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2200-5-20**]):
      Positive for Respiratory Syncytial viral antigen.

      SPECIMEN SCREENED FOR: ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3 INFLUENZA
A,B AND
      RSV.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Asthma Exacerbation: Pt's nasal washings returned positive
for RSV.  On admission he had marked wheezing and poor air
movement, with ABG of [**2142-9-4**]/83.  He gradually improved on
solumedrol, continuous nebs, advair, singulair, heliox, Azithro
(5 days) and Ceftriaxone.  Pt did not require intubation, and
his nebs were spaced out to q4hrs.  Pt's breathing was
comfortable and non-wheezy by HD#5 when observed from the door,
however, pt appears to exagerate end-expiratory wheezing and
laboured breathing when approached.  He was felt to have a
component of psychogenic dyspnea overlying his asthma
exacerbation.  He was slowly titrated down on his steroid dose,
and he frequently requested to be placed on higher doses of
steroids despite an improving exam and vitals.  Eventually, he
had both subjectively and objectively improved to the point
where he was tolerating oral steroids and was able to be
discharged home on a taper with plans to follow-up with his
outpatient pulmonologist.

2. Psych/Neuro: Cocaine Abuse and Opioid Dependence.  Pt's urine
tox screen was positive for cocaine and opioids.  Pt was
requiring two percocets every 4 hours for low back pain s/p
laminectomy.  Attempts to wean his percocets were made in effort
to minimize suppression of his cough.  However, pt was unhappy
with this recommendation and insisted on his usual dose of
percocets, stating that the wheezing/coughing greatly
exacerbated the back pain.  He was seen by the addictions
consult and social work while he was an inpatient; their
discussions culminated in an agreement that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would seek
outpatient counseling for his substance abuse difficulties,
which are both worsened by and worsen his chronic pain.
He was discharged on a brief course of oxycodone/acetaminophen,
with the understanding that should he have ongoing pain
medication requirements, he would need to finally establish a
primary care physician; he has been stating that this is
something he would do, but has failed to do so for months.  He
was provided with multiple names and numbers of providers in his
area, and he informed the team that he was dedicated to being
seen by one of them.

3. Hypertension: Pt was hypertensive on admission in setting of
his acute asthma exacerbation.  He continued to be hypertensive
and HCTZ was started, with a good effect and was tolerated well.
 His electrolytes and renal function remained stable on this new
medication, and he was advised to see a primary care doctor to
follow both this and his numerous other medical issues.

STUDIES:
-[**9-12**] ECG: Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Early
precordial R wave progression. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2189-8-27**] the sinus rate is much faster. The other findings are
similar.

-[**9-12**] CXR: No gross pulmonary process noted. If clinically
feasible, consider repeat study once patient is able to tolerate
the procedure.

-[**9-12**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic
process to explain the patient's symptoms.
  2. Status post orthotopic liver transplant with diffuse
anasarca. Known
portal vein thrombus is not well evaluated on the current study.

  3. Trace pleural effusions and minimal atelectasis.
  4. Unchanged 8 mm left renal stone.

-[**9-12**] CT Head 1. Stable appearance of the brain without evidence
of an acute intracranial abnormality.
2. The partially imaged orogastric tube appears to make a loop
in the
nasopharynx.

-[**9-12**] Abdominal U/S: Limited study as above with persistent main
portal vein thrombosis and no evidence of intrahepatic portal
vein flow, similar to [**2189-8-27**].

-[**9-21**] Renal U/S: 8-mm left renal calculus within the lower
pole, unchanged from CT scan of [**2189-9-12**]. No evidence of
hydronephrosis or obstruction.

-[**9-23**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1. Bilateral, multifocal
consolidative airspace opacities. These have progressed compared
to recent chest radiographs, and are new compared to [**2189-9-12**] CT of the abdomen and pelvis (when the lung bases were
imaged). This most likely represents multifocal pneumonia.
Aspiration and a component of pulmonary edema could also be
considered. Clinical correlation is advised.
2. Malpositioned left upper extremity PICC, with tip extending
into the right ventricle. This should be withdrawn for optimal
positioning.
3. Findings compatible with anemia.
4. Large pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonary
hypertension.
5. Status post liver transplantation. There is small ascites and
diffuse
anasarca, a distended IVC, and mild cardiomegaly, all compatible
with fluid overload.
6. 11-mm non-obstructing left renal stone.
7. No retroperitoneal hematoma or other source of blood loss, as
questioned.

-[**9-23**] CT Head: 1. Study limited by motion shows no large
intracranial hemorrhage or other obvious acute intracranial
abnormality.
  2. Persistent catheter fragment seen to course from one side
of nasal cavity to the other on prior CT of [**2189-9-12**]; clinical
correlation recommended.

-[**9-26**] RUQ U/S: Limited evaluation with the main portal vein
again not
visualized. However, flow appears present in the left hepatic
vein and left hepatic artery. Abdominal ascites.

-[**9-27**] Abd X-ray: No evidence for obstruction; NG tube in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **] for severe
encephalopathy requiring intubation in the ED for airway
protection. She was treated for hepatic encephalopathy, with
lactulose and rifaximin. Initial cultures revealed
carbapenemase-resistant E.coli, for which she was initially
treated with nitrofurantoin and amikacin. Nitrofurantoin was
subsequently discontinued. Per ID recommendations, antibiotics
were changed to colistin, then ultimately to tetracycline. She
was weaned off of the ventilator and was transferred to the
internal medicine service on [**9-16**]. Her lactulose dose was
increased. Her renal function worsened, which was believed
likely due to nephrotoxic medications. She was also started on
octreotride, midodrine and albumin for hepatorenal syndrome. Se
was transferred back to MICU Green on [**9-19**] for worsening
encephalopathy and labs consistent with low-grade DIC, including
a ten point hematocrit drop, thrombocytopenia, worsening
coagulation studies, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Hematology
was consulted and agreed with diagnosis of DIC. Over the
subsequent days, the patient required large amounts of blood
products, including red blood cells, platelets, cryoprecipitate,
and fresh frozen plasma. Despite these measures, she still had
large amounts of bloody output from her rectal tube; she was
felt too unstable to undergo any GI procedures, and was treated
with further blood transfusions. Her significant hypernatremia
and hypercalcemia improved to some degree during her stay in the
MICU. The patient's mental status did not improve, and she was
reintubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, which was partially
due to a new pneumonia. Her mental status was sufficiently poor
that she only required intermittent sedation for her
endotracheal tube. She had high residuals through her OG tube,
and tube feeds frequently had to be held. She had frequent
bloody secretions from her endotracheal tube; bronchoscopy
revealed diffuse oozing of blood throughout her bronchi.
Multiple family meetings were held, including a meeting with the
patient's primary hepatologist, who confirmed that the patient
was not a candidate for retransplantation. As the patient's
liver disease was believed to be a central factor in her
deteriorating condition, measures were transitioned towards
making the patient comfortable and prolonging her life only long
enough for her family members to be able to say goodbye. She
passed away peacefully with her family at her side.

CT Head without contrast ([**2107-6-26**]): No acute intracranial
process. Mild right sphenoidal sinus disease. Mild age advanced
atrophy. Please correlate clinically.

TTE ([**2107-6-28**])
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
37 year old female with past medical history of FSH producing
macroadenoma s/p TSS x 2 complicated by panhypopituitarism for
which she is on chronic prednisone and levothyroxine admitted
with hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypothermia and bradycardia
likely due to adrenal crisis.

1. Adrenal crisis: Unsure of the precipitant. Could be medical
noncompliance with past history even though patient and her
sister report compliance.  It could also be precipitated by
viral upper respiratory tract infection.  She was started on IV
hydrocortisone in the MICU and transitioned to prednisone 20 mg
po qdaily on discharge with help of endocrinology.

She was empirically started on Vancomcyin/Zosyn to cover for
bacterial infection precipitating adrenal crisis but they were
discontinued on day 3 as blood cultures were negative x 48 hours
and no source of infection noted on imaging and exam.  TTE, EKG
and cardiac enzymes did not reveal any cardiac pathology.

2. Hypernatremia: Likely due to central diabetes insipidus.
Sodium returned to [**Location 213**] with DDAVP admission and urine output
returend to  less than 200 cc/hr.  She was discharged on
scheduled 0.1 mg of DDAVP at bedtime.  She was also instructed
to drink to thirst.

3. Panhypoptituitarism s/p TSS x 2 for pituitary macroadenoma.
Continued on home levothyroxine 75 mcg po qdaily.
Glucocorticoid replacement as above.  Currently not on any
estrogen replacement which she could benefit from to prevent
osteoporosis.

4. Prolong QTc: Likely due to sinus bradycardia in setting of
electrolyte imbalance. She does not report chest pain.

5. FSH pituitary adenoma.  Follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21721**] in 1
week after discharge.  Defer to primary endocrinologist
regarding imaging to determine there are any signs of growth of
her adenoma

6. Abnormal affect: Per baseline per patient's sister. Unsure of
psychological component. Patient reports not being depressed or
having ahedonia. CT head showed age advanced atrophy.  She
refused to speak with social worker.

7. Anemia: Iron studies showing anemia of chronic disease with
concaminant iron deficiency anemia. S/p one unit of PRBC in
MICU.  She was started on iron sulfate 325 mg po qdaily with
retic count of 1.1 on discharge.

8. Hyperglycemia: Likely due to increased steroids. Was treated
with sliding scale insulin

Follow up for PCP/endocrinology
1. Taper steroids per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21721**]
2. Please consider estrogen replacement to help prevent
osteoporosis
3. Please consider MRI head to determine whether her diabetes
insipidus is related to growth in her macroadenoma.
4. Please check retic count 2 weeks after discharge ([**2107-7-15**])
to determine whether she has a response to iron sulfate

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after being found at home with
low blood pressure, low blood glucose and low heart rate thought
to be due to adrenal crisis.  You were admitted to the medical
intensive care unit and given stress dose steroids.

You were also noted to have high sodium levels which were
thought to be due to deficiency in another pituitary hormone
called vasopression.  You were started on a medication called
DESMOPRESSIN to replete this hormone which helped normalize your
sodium levels.

You were also started on iron as you were thought to be iron
deficient causing you to have low blood count.

FOLLOWING MEDICATION CHANGES WERE MADE TO YOUR MEDICAL REGIMEN
START Desmopressin 0.1 mg by mouth every night to help with your
sodium level and urinate less water
START IRON 325 mg by mouth once a day to help with your blood
count
INCREASE PREDNISONE to 20 mg by mouth every day until you see
Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **]

Please discuss with your endocrinologist regarding further
imaging of your brain with MRI to determine whether your
pituitary adenoma is increasing in size.

History of Present Illness:
80F with past medical of history of gastric ulcer, right
peroneal DVT in [**2111**] on indefinite anti-coagulation with
warfarin which has been held since [**2112-6-14**] in setting of
multiple admission to OSH for melanotic stools, PVD s/p multiple
lower extremity revascularization, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
presenting with one day history of vomiting blood x 1 and
melanotic stool x 5 who presents as a transfer from the MICU to
[**Hospital1 139**] B wards.

Briefly, she presented 2 days ago with hematemsis and melana x1
day and was sent in by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the ED, she was transfused 2U
pRBC (Hct 23 on admission, baseline 33).  She was admitted to
the ICU. Post transfusion Hct 29, then down to 27, another 1U
pRBC, then Hct 30. EGD showed gastric ulcers with likely recent
bleed, but no intervention was undertaken except for biopsies
which are still spending. GI service was consulted and
recommended [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI. She was Briefly electively intubated for
EGD for concerns of airway protection, then extubated without
complication. She has not been hypotensive since admision, and
atually was hypertensive to SBP200s due to discontinuing home BP
meds, and got IV labetalol. She has now been restarted on home
oral PO meds. Her stay in the ICU was unfortunately complicated
by a fever to 101.6- repeat CXR after extubation showed a
possible LLL infiltrate vs. effusion vs. atelectasis which was
suspicious for VAP and she was started on cefepime Vancomycin
today on [**10-14**]. Of note, she was scheduled for lower extremity
PVD revascularization, and the GI and vascular surgery services
have been coordinating her outpatient antiplatelet regimen in
the setting of this GI bleed
Pt is feeling well today and says she does not feel light
headed, dizzy, or fatigued. She reports no abdominal pain right
now. (States her presenting symptom other than hematemesis and
melena was only fatigue, no pain).

CXR PA And Lateral
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Small bilateral
pleural effusions
are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the
patient.
Bibasilar opacity is likely atelectasis larger on the left.
Pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
aorta is tortuous.

B.  Antrum biopsy:

    Focal minimal chronic inflammation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
80F with past medical of history of gastric ulcer, right
peroneal DVT in [**2111**] on indefinite anti-coagulation with
warfarin which has been held since [**2112-6-14**] in setting of
multiple admission to OSH for melanotic stools, PVD s/p multiple
lower extremity revascularization, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
presenting with upper GIB confirmed on EGD during this admission


# Upper GI bleed, gastric ulcers
Patient presented reporting signs and symptoms of upper GIB with
melanotic stool and hematemsis and was supported by significant
BUN/Cr dissociation. The patient underwent EGD which showed
multiple ulcers in the stomach with evidence of recent bleed.
She was transfused 3 U pRBCs during the admission- two in the ED
and one in the MICU, and put on IV PPI and sucralfate.  Patient
was hemodynamically stable throughout with and hematocrits held
around 30.

#VAP/Hypoxia
She developed a fever in the MICU,  and given that it was 24 hrs
after intubtation with question of an infiltrate on CXR, she was
started on cefepime and vancomycin which she received for 24
hrs.  These meds were d/ced on the floor as repeat CXR did not
show good evidence of pneumonia and she did not look clinically
infected. She was treated empirically with Vancomycin 75 mg q 12
and Cefepime 1 g q 12 hr.  A repeat CXR PA and Lateral was
obtained which was not impressive for an infiltrate- the patient
remained asymptomatic and afebrile so the abx were discontinued
at 24 hrs.  However, on exam the patient was noted to have
crackles about halfway up on both lung fields.  She was given a
one time IV dose of lasix and restarted on her home regimen.
Her oxygen requirements were optimized by the time of discharge
and she was on her home lasix regimen.

#Drug-induced Pancytopenia
Patient has had thrombocytopenia on past labs of uncertain
etiology.  She was noted to have downtrending WBCs to 1.6 by [**10-15**]
and was technically still anemic.  A smear noted some occasional
schistocytes but hemolysis labs were negative.  Hematology was
consulted and thought the vancomycin or cefepime was causing
marrow toxicity.  She was monitored for the next few days until
her counts began to increase.  They went up to WBC 2.6 21%
neutrophils (ANC still below 1000).  Per heme recs she was given
1 dose of neupogen.  Her CBC then increased to WBC 7.1 with
almost 70% neutrophils.  She was discharged with close follow up
with her hematologist.Her CBC was closely monitored during her
hospital stay.

# Hypertension
The patient's home blood pressure medications were held when
admitted to the ICU for concern of GIB.  She actually became
hypertensive during this time.  Upon arrival to the floor her
home BP meds were restarted as below.  She remained stable,
although with an episode of overnight hypertension 2 days prior
to discharge.
- diovan 320 mg PO qD
- labetalol 100 mg PO TID
- nidefipine ER 60 mg PO qD

#PVD: Patient was originally scheduled to have a revision of a
previous vascular surgery during the time frame of her
admission.  This was obviously postponed, but the issue of her
anticoagulation remained.  She had a prior DVT which she takes
warfarin for but this has been held since [**Month (only) 116**] due to recurrent
GI bleeds.  The vascular surgery team expressed they would like
her anticoagulated for her PVD.  After consulting with both GI
and Vascular it was decided that she could go out on plavix, and
hold aspirin given her risk of rethrombosis in her vascular
stents combined with the stability of the bleed.


# Acute renal insufficiency
Patient has baseline Cr ~ 0.7 with admission Cr 1, which came
down to 0.9- no issues since admission

CHRONIC ISSUES

# Chronic back pain
- continued tramadol prn

# Hyperlipidemia
- continued statin, ezetimibe

# History of DVT
- We held warfarin as above

Transitional Issues
-She will follow up with hematology in 3 days for repeat cbc.
-Patient has blood cultures and urine cultures that need follow
up
-She should also be optimized on home BP meds for better
hypertension control

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs [**Known lastname 68391**],

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for
melanotic stools and hematemesis and were found to have an upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  You were given 2 units of blood in the
emergency department and then transferred to the ICU and given 1
unit of blood.  The gastroenterologists took you down for an
endoscopy which showed a recently bleeding ulcer- they took
biopsies of it which showed inflammation- there was no other
intervention performed.  You were briefly given antibiotics for
pneumonia but were taken off after 24 hrs treatment.  Your WBCs
were noted to be abnormally low and a hematology consult was
obtained.  It was thought that either the vancomycin or cefepime
caused your low blood counts.  We watched them for a few days
and they struggled to increase.  You received one dose of
neupogen, which helps stimulate the bone marrow, and were
cleared for discharge as your WBC increased to 7.1 with almost
60% neutrophils.

The following changes have been made to your medications:

It was a pleasure taking care of you while at [**Hospital1 18**]

History of Present Illness:
68 year old man with a history of coronary disease status post
cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs since then presenting on the [**7-7**]
with weight gain at home and altered mental status resulting in
a fall at home. In the ED he had a possible seizure with
dilantin loading. He became hypotensive after that and went to
MICU. He was then sent to the medicine service for several days
working up neurologic issues and falls. Then the patient began
having chest pain, echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from
45->20% and some apical and septal akinesis. Cath showed severe
native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA. RHC showed elevated
wedge at 30mmHg. RA pressures 25 and PAP 73. CI 1.5. Then
transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management.
.
Patient was given 80mg IV lasix given last night and this
morning still volume overloaded and given another 100mg IV lasix
and metolazone and lasix gtt. Team is concerned for poor forward
flow given LFTs have increased to >1000, creatinine to 3.3, INR
>2, and only 600mL UOP with 20mg/hr lasix gtt yesterday.
.
At this point, he was transferred to the HF service and admitted
to the CCU for inotropes, swan, and lasix drip. If
non-responsive to this will need IABP.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient appears somewhat lethargic and
uncomfortable but is conversant.  He endorses discomfort around
his foley site but denies cough, chest pain, sob, abdominal
symptoms, fevers/chills.

STUDIES:
[**2120-7-6**] CT Head w/o contrast- No acute intracranial process
[**2120-7-6**] C Spine w/o contrast- No acute fractures or
malalignment
[**2120-7-6**] CXR Portable AP- Midline sternotomy wires are again
noted.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted with probable
basilar atelectasis.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Heart size is
top
normal.  No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural
effusions with basilar atelectasis.
[**2120-7-6**] CT Abd/Pelvis-IMPRESSION: 1.  Nonspecific mesenteric
stranding and small amount of fluid in the abdomen could be
secondary to generalized third spacing. 2.  Chronic loculated
left sided pleural fluid collection/chronic empyema is stable.
3.  Gallstones and sludge within the gallbladder.
[**2120-7-8**] EEG- This is an abnormal waking EEG because of diffuse
polymorphic arrhythmic theta and delta activity. This background
activity improves to theta range activity on stimulation. These
findings are suggestive of moderate encephalopathy but of
nonspecific cause. There are no epileptiform discharges or focal
abnormalities seen.
[**2120-7-10**] MRI Head w and w/o contrast- 1.  No acute intracranial
abnormality. 2.  No pathologic focus of enhancement or anatomic
substrate for seizure. 3.  Relatively mild global atrophy.
4.  Chronic inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses;
correlate clinically.
.
[**2120-7-11**] Portable TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the septum and apex; the rest of the
left ventricle appears hypokinetic with regional variation. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the findings of the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-5-19**], left ventricular
systolic function is significantly further compromised.
.
[**2120-7-12**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel
disease in the right dominant system The LMCA had a patent stent
with mild in stent restenosis, there was a 30-40% distal LMCA
stenosis beyond the distal edge of the LMCA stent which was
unchanged from prior. The LAD had diffuse severe disease
proximally and occludes at the mid vessel after a tiny diagonal
branch. The Cx had diffuse disease throughout with serial focal
50% stenoses. The RCA had an ostial 80% stenosis which was
heavily calcified. There was also an 80% heavily calcified 80%
stenosis in the mid RCA. Diffuse mild to moderate disease was
seen throughout the rest of the RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
sided filling pressure with an RVEDP of 24 mmHg and an LVEDP of
26 mmHg. There was pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of
73/35 mmHg. The cardiac index was depressed at 1.55 L/min/m2.
The central aortic pressure was 120/73 mmHg. Upon careful
pullback of a pigtail catheter from the LV to the aorta no
pressure gradient was seen.
3. Arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA which
supplied a diffusely diseased LAD. The SVGs were not engaged as
they were known to be occluded.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a
3.5x26mm INTEGRITY stent which was postdilated proximally to
4.0mm. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA
comments).
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a 3.5x12mm
INTEGRITY stent which was postdilated to 3.5mm. Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
6. Successful closure of the 6 French right femoral arteriotomy
site with a 6 French ANGIOSEAL VIP device with good resultant
hemostasis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate to severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a BMS.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a BMS.
6. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
an Angioseal device.
.
[**2120-7-15**] EEG:
Abnormal EEG due to a low voltage slow background throughout.
This indicates a widespread encephalopathy. Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are the most common
causes. Ischemia or hypoxia are other possibilities. There were
no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may
obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features or
electrographic seizures.
.
[**2120-7-15**] CT abdomen & pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic hematoma detected.
2.  Circulatory assist device within the abdominal aorta.
3.  Persistent bilateral nephrograms, compatible with severe
renal failure, as the last contrast-enhanced study was performed
on [**2120-7-10**].
4.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2120-7-19**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior,
and inferolateral walls and distal anterior, lateral and apical
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 25-30
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive
regional systolic dysfunction most c/w multivessel CAD
(including proximal RCA). Right ventricular cavity enlargement.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-7-11**],
global left ventricular systolic function is slightly improved.
.
[**2120-7-20**] KUB:
1) No dilated loops of large or small bowel to suggest
obstruction or ileus. No obvious free air identified.
2) Multiple clustered locules of air in the right mid abdomen
may represent stool within the colon in an area of prior surgery
and are similar to the appearance on the [**2120-7-7**] abdominal CT.
However, the differential diagnosis for this appearance includes
air within an abscess.  If there is significant clinical
suspicion for intra-abdominal infection, then this area could be
further assessed with a CT scan.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: 68 year old man with a history of coronary
disease status post cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs, DM type II,
hypertension and depression who presented initially on [**2120-7-7**]
with weight gain at home and altered mental status.  He had what
appeared to be a possible seizure in the ED, resulting in
dilantin loading and subsequent hypotension requiring transfer
to the MICU. He was then sent to the medicine service for
several days while work up continued on his neurologic issues
and falls (work up negative). Then on [**2120-7-11**], he began having
chest pain, and echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from
45->20% with some apical and septal akinesis. Cath the following
day showed severe native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA, and
RHC showed elevated wedge at 30mmHg. He was intitially
transferred back to the cardiology service for management,
however he became increasingly volume overloaded with end organ
dysfunction (renal and liver failure) suggestive of cardiogenic
shock, necessitating transfer to the CCU under the heart failure
service.
.
CCU Course:  On arrival patient was started on inotropes,
pulmonary artery catheter was placed, and intra-aortic balloon
pump was initiated for support for his cardiogenic shock.  Given
his renal failure, CVVH was initiated (mostly for
ultrafiltration).  Despite full support with intermittent
pressors, IABP, and CVVH, he failed to improve.  On [**2120-7-17**], he
self-discontinued his balloon pump, leading to rapid
decompensation necessitating urgent intubation and transfer to
the cath lab for IABP re-placement.  He was able to wean off the
balloon pump on [**2120-7-19**], however his hemodynamics then worsened
again, necessitating the use of pressors.  Despite full pressor
support, his status continued to worsen.  Upon frank discussion
with his family regarding his grim prognosis, they felt that he
would never want to continue with aggressive care if there was
little chance of full recovery.  On [**2120-7-21**], they decided to
transition his care to comfort measures only.  He died
peacefully on [**2120-7-22**].
.
Please see below for details on each of his major active issues:
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# [**Date Range 7792**]/Cardiogenic Shock: On [**2120-7-11**] while on medicine
service, experienced chest pain with troponin of 0.1, negative
MB, but echo with new anterior WMA and EF depressed at 25% (down
from 40-45%).  Cath on [**7-12**] showed 80% ostial stenosis of the
RCA, which was stented with 2 bare metal stents.  Following the
cath, he continued to decompensate.  He appeared to be in
decompensated CHF by renal status, crackles on exam, and mild
peripheral edema.  A TTE showed an EF of 20% from baseline of
40-45% in 6/[**2118**].  He had 2 BMS placed to his RCA, his LVEDP was
elevatd at 30, pulmonary pressures were also elevated so the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service. Despite aggresive
diuresis, patient continued to [**Last Name (un) 22977**] clinically, with high
filling pressures, low CI, low UOP and was transfered to CCU.
Patient was started on dobutamine for inotropic effect (could
not do milranone because of [**Last Name (un) **]). He was also on lasix drip.
Patient had an intra-aortic baloon pump to improve systemic
perfusion and coronary artery perfusion.
.
While in CCU a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to monitor CO.
Dobutamine drip was started in setting of low CO. The patient
was also started on CVVH to remove fluid thought to be
contributing to decreased CO as renal failure persisted. On [**7-17**]
pt was increasingly delusional and removed his IABP partially.
Decision was made to remove pump at this time and heparin ggt
d/c and pressure held at site. The patient's o2 sats decreased
at this time and lactate increased to over 6. Decision was made
to intubate and transfer to cath lab for replacement of pump.
Ballon pump was weaned off of IABP on [**7-19**]. Howver he conintued
to have high pressor requirements.
.
#.Acute on Chronic [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.5, on
admission 2.2.  However after the drop in his blood pressure and
after his cath his Cr continued to rise and he stopped making
urine.  Renal was consulted who started CCVH to remove fluid to
help relieve strain on his heart.  CCVH was stopped when patient
was made CMO by family on [**7-21**].
.
#Transaminitis - On transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**] service, patients LFTs had
noted to increase to ALT 117, AST 418.  The day following cath,
his LFTs sharply rose to ALT 1200 and AST 1059, LDH 1900, TBili
1.9.  Concern was for shock liver vs med effect, Hepatology was
consulted who felt this was due to shock liver - they rec'd to
hold atorvastatin, obtain RUQ U/S which showed possibly fatty
liver with patent vasculature.  The following day, he developed
encephalopathy and lactulose was started. LFTs trended down
throughout his hospital course.
.
#.Fall at Home- His initial insult was a well-described
mechanical fall from slipping on mineral oil, and he did not
endorse symptoms consistent with vasovagal syncope. We also
considered orthostasis given history of same vs. arrhythmia vs.
seizure given possible seizure in CT scan. Patient was not found
to be orthostatic. Neurology consulted and had a low suspicion
of seizure. MRI with and without contrast was unremarkable.
Neurology continued to follow and did not recommend AED's.
.
IDDM: Patient was kep on insulin sliding scale and hi blood
surgars well well ontrolled in the CCU.
.
Goals of Care dicussion: On [**7-21**]: Family meeting was held with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]??????[**Doctor Last Name **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4402**], SW [**Doctor First Name **], and patient??????s family
including:  wife [**Name (NI) **], daughter [**Name (NI) 12983**], daughter [**Name (NI) 22978**], and
sister [**Name (NI) **].  They were updated on the patient??????s grim
prognosis and his continued decline despite maximal support.
The family was in agreement that per past discussions they had
with the patient, he would not have wanted a prolonged death and
would rather be made comfortable at this juncture.  In light of
this, Mr [**Known lastname **]??????s goal of care was focused on comfort only, with
cessation of all supportive measures including pressors, CVVH,
and the ventilator. After withdawal of all care he passed away
on [**2120-7-22**] at 7:10am.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 73yo male with CAD s/p CABG or STENT?, Hodgkins
Lymphoma, recent admission in [**Month (only) 116**] for extensive bilateral
femoral vein clots, who presents with dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia,
found to have b/l pulmonary embolisms.
Of note, this patient was admitted to oncology from [**Date range (1) **]
for bilateral DVTs of common femoral, superficial femoral,
politeal,
and calf veins. At that time, he was started Dalteparin
(Fragmin) daily for treatment of this. He reports that he had
been compliant with this.
The patient reports that he has been feeling short of breath for
several months. When he left the hospital last [**Month (only) 116**], he was short
of breath, and this has been worsening since then. He reports
that his excercise tolerance has worsened progressively since
being discharged from the hospital. He feels short of breath
with mininal exertion. He also reports coughing nightly for the
past few days. This morning, he ""just couldnt take it anymore""
and decided to come in. He denies any acute worsening in his
breathing, and reports that it has been progressive.
On review of systems. He denies chest pain, palpations. has
cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion. denies fevers.
reports chills and feeling cold all of the time. reports 10
pounds of unintentional recent weight loss. all other review of
systems negative.
In the ER, intial vitals were 103/43, HR 96, RR 22, O2sat 77% on
RA. Reportedly altered when hypoxic, but mental status improved
once on oxygen. A CTA was done showing clot in right main
pulmonary artery and branch arteries in the LLL. He was started
on heparin. He also remains hypoxemic. Attempt was made to put
him in 6l NC, but he became tachpyneic and [**Last Name (LF) 52536**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] is now

1. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities most
likely represent infection or inflammation; however, the
differential diagnosis also includes pulmonary edema,
hemorrhage, or superimposed infarction.
2. Stable mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Persistent pulmonary embolism involving the right main
pulmonary artery
extending into the right middle and lower lobes but with no
evidence of right heart strain.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated compressive
atelectasis.
5. Subcentimeter lesion in segment I/VI of the liver, too small
to
characterize, but may represents a hepatic cyst. Recommend
attention on
followup.
6. Clots in left external iliac vein, right common femoral, and
left common femoral veins.
7. Hypodensity in the upper pole of the right kidney is most
consistent with a renal cyst. Bilateral hypodensities are too
small to characterize but likely represent renal cysts.

Brief Hospital Course:
When patient came to the ED on [**2148-7-31**], his initial intial
vitals were 103/43, HR 96, RR 22, O2sat 77% on RA. He was
altered when hypoxic, but mental status improved once on oxygen.
A CTA was done showing clot in right main pulmonary artery and
branch arteries in the LLL. He was started on heparin.  Attempt
was made to put him in 6 L NC, but he became tachpyneic and
[**Last Name (LF) 52536**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he went back on a non-rebreather. He was then
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Chief Complaint:
headache, nauesa/vomiting, vertigo

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cerebellar lesion resection x2
EVD
VPS placement

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 63-year-old RH woman with a history of non-small
cell
lung CA (stage IIIa, s/p chemo, XRT, and L upper lobectomy), PE
35 yrs ago, rheumatic fever in childhood, prior tobacco use who
presents with headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and blurry
vision for the last 2 weeks. She reports a holocephalic
headache,
extending from the back of her head up to the front bilaterally
starting about 2 weeks ago. The headache is constant, not
throbbing, and worsens with any movement particularly when she
stands up. It does not seem to worsen with lying down and has
not
woken her from sleep. She says she used to get migraines but has
not had one in years; thinks this headahce feels somewhat
similar
but is atypical in its duration. In addition she has has
worsening nausea with vomiting, and for the last two days has
not
been able to keep anything down. She has also noticed that her
vision appears ""cloudy"" over the last week and a half. Upon
further questioning she says she thinks it appears double
sometimes but is unsure if the images are vertically or
horizontally displaced. She has not tried covering one eye to
see
if it improves. She is not sure if it is worse when looking
toward one direction or the other. Currently her vision seems a
little blurry but denies diplopia at the moment.

Within the last two days she has also begun to experience
dizziness, which she describes as the room spinning. She has
also
had difficulty walking and says she feels very unsteady on her
feet. Unsure if she is falling toward one side or the other. She
came into the ED today because she was continuing to feel worse
and was unable to keep down anything by mouth.

On neuro ROS, the pt reports headache, blurred/double vision,
vertigo, difficulty walking as above. Denies difficulty
speaking,
loss of vision, focal weakness, numbness/tingling,  bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention.

On general review of systems, the pt reports frequent chills but
does not think she has had any fevers. Denies recent weight loss
or gain. Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain
or
tightness, palpitations. +Nausea/vomiting, no abdominal pain.
has
not had a bowel movement over the last few days which she
attributes to not eating. No dysuria. Denies rash.

Past Medical History:

CT head noncontrast [**2-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Two new posterior cranial fossa/cerebellar lesions, with
surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle,
concerning for metastatic disease.
2. A new 1.1 cm mass lesion in the third ventricle, with mild
hydrocephalus, concerning for additional site of metastatic
disease. An MRI with contrast is recommended for further
evaluation.

CT head with contrast [**2-22**]:
1. Right cerebellar and third ventricle lesions are new from
[**2166-8-18**],
concerning for metastatic disease. If clinically feasible, MRI
is more
sensitive to detect small lesions and leptomeningeal disease.
2. The lateral ventricles are slightly enlarged compared to
[**2166-8-18**],
raising the possibility of mild hydrocephalus due to third
ventricle lesion.

MRI with and without contrast [**2-23**]:
Supra- and infra-tentorial as well as intraventricular
metastatic
disease, notably involving the left insular cortex, right
cerebellar
hemisphere, and third ventricle.
While the right cerebellar lesion is associated with significant
mass effect and distortion of the fourth ventricle, there is
currently no CSF obstruction or hydrocephalus. The third
ventricle lesion is located below the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] and
likewise does not cause hydrocephalus.

MRI C/T spine [**2-24**]
1. Compression fracture, with mild loss of height of the
Thoracic T5
vertebral body with marrow edema pattern. No retropulsion of the
fragments,
no canal or compression on the cord. While this has the
appearance of a
benign compression fracture, given the history, an associated
pathologic
lesion within the T5 body cannot be completely excluded.
Correlation with
radionuclide studies and CT is recommended. No enhancing lesions
in the cord.

2. Multilevel mild degenerative changes in the cervical spine
without
significant canal or foraminal stenosis.

3. A 3.3 x 3.5 cm nodular lesion in the lower neck/upper
mediastinum, new
since the prior CT chest of [**2166-11-27**]. This needs further
evaluation with CT chest, including the lower neck. There is
moderate amount of pleural
effusion/pleural thickening noted on the left side.

MRI [**Doctor Last Name **] [**2-26**] FINDINGS: Since the prior study, the patient has
undergone biopsy of the
right cerebellar hemispheric lesion. Expected postoperative
change are seen
with relatively extensive intralesional hemorrhage and a
circumscribed tissue
defect. The previously reported extensive vasogenic edema as
well as mass
effect on the fourth ventricle is largely unchanged.

The previously reported additional metastatic lesions within the
left insular cortex and third ventricle demonstrate no short
interval change. However, with less motion artefact and better
image quality further lesions measuringapproximately 3 mm are
identified in the posterior aspect of the left temporal [**Month/Day (4) 3630**] as
well as the left cerebellar hemisphere.

There is no evidence of acute infarction. Flow voids of the
major
intracranial vessels are preserved.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post biopsy of right cerebellar mass with expteced
intralesional
hemorrhage.

2. No short-term interval change with regard to the left insular
cortex and third ventricle metastatic lesions.

3. Identification of additional small lesions within the left
posterior
temporal cortex as well as the left posterior medial cerebellar
hemisphere.

[**2-27**] CT FINDINGS: Patient is status post a right-sided
ventriculostomy catheter with tip terminating in the frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right ventricle. No associated intraparencymal or
intraventricular hemorrhage identified. Ventricles demonstrate
stable mild dilatation, unchanged from the prior CT.

The patient is status post a right suboccipital craniotomy with
partial
resection of a known right cerebellar mass. Again there is a
small amount of air and expected post-surgical hematoma at the
site of the recent surgical intervention in the posterior
cranial fossa with an increasingly hypodense appearance
consistent with evolution of blood products. A 2.8 x 2.3 cm
rounded hyperdense mass most suggestive of residual tumor,
better identified on the prior MRI, and is located just superior
to the resection site and unchanged. Known left insular cortical
mass is not well seen, and better evaluated on the MRI.
Surrounding vasogenic edema in the cerebellar
hemispheres persists but with minimally improved mass effect on
the patent
fourth ventricle. The known 1.1 x 1.0 cm hyperdense mass in the
third
ventricle is unchanged. No new parenchymal hematoma or infarct
present. The mastoid air cells, middle ear cavities and
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post partial resection of the right cerebellar mass
with a stable distribution of surrounding vasogenic edema though
with a slight decreased mass effect on the widely patent fourth
ventricle. Continued evolution of blood products within
post-surgical hematoma. Residual tumor as described above.
2. Interval placement of a right-sided ventriculostomy catheter
with tip in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. No intraparenchymal or
intraventricular hemorrhage identified. Stable mild dilatation
of bilateral lateral ventricles.

[**2-27**] CT ABD
FINDINGS: There is a new left paratracheal mass measuring 3.8 x
3.4 x 2.2 cm causing mild deviaiton of the trachea and left
carotid artery concerning for a lymphadenopathy due to
metastasis. There is no , axillary, mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy evident. The central vessels are unremarkable.
Heart size is normal and without pericardial effusion. A small-
to moderate-sized hiatal hernia is evident. There is a small
left pleural effusion with thickened rind evident at the level
of the upper [**Month/Day (4) 3630**], indicating chronicity.  Pleural blebs are
identified within the right lung apex. No significant
emphysematous changes are identified. Changes consistent with
left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection are
evident. Nonspecific ground-glass opacities with minimal
associated architectural distortion identified in the left lung
apex are increased compared to prior study and likely represent
post-radiation changes. Minimal dependent atelectasis in
dependent portions of both lungs.

The liver is homogenous in attenuation without discrete masses
or lesions.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen are normal. The bilateral
adrenal glands have normal limb thickness and are without convex
margin to suggest mass. The bilateral kidneys are normal in size
and excrete contrast symmetrically. The stomach, small and large
bowel are unremarkable. There is no retroperitoneal, mesenteric
or portacaval lymphadenopathy identified. Multiple small foci of
air are noted within the abdomen as well as a layering posterior
to the left rectus sheath muscle, likely due to recent insertion
of a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt with tip ending
lateral to the liver. No free fluid identified within the
abdomen. The rectum, bladder, uterus and adnexa are
unremarkable. No pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy
identified.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout. The main
portal vein and its major tributaries are unremarkable.

No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions evident.

IMPRESSION:
1. New 3.8 cm left paratracheal mass concerning for metastasis.
2. Expected post-surgical changes in the left upper [**Month/Day (4) 3630**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED on [**2167-2-21**] following 2 weeks of
headaches, nausea/vomiting, and vertigo. CT head demonstrated a
large mass in the R cerebellum and a smaller lesion in the third
ventricle. Neurosurgery was consulted in the ED and declined
acute intervention. She was started on Decadron 4mg Q6 and
admitted to the neuro-ICU for monitoring. She did well overnight
without any evidence of hydrocephalus or increasing ICP, and her
symptoms began to improve. She was transferred to the neurology
floor on [**2167-2-22**].

MRI with and without contrast was performed which demonstrated
three lesions, largest in R cerebellar hemisphere as well as two
additional masses in third ventricle and left insula.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and recommended resection of
cerebellar lesion and whole brain radiation.
Her primary oncologists Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 11309**] were also
contact[**Name (NI) **].
Neurosurgery recommended suboccipital craniectomy followed by
VPS placement.

On [**2167-2-24**]: she had increased nausea and headaches. She was taken
to the OR and underwent resection of her cerebellar mass. She
tolerated the procedure well. Post operatively she returned to
the ICU for SBP control and neurochecks. Her exam remained
stable and post operative head CT showed no hemorrhage. On [**2-25**]
she was transferred to the floor. On [**2-26**] she had a routine head
CT for preoperative planning and this showed no change from
previous scans. She was kept NPO after midnight for VPS
placement on [**2-27**].

On [**2167-2-27**]: she was taken to the operating room for VP shunt
placement. She tolerated the procedure well. Post-operatively
she returned to the floor.

Postop MRI demonstrated residual cerebellar tumor and so on [**3-4**]
she returned to the OR for craniotomy for excision of residual
tumor.

On [**3-5**], patient was doing well, having some hallunications, but
knows that they are hallunications. Her decadron was tappered
and she was transferred to the floor. Her exam remains stable;
SQH was started as well.

CV:
She was maintained on telemetry monitoring throughout her
admission.

ENDO:
She was maintained on finger sticks QID and insulin sliding
scale while being treated with steroids.

FEN:

On [**2129-3-20**], the patient's Coumadin was held, and the patient
was started on Heparin in preparation for an endoscopy to
further evaluate her anemia.  Per report, the endoscopy did
not discover any etiology for her guaiac-positive stools or
anemia.  The patient became very insistent on leaving after
having endoscopy, which did not further elucidate the anemia.
After discussion, the team decided to discharge the patient
home with VNA earlier than expected.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Coronary artery disease status post three-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft.
3. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter.

IMAGING:
Head CT 8/18(6am):
There is extraaxial (likely subdural) hemorrhage within the left
posterior
fossa inferior, lateral and posterior to the cerebellum with
mass effect on the left cerebellar hemisphere narrowing the
fourth ventricle. Blood tracks along the tentorium and into the
left cerebellopontine angle.
There is a small amount of blood within the dependent aspect of
the left
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is dilatation of the lateral ventricles
and dilatation of the temporal horns bilaterally, consistent
with mild degree of hydrocephalus. The suprasellar cistern and
basal cisterns are grossly patent. There is no definite
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation abnormality. Subcortical and
periventricular foci of hypoattenuation are likely related to
microvascular ischemic chronic changes. The patient is status
post bilateral cataract surgery. Intracranial vascular
calcifications are noted. There is no depressed skull fracture.
The
visualized mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are grossly
clear. There is right nasal septum deviation, morphology favors
chronic finding with no acute fracture noted.
IMPRESSION:
Posterior fossa extra-axial hematoma, most likely subdural.
Intraventricular hemorrhage. Mild hydrocephalus. Mild mass
effect on the cerebellum with narrowing of the fourth ventricle.
No definite herniation at this time.

Head CT 8/18(6pm):
FINDINGS: The hemorrhage in the left posterior fossa appears
similar to the prior exam approximately eight hours earlier.
There appears to be a subdural collection forming along the
cerebellopontine angle which is similar to prior exam. There is
blood in the left lateral ventricle layering dependently again
unchanged from prior examination. There is dilation of the
lateral ventricles and temporal horns which is unchanged. The
third ventricle is enlarged with effacement of the fourth
ventricle, not significantly different from prior examination.
There is a similar amount of left to right shift in the
cerebellum. There are low lying cerebellar tonsils. There does
not appear to be any new areas of hemorrhage. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. There
is no osseous abnormality identified. There are periventricular
and deep white matter hypodensities consistent with
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There are prominent sulci
consistent with age-related changes. There is a possible osteoma
in the right sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**].
IMPRESSION: Similar amount of left posterior fossa hemorrhage
with mass
effect. There is a similar amount of left to right shift and
low-lying
cerebellar tonsils without definite herniation. Recommend
continued close
follow-up.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the ED  with positive head CT for ICH
we reversed INR by using Profiline and FFP as the patient takes
warfarin. The patient was noted to have coffee ground emesis she
was given given pantoprazole 40 mg IV her hematocrit was 31. She
was admitted to the SICU and had serial crits which remained
stable. Her head CT were done frequently X2 which showed no
change. Her BP parameters were kept less  SBP<140. She remained
neurologically stable and was transferred to the step down area
on [**9-5**]. she continued to have guaiac positive stools. [**9-6**] Head
Ct revealed decrease blood. She developed some right knee pain
and bilateral leg pain on palpation, LENIs were negative for dvt
and plain film of knee negative for fracture or effusion. The
patient had no further episodes of emesis. She was able to
tolerate a ground diet. Neurologically she was: alert and
oriented to self, she is able to follow commands. Bilateral
upper extremities full strength and antigravity with lower
extremities.

A drop in her Na level was noted. The patient was started on PO
salt tabs on [**9-9**], and her Na came up nicely to 133.  At the
time of discharge we are recommending daily Na checks with a
fluid restriction of 750cc/day.

If Na should continue to drop, it may be beneficial to add Salt
tabs, and or to send urine electrolytes to asses the cause of
her hyponatremia.

Pertinent Results:
[**12-8**] Carotids
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries. Minimal plaque was identified.  On the right, peak
systolic velocities are 62, 66, 66 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 0.9. This is consistent
with no stenosis.  On the left, peak systolic velocities are 59,
54, 73 in the ICA, CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio
is 1.1. This is consistent with no stenosis.  There is antegrade
flow in both vertebral arteries.

[**12-10**] abdominal u/s:
FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture without focal
lesions. Gallbladder contains several layering stones without
signs of cholecystitis. Common bile duct is normal in diameter
measuring 0.4 cm. The pancreas is unremarkable. The aorta is
normal in diameter. The right kidney measures 10.1 cm in length.
There is a caliceal diverticulum in the upper pole containing
calcium with an additional 0.6 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm simple cyst. The
spleen is normal in size measuring 10.2 cm.

[**2194-12-12**] Liver needle biopsy:
   1) Mild portal chronic, predominantly mononuclear cell,
inflammation.
   2) Focal, mild steatosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery service under the
care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Given his low platelet counts (74) at
[**Hospital1 **] and at [**Hospital1 18**], a hematology consult was obtained for
further evaluation.  His thrombocytopenia had been previously
documented and worked up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30843**].  An abdominal ultrasound
showed no signs of splenomegaly and his heparin-dependent
antibody assay was negative.  In addition, the Hepatology team
was asked to evaluate Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] for his thrombocytopenia in the
presence of HCV.  On [**12-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an
ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.  The results were mild portal
chronic, predominantly mononuclear cell, inflammation; and
focal, mild steatosis.

Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] was cleared for surgery by the Hematology and
Hepatology teams.  His chronic thrombocytopenia was attributed
to either ITP or HCV.  He received platelet transfusions
pre-operatively.  On [**12-18**], he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] his CABG x1 and AVR
without complications.  Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 5572**] Operative Note
for further detail.

Post-operatively, he did well.  He was extubated, his chest
tubes removed, and transferred to the floor by POD #2.  His
platelet and hematocrit levels were closely followed.  By the
time of discharge on POD #5, his epicardial wires were removed,
he was evaluated by physical therapy, had good pain control, and
was tolerating a regular diet, although complained of poor
appetite.  His Coumadin was restarted on [**12-20**] for his atrial
fibrillation.

Chief Complaint:
Rash/Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
51 year old female h/o metastatic melanoma s/p ICH and placement
of VP shunt presented [**1-24**] with fever and rash. On [**1-2**]
patient had left hemiplegia and HA, was diagnosed with ICH from
metastatic melanoma.  Underwent emergent craniotomy for
evacuation of bleed and tumor rescetion, she was also started on
dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. She then developed
hydrocephalus and had VP shunt placed on [**1-6**] and repeat VP
shunt operation on [**1-14**] secondary to her failure at clamping
trials. Prior to discharge she was noted to be febrile to 103 on
[**11-13**] temp spiked to 101.5 with a productive cough,
influenza was negative so she was discharged on levofloxacin,
completed course [**1-21**]. Three sets of blood cultures and urine
culture negative.  She also developed a diffuse morbiliform
eruption rash after dilantin was started.  However, Dilantin was
continued since the benefits of sizure prophylaxis outweighed
risks of continuing medicaitons.  After discharge her fever
resolved but the rash did not.  She used Sarna lotion and
benadryl at home, but noted spread of the rash from truck
outwards to extremities, sparing face palms and soles.
.
On day of admission ([**1-23**]) she developed a high fever with
chills and was brought to [**Hospital3 3583**], and was then
transfered here for further care.  Upon arrival to the ED the
patient recieved 125 mg
Solumedrol, 50 mg IV Benadryl, 1 gram tylenol, Motrin 800 mg and

4 liters of normal saline. Her fever initially was >104.8
rectally (107 temporal) but trended down to 99.1.  Got CXR,
cultures, urine and shunt tapped.  ID was consulted who
recommended holding on Abx given lack of source, did not feel
that VP fluid cell count was indicative of shunt infection, more
likely blood.  Dermatology was also consulted.

Imaging:
CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT head:
1. Interval evolution of encephalomalacia and decrease of blood
products at prior sites of hemorrhage.
2. Slight increase in right frontal subdural low density
collection.
3. Stable ventriculostomy catheter location with no interval
development of hydrocephalus.

CT abd/pelv:
1. Interval VP shunt placement, with no adjacent fluid
collection. No
evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Left adrenal adenoma, unchanged.
3. Small amount of pelvic free fluid, fluid in the endometrial
cavity, and a small amount of air in the bladder may relate to
recent LEEP procedure.
4. Increase in size of left buttock subcutaneous nodule, highly
concerning for metastatic disease in this patient with known
melanoma.
5. Right paramedian Bartholin gland cyst with tiny dependent
stone; less likely urethral diverticulum.

EKG: Sinus tach

Brief Hospital Course:
Initially transferred to MICU for closer monitoring for
development vessicles/bullae or mucosal involvment.  Stable
overnight.  Developed fever to 104 following morning with HR in
the 130s, which improved with fluids, acetaminophen and motrin.
Dilantin held and Keppra started for seizure [**Last Name (LF) 9401**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 724**].

#Rash: Most likely hypersensitivity reaction (DRESS) from
dilantin vs famotidine.  Both were held.  Concerned for SJS
initially, however rash did not appear to involve mucosa or
palms/soles, and no bullae.  Also considered toxic shock
syndrome initially w/ fever and rash, but no tampon use.  No
evidence of meningitis given neck supple, no headache, CSF fluid
does not appear infected, no fluid around abdominal portion of
VP shunt. Seen by dermatology who recommended clobetasol,
hydrocortisone cream, steroids as well as benadryl, Sarna and
atarax.  Rash remained stable, not spreading and perhaps slighty
improving. Her fever decreased and she was able to tolerate PO.
LFTs trending down, Cr stable, but she had a persistant
eosinophilia. Per derm, rash likely to last for several weeks
prior to resolution.  Will follow up with dermatology as an
outpatient.
.
#Fever: Most likely drug reaction.  Infection considered,
however no localizing signs of infection and no sick contacts.
Cultures negative.  No Abx given. Flu negative. Given
acetaminophen and motrin as well as IVF. Temperature trended
down and had normalized at time of discharge.
.
# Tachycardia: Persistant in 90-100s, fluid responsive,
improving when afebrile.  Likely [**3-15**] insensible losses from
fever and rash.  Encouaged PO fluids on discharge, fever control
and close followup.
.
#Malignant melanoma: s/p ICH w/ multiple mets to brain. No
current e/o neurologic defict other than left facial droop
likely residual from previous ICH.  Will follow up as
outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in the hospital for a fever and rash that is
likely due to the dilantin you were prescribed for seizure
propalaxis.  You were evaluated by the dermatology team and
given steroids and medication to decrease itching.  It is
important to drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration with your
fever.  The rash might worsene before it gets better and it is
possible your skin will slough off as it heals.

You should STOP your dilantin.  Instead take Keppra as
prescribed for seizure prophalaxis.  You were given
prescriptions for steroids and anti-itch cream that you should
take as directed.

RUQ U/S:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post cholecystectomy. There is
no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common
duct measures 6 mm in diameter, which is not significantly
changed, allowing for differences in technique. The main portal
vein shows appropriate hepatopetal flow. No focal liver lesions
are identified, and the echotexture of the liver appears normal.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction.
.
FRONTAL CHEST: Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable,
with mild cardiomegaly. No focal consolidations are identified
within the lungs. No evidence of pleural effusion. Multiple
right-sided rib fractures again seen. Right-sided central venous
line with tip overlying the distal SVC. Cervical fusion hardware
again noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or
significant change from prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Fever: Blood culture and urine cultures were sent. CXR on
admission did not show focal infiltrate. He was started on vanco
(increased from chronic qod to qd) and zosyn (per discussion w/
ID). His recent hosp admission record [**7-26**] was reviewed and
showed extensive infectious workup which was unrevealing
(including MRI c-spine, which revealed no significant new
changes; neg bone scan; negative blood cultures; negative TEE).
GI and ID were concerned that his line (hickman placed in [**7-25**])
was the source of his fever. He has never had anything cultured
from the line and his cultures are again negative, though his
chronic vancomycin may be suppressing the organism. ID
recommended his home TPN be cultured (including M furfur).
Given negative cultures, the zosyn was discontinued and his
vancomycin was returned to [**Location **] dosing.  The patient remained
afebrile x 24 hours and was thus discharged home with
instructions to continue checking his temperature at least 2
times per day.

Hypotension-Pt was initially hypotensive to SBP 70s in the ED.
He responded quickly to a number of 500cc IVF boluses over the
initial 48 hrs. His BP meds were initially held.  He will
follow-up with his primary care doctor for a repeat blood
pressure check to consider restarting his lisinopril given his
history of MR.  His norvasc and lasix are also being held.

Hyperbilirubinemia/Elevated ALk Phos- His alk phos and bili were
elevated on admission (rest of his LFTs was relatively stable).
He did not complain of pain. RUQ u/s recommended by GI was
unremarkable.  Labs were improving at the time of discharge

Anemia-He has baseline anemia in the range of 35-37. His hct
slowly drifted down to low 30s on admission. Hemolysis labs were
sent but were normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic
disease.  Folate and B12 were normal.

Nutrition-Pt was initially given standard TPN as his home
formula was not available. Dr. [**Name (NI) 79**] (pt 's own GI specialist)
came by on [**8-25**] and gave specific instruction on the
non-standard TPN formulation.

cirrhosis, Hypothyroidism, Anxiety, chronic back pain on
methadone, presenting with systolic BPs in the 60s prior to and
during [**Hospital 58910**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for evaluation and management of
hypotension.
.
She reports 1 month of increasing fatigue, weakness, and
occasional falls (knee buckling). Occasional cough with brown
sputum and chronic loose stools, but no fevers, chills, sweats,
dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stools. Regarding her
complaints, she reports that her BP medications have been
adjusted, but this has not helped. She has also experienced
intermittent L-sided sharp chest pains that worsen with arm
movement, and was prescribed nitroglycerin that she ended up
taking daily instead of on a PRN basis.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.4 P 69 BP 64/53 R 14 97% O2 sat
on RA. Per report, she was mentating appropriately. A triple

Vancomycin and Zosyn, and started on Levophed at 0.06. CXR was
unremarkable. CT C/A/P were obtained and prelim only significant
for a right adenexal cyst (present since [**Month (only) 404**]).
.
On the floor, the patient was appropriate and comfortable. She
was placed on a Nicom. CI and SVI improved with leg raise so Pt

Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo W with Hx of ESRD on HD, HCV cirrhosis, HTN,
Hypothyroidism, and chronic pain on methadone presenting from HD
with hypotension to systolic BPs, initially admitted to ICU,
quickly transferred to medical floor.
.
# Hypotension: Appears to have been developing subacutely, over
the last month. Hypotension is likely secondary to a too
aggressive antihypertensive regimen, current medication misuse,
or possibly over-diuresis at HD (with need for reassessment of
dry weight). Supporting a possible over beta-blockade is a HR
that has consistently remained in the 60s despite BPs in the
60s. Additionally she was started on nitroglycerin and had been
taking it daily rather than on a PRN basis. She is responsible
for her medications, yet unable to correctly remember dosing
regimen. Other etiologies to consider given the chronicity
include endocrine causes such untreated hypothyroidism (pill
bottle not in bag) or adrenal insufficiency.  Received a total
of 1.5 L of volume resuscitation. Levophed weaned off. Outpt
Nephrologist reports dry weight as 74kg. She was started
initially on road spectrum antibiotics which were quickly
discontinued when all cultures were negative.
.
TSH, free T4, and AM Cortisol obtained and pt restarted home
levothyroxine dose for significant hypothyroidism. CT abd/pelvis
was unremarkable except for stable adnexal cyst. Blood pressures
remained stable while patient was off her anti-hypertensives.
After chart review she had been started on these during an
admission for chest pain at which time a cath revealed clean
coronary arteries. Therefore it is felt she does not need these
medications and they were stopped. She will continue on
simvastatin for her cholesterol management and ASA to reduce her
risk of stroke. She will follow up with her PCP or in
[**Name9 (PRE) 1944**] clinic for a BP check off of her medications and
will have VNA checking her BPs at home as well. Her PCP can
titrate medications as necessary
.
# Elevated bicarbonate: Likely [**2-16**] recent HD session, as well as
contraction from intravascular depletion. Supporting this is a
Hct above baseline likely reflecting hemoconcentration. Pt is on
advair without documented hx of COPD. CXR not reflective of this
and bicarb not chronically elevated.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Likely [**2-16**] ESRD. No evidence of peaked T waves
on EKG. She was given insulin, kayexelate overnight and repeated
insulin per renal recs prior to dialysis this AM. K was noted to
be wnl on follow up AM labs.
.
# Prolonged PT/PTT: INR mildly elevated likely [**2-16**] underlying
poor synthetic liver function from cirrhosis. Also may have a
nutritional component as well. Prolonged PTT likely [**2-16**] heparin
received at HD. No evidence to support bleeding.
PTT resolved off heparin.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Chronic issue, likely [**2-16**] cirrhosis.
Platelets were stable and did not require transfusion.
.
# Anemia: [**2-16**] ESRD. BL Hct around 31. On EPO as outpt. Hct was
trended and stable; pt did not require transfusion of blood
components during her ICU stay.
.
# CAD: No evidence to suggest acute ischemia. EKG consistent
with prior. Trop at 0.05, likely [**2-16**] demand in setting of CKI.
CK and CKMB added on and non-concerning for ACS. Pt
asymptomatic. She was continued on asa 81mg, simvastatin 20mg.
BBlocker and ACEi held for observation of hemodynamic stability
given admission complaint.
.
# Hypothyroidism:  TSH grossly elevated with very low T4.
Levothyroxine was not in her pill bag, in discussion with her
pharmacy this prescription had not been filled in many months.
Pt was started on Levothyroxine 188mcg daily, will need repeat
TFT's in [**4-20**] weeks.  [**Month (only) 116**] be contributing to hypotension, fatigue
and depression.  Arranged for her pills to be delivered in a
bubble pack to help with med compliance in the future.
.
# Seizure Disorder: Continued on Keppra 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Depression/Anxiety: SHe has severe depression, uncontrolled.
No SI/HI.  Restarted home clonazepam (held on admission given
hypotention), social work consulted, fluoxitine increased from
40 to 60 mg daily.  She is interested in outpt therapy, to
arranged by her PCP at follow up.
.
# Chronic Pain: On Gabapentin and methadone dose was confirmed
with [**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Op Co to be 44mg daily.
.
# Given prior hx of renal nodule seen on CT scan, pt was ordered
for MRI to be completed during her stay given concern for poor
outpt followup.  MRI renal wo contrast was performed; read was
pending at time of d/c and needs to be followed up by outpatient
providers (either Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] or PCP)
.
# Right adnexal Cyst: Patient was told to follow up with pelvic
ultrasound for right adnexal cyst seen on CT scan. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or
[**Hospital 1944**] clinic will help her coordinate this study.
.
Contact: sister [**Name2 (NI) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 98152**]

# Transitions of care:
- Right adnexal cyst needs transvaginal ultrasound for further
evaluation. To be coordinated with PCP's help
- Blood cultures pending at time of discharge and need to be
followed up at [**Hospital 1944**] clinic
- Patient had MRI of abdomen to evaluate a renal cyst. Final
read pending at discharge and needs to be followed up through
outpatient providers either at [**Hospital 1944**] clinic or with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 805**]
- Patient seemed depressed and her fluoxetine was increased from
40mg to 60mg daily.  Denied SI. At her [**Hospital 1944**] clinic
please assess her mood and help arrange outpt therapy.
- Patient's BP meds were held given hypotension. Post-D/c clinic
will check her BP to ensure stable off meds still.
- Patient had a low blood count (and chronically low plts) which
should be repeated at her post-discharge follow up appt

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure. This
was probably a combination of having dialysis and taking blood
pressure medications. We have stopped your blood pressure
medications as you don't need them. We looked for infections
(which can cause your blood pressure to be low) but could not
find any. Please take your medications exactly as prescribed.
 You also had a CT scan which showed a cyst on your right ovary.
You need an ultrasound of your ovary to evaluate this. You
should coordinate this study with your primary care provider.
 [**Name10 (NameIs) 2172**] CT scan also showed a cyst on your kidney. You had an MRI
to evaluate this. The read on the MRI is pending at this point
and you should follow up with your primary doctor to find out if
there is anything else that needs to be done about this.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation in the field.

History of Present Illness:
73 year old man with history of COPD, hyperlipidemia, HTN who
presents to the ED intubated by paramedics after they were
called to his home for increasing SOB.  The details of the
events leading up to his intubation are not clear.  In
discussion with friend [**Name (NI) 73298**] [**Name (NI) **], she reports that [**Name (NI) 269**] came to
visit on [**12-19**] at which time he was reportedly ""doing well"" in
terms of his respiratory status.  Sometime after [**Month/Year (2) 269**] left,
however, pt. called [**Doctor First Name 73298**] and told her he needed help as he
could not breathe.  It was at that time that EMS was called.
There is no EMS record in paperwork from the ED, but per verbal
report from ED resident, pt was so SOB that he requested
intubation when EMS arrived to his home.  Although per verbal
s/o there was report that he never picked up steroids that were
prescribed on discharge, I am unable to find a record of
steroids having been prescribed during his last admission and
further upon discharge.  He was intubated at home and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
Of note, he was admitted to the surgical service from
[**Date range (1) 21504**]/08 after presenting with abdominal pain/rectal
bleeding and progressive SOB.  He was intubated in emergency
room d/t increasing respiratory distress despite multiple nebs.
NGT tubes was placed with coffee grounds and he reportedly had
episodes of maroon stool  EGD was performed on [**12-2**] which showed
pyloric ulcers, but no e/o active bleeding.  He had subsequent
additional hct drop and EGD was repeated on [**12-13**] showing e/o
recently bleeding pyloric ulcer.  Ulcer was injected with epi
and endoclip was deployed unsuccessfully.  He received a total
of 8 units prbcs, 1 bag platelets, 1 unit FFP last on [**12-3**]
after which his hct remained stable without any further
bleeding.  He was continued on [**Hospital1 **] PPI and was treated for h.
pylori.  Although his respiratory failure was attributed to COPD
exacerbation, it does not appear that he received steroids
during his hospital stay.  He was, however, extubated
successfully and when ambulating with PT during last admission,
he became SOB with O2 sats dipping into the 80% and CTA was
positive for subsegmental PE and he was started on heparin gtt
and transitioned to coumadin prior to discharge.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.0 P 120 BP 95/77 Intubated and
breathing at set rate of 16 O2 sat100% on AC (exact settings
unclear). CTA chest on prelim read showed no PE, pneumonia or
edema; it showed unchanged pulmonary nodules.  UA showed few
bacteria, no squams, 6 WBCs, [**2-27**] RBCs.  He received 125mg IV
solumedrol, 1g IV ceftriaxone and 500mg IV azithromycin x1.  He
received versed for sedation.  He received a total of 6L NS.

Pertinent Results:
Images:
[**2143-12-20**] CTA chest (prelim):  No PE, pneumonia or edema.
Nodules unchanged from 9 days prior.
.
[**2143-12-11**] CTA chest:
1. Isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower
lobe of uncertain clinical significance.
2. 5-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule for which a six-month
followup chest CT is recommended per Fleishner Society
guidelines. Attention should be paid to two 1- mm pulmonary
nodules in the right upper and right middle lobes at that time
as well.
3. Moderate to marked emphysema.
4. Left posterior diaphragmatic defect with adjacent atelectasis

.
[**1-2**] Spirometry:  Moderate to marked obstructive ventilatory
defect.  FEV1 of 0.96. Compared to the prior study of [**2141-8-11**]
there has been no significant change.
.
EKG:  No clear Ps, probable a. flutter at rate of 123.  Normal
axis.  Frequent PVCs.  Biphasic TWs in V5-V6.
.
[**2143-12-12**] TTE:  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2136-3-28**], at least mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is now detected (32-35mmHg). The remaining findings
are similar with normal biventricular systolic function.

[**2143-12-21**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half
of the anterior septum and anterior walls, and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Distal
right ventricular hypokinesis. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2143-12-12**], the regional left ventricular
and right ventricular systolic dysfunciton is new and c/w
interim ischemia (mid LAD distribution).


Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old man with COPD (FEV1 0.96), HTN, hyperlipidemia and
recent GIB from PUD presents 2 days post discharge, intubated at
home by paramedics after c/o increasing dyspnea.

# Respiratory failure likely related to COPD exacurbation:
History surrounding intubation and presentation is largely
unknown as he does not come with EMS paperwork and friend listed
as contact is unaware of the details.  It appears that he had
been doing okay at home since his d/c on [**12-17**], but complained
to his friend over the phone that he needed help d/t increasing
SOB (which prompted EMS call).  Per verbal s/o from ED, he had
been prescribed prednisone upon discharge on [**12-17**] for COPD
exacerbation, but pt did not pick up prescription.  He was
intubated on presentation to the ED on last presentation as well
presumably thought d/t COPD exacerbation.  Was diagnosed with PE
on last admission by CTA on [**12-10**] (""Isolated subsegmental
pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe of uncertain clinical
significance"").  He was on heparin and discharged on coumadin
for this finding and repeat CTA on this presentation does not
even comment on subsegmental PE on prelim read so seems very
unlikely to be causing clinical presentation.  No e/o volume
overload nor of pneumonia on CT chest and unable to obtain hx
re: cough/sputum production. The patient was given IV steroids
which was subsequently trasitioned to oral prednisone with
[**Doctor Last Name 2949**]. He was continued on standing MDIs and was given
azithromycin. Sputum and blood cultures were no growth to date.


# Hypotension:  Normally hypertensive at baseline.  Presented
with SBPs in the 90s where he has largely remained stable
despite 6L IVFs.  Unclear etiology. Infection suspected
initially but his UA was unremarkable and his CT of chest
without e/o infiltrate. No other signs of infection were
evident.  [**Month (only) 116**] be partially med related (fentanyl/versed).  His
SBPs improved during the hospitalization and remained stable
without IVF.

# PE:  On [**12-10**] CTA chest showed small subsegmental PE for which
he was heparinized then transitioned to coumadin for discharge.
INR has been therapeutic and repeat CTA today with prelim report
showing no PE.  Goal INR per d/c summary was 2-2.5 given recent
GIB; INR currently 2.7. Anticoagulation was continued during
this admission.

# Positive cardiac biomarkers:  With elevated CK and MB although
neg MB index; troponin positive at 0.30.  Trop could be up in
setting of PE, but PE on last admission seems so small
(subsegmental) that it is unlikely to be the underlying cause of
his hypoxia and positive trop.  EKG did show probable a.flutter
with rate in the 120s so demand ischemia possible. Continued
statin and ASA; holding BB given relative hypotension.
Cardiology saw the patient and recomended outpatient follow up.

# PUD and recent UGIB:  Serology positive for H. pylori.  It
appears that he was initiated on amoxacillin and clarithromycin
on [**12-4**] and thus, should have completed a full 2 week course at
this time. We continued [**Hospital1 **] PPI and sucralfate

# A. fib/flutter:  EKG from [**12-16**] shows a. fib.  Does not appear
to have diagnsosis of this prior to that.  CHADS2 score of [**12-27**]
with HTN and age nearly >75.  He is currently anticoagulated and
INR is therapeutic.

# Lung nodule:  5-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule on [**12-10**]
CT chest for which a six-month recommended.

Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with an exacurbation of your COPD. You
required intubation for a brief period and were treated with
antibiotics, steroids, neulizers and oxygen. You are being
discharged on steroid medication (prednisone) as well as a
medication to help with your cough (guainefesin). While you are
on steroids, you should take sucralfate. You should continue
Albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, Flovent and Spiriva.

We also noted that your heart exhibited some abnormalities which
we believe are a consequence of your rapid heart rate. We gave
you medications to slow your heard down. We have arranged an
appointment with a heart doctor on an outpatient basis. Also we
have scheduled for you to have a stress test to evaluate your
heart.

We made changes in your blood thining medication (coumadin) and
you are to follow up with a nurse practitioner in the
[**Hospital3 **] in order to have this medication
monitored. Also your visiting nurse can help with this. You
should not take coumadin today because your level was slightly
elevated.

We gave you a new medication to take for your blood pressure
(amlodipine) so now you should take metoprolol, lisinopril and
amlodipine for blood pressure.

Please call your regular doctor or return to the ED if you
experience shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations,
lightheadedness or any other symptom that concerns you. Also be
aware that the blood thining medication places you at risk for
bleeding.

History of Present Illness:
54 year old woman with past medical history significant for
diverticulosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, rhythm controlled
afib not on coumadin and chronic diastolic CHF who now presents
with
bright red blood per rectum for the past 12 hours.
.
Patient states her symptoms began last night about 8:15pm. She
had lower abd cramps and an episode of dark colored stool. She
had nausea with no emesis. Since then has had about 20 bloody
BMs, dark red in color, with some clots. She states she had
undercooked red meat and steamed vegatable for dinner last night
at Friend's home. Her friend had severe diarrhea overnight, but
no rectal bleeding. Pt denies fever/chill, NSAIDs use, but she
is on ASA 81mg daily. She complaints of dizziness last night.
Pt's abdominal pain is much improved now.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.4 P 97 BP 82/27 R 15 O2 sat
100% RA. Patient was given 1 liter NS and her BP improved. On
exam she had lower abdominal tenderness. She has dark red blood
on rectal exam but no more BMs in ER. GI and surgery were
called. NG lavage was negative for blood. Hct was 26 from
baseline of 43, so she was given 2 unit of blood (emergency
unit) and 6 units were cross matched. She was alert during these
encounter. Intravenous Protonix given and Cipro and flagyl were
also given. Access of PIV 18 gauge x 2 was established. At the
time of transfer to the ICU were 73 97/52 15 100%2L.
.
During her MICU course, GI and Surgery followed. She received
total of 6 U PRBC (last one at 8 AM today) 1 U FFP and her last
Bloody BM was 4:30 PM on [**1-30**]. Access was difficult, so despite
having 2 18G, a femoral line was placed and will be kept until
the morning. GI convinced her to have colonoscopy and so started
bowel prep tonight.

ECHO ([**2130-11-10**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-4-22**],
the patient is now in atrial fibrillation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension is identified. The other findings appear largely
similar. LV function is difficult to compare directly between
the studies given the current degree of tachycardia.
.
COLONOSCOPY:
Findings: ([**2131-1-12**])
Contents: Red blood was seen in the rectum and sigmoid colon.
Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid
colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be severe, with no
identifiable single bleeding diverticulum.
Impression: Blood in the rectum and sigmoid colon Diverticulosis
of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to proximal
sigmoid colon
Recommendations: Unable to pass sigmoid due to spasm, dicomfort
and blood contents. No identifiable bleeding lesion in this
limited exam. If bleeding persists, please obtain bleeding scan,
contact IR. Consider surgical consult.
.
[**2132-2-1**]: Mutiple diverticuli throughout the colon. Able to get
to ileocecal valve this time with general sedation.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old woman with past medical history of diverticulosis
with past GI bleeds, atrial fibrillation (CHADS1, not on
coumadin) who presented with acute bright red blood per rectum,
hypotension and 20 point hematocrit drop. Patient was initially
in the MICU and then transferred to the floor where she
tolerated bowel preparation and underwent colonoscopy showing
diffuse diverticular disease but no more active bleeding.
.
# Bright red blood per rectum: Gastroenterology and General
Surgery followed the patient closely in-house. Hematocrit
stabilized after 6 units pRBC, 1 unit FFP. Etiology likely
diverticular bleed given her long-standing history of
constipation and history of significant diverticular bleeds.
Also on the differential but lower include ischemic colitis
given atrial fibrillation (without coumadin) and lactate 4.2
initially. Repeat colonoscopy revealed extensive diverticular
disease throughotu patient's colon. Her IV pantoprazole was
discontinued and patient started on clears diet which she
tolerated well; her diet was eventually advanced. Patient was
educated on dietary/bowel management for diverticuli and
discharged with close follow-up in GI and Gen [**Doctor First Name **] clinics.
Patient is to discuss surgical option, such as bowel resection,
given her significant history of dangerous diverticular bleeds
in the past (X3-4?)
.
# PRURITIC RASH: Slightly erythematous and excoriated. Responded
to Sarna lotion. Patient felt the IV pantoprazole caused her
rash.
.
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient remained in sinus
rhythm. Given her GI bleed, aspirin was held, to be restarted
upon discharge. She was continued on Propafenon short acting, to
resume her home long acting version upon discharge.
.
# CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Well compensated, although
likely tolerates rapid ventricular response very poorly. No
crackles and trace lower extremity edema on exam. After her
colonoscopy, patient's home Diltiazem dose was restarted in
short-acting form. Her enalapril was held to be restarted when
patient was discharged home.
.
# OSTEOARTHRITIS: Stable and pain well controlled with tylenol
and oxycodone PRN
.
# BLADDER TUMOR: No clinical evidence of recurrence and was
stable.
.
# Right Femoral line: Difficult access and initial IJ was
attempted unsuccessfully. Patient had two peripheral IVs as well
and after colonoscopy, had the right femoral line removed
without issues. Site remained clean, dry and intact until after
discharge.
.

History of Present Illness:
64 yo woman w/ h/o recurrent PEs s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter, GIB
while anticoagulated, COPD, who was discharged [**2107-1-12**] after
being treated for new PE presented to the ED with SOB and
productive cough. She was readmitted [**2107-1-17**] after she was
found to have a multifocal pneumonia and was treated with
Levo/Flagyl and Vanco. Cultures were positive for MRSA. Levo and
Flagyl were continued for suspected aspiration PNA. The pt
recovered quickly over since admission and she is now back on
her home O2 requirement. She was getting bridged for her
anticoagulation with Lovenox starting [**1-18**] in preparation for
discharge.  However, she developed severe abdominal pain and a
palpable mass in her L abdomen. A CT was showed a new large
hematoma in the muscles of the left anterior and lateral lower
abdominal and pelvic wall, without any intraperitoneal or
retroperitoneal extent, but with associated mass effect on the
lower abdominal and pelvic bowel loops. Surgery was [**Month/Year (2) 4221**]
and suggested no intervention, but monitoring for now. HCT
dropped 6 points in this setting, but she remained
hemodynamically stable with tachycardia which has been present
throughout her hospital stay (95-115).

She required a total of 5 units PRBC and 4 units FFP
transfusions and was transferred to the MICU for further
monitoring.  Her hematocrit has since been stable with serial
checks.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
64F w/ h/o recurrent PE s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter, GIB on
anticoagulation, COPD, recently admitted for new PE, readmitted
for multifocal PNA, who developed a large abdominal wall
hematoma in the context of enoxaparin injections.

# Multifocal Pneumonia: She was admitted with multifocal
pneumonia. She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin.  She
completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin.  MRSA was found to
grow in her sputum so she was continued on a 14 day course of
vancomycin. She originally presented with elevated WBC count and
left shift which quickly resolved with the initiation of
antibiotics.  Her productive cough improved as well and she
remained on her baseline home O2 of 2L.  Approximately 4 days
after completion of her 14 day course of Vancomycin, the patient
developed worsening cough, SOB, and upper respiratory symptoms.
A repeat CXR showed evidence of a new consolidation in the RLL.
The patient was started back on Levofloxacin/Flagyl.  Vancomycin
was added to her regimen when blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles
with GPC in clusters and chains.  Additionally, her sputum
culture grew out GNRs.  Levofloxacin was discontinued and
Meropenem was started for concern for Pseudomonas given the
patient's long hospital course.  Her O2 sat remained stable
93-100% on 2L nasal cannula (which is her baseline).  She was
given mucomyst inhaled nebulizers to assist in breaking up thick
sputum.  Her GNRs in the sputum grew out E. coli.  Because of
the sensitivity profile of the E. coli and the patient's allergy
to penicillin and cephalosporins, the patient was continued on
Meropenem.  Her GPCs were found to grow out Coag negative Staph.
 Surveillance cultures had no further growth and the coag
negative staph was thought to likely be a contaminant.  Her
Vancomycin was discontinued.  She will continue a 14 day course
of Meropenem and she was discharged with a PICC to complete this
course.
.
# Pulmonary embolism/DVTs: She has had multiple PEs and has had
one even since the placement of a TrapEase IVC filter. CT during
recent previous hospitalization revealed appropriate location of
filter and CTA on this admission showed improvement of clot.
Admission labwork revealed an INR of 7.9.  Coumadin was thus
held and reversed with FFP and vitamin K given her history of
GIB on anticoagulation.  In the interim, therapeutic lovenox
injections were initiated, but within days of starting, she
developed a large abdominal wall hematoma near to lovenox
injection site.  Once her hematocrit stabilized, she was started
on a heparin gtt with coumadin overlap.  While [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9533**] her
Coumadin with an INR 1.2, she was found to have a large Hct drop
and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new rectus hematoma.  She
was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
It was decided after her second hematoma while on
anticoagulation, the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the
benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated.  In terms
of her hypercoagulable workup, it has been negative thus far for
hyperhomocysteinemia, Factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid
antibody. Malignancy workup included a colonoscopy and EGD as
well as CEA, all of which were within normal limits. SPEP
revealed hypogammaglobulinemia, but was otherwise unremarkable.
During her hospital course, she also began to complain of
worsening lower extremity pain.  LENIs were obtained which
showed evidence of extensive, completely occlusive, bilateral
deep venous thrombi extending from the common femoral veins to
the popliteal veins.  Radiology felt that these clots were most
likely acute to subacute in nature.  In this setting,
hematology/oncology saw the patient again to consider the risks
vs benefits of anticoagulation.  Antithrombin III, prothrombin
mutation, Lupus anticoagulation and [**Location (un) 1169**] Venom Viper were
sent to reevaluate the reason for her hypercoagulability.  The
hematology/oncology team still felt that the risks of
coagulation outweigh the potential benefits given that the
patient has had multiple bleeding episodes in the setting of
anticoagulation.

# Abdominal wall hematoma: As mentioned above, she developed a
large left-sided abdominal wall hematoma from a Lovenox
injection site that caused a significant hct drop (originally
28.1-->19.4).  Despite the drop, she remained hemodynamically
stable (has sinus tachycardia at baseline prior to bleed). She
received 3 units prbcs, 4 units FFP. Her hematocrit then
stabilized and once stable, she was restarted on heparin gtt.
Coumadin was re-initiated and heparin gtt was continued while
awaiting her INR to become therapeutic.  While [**Location (un) 9533**] her
Coumadin with an INR 1.2, she was found to have another Hct drop
(25.9-> 22.2) and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new
right-sided rectus hematoma.  She was subsequently transferred
to the MICU for closer monitoring.  She was given 1 unit FFP and
9 units PRBCs between [**Date range (1) 39125**] until her hematocrit became
stable and she bumped appropriately to transfusion.  It was
decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation, the
risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and
she was not anticoagulated.  She has complained of [**6-16**]
abdominal pain with movement and has maintained stable
hematocrits.  Her pain is most likely [**3-11**] to the large rectus
hematoma that will resolve over time.  Her Hct remained stable
after her anticoagulation was discontinued.

# Thoracic mass:  CT chest and abdomen revealed a stable
thoracic mass (stable x 3years) and thought potentially
consistent with neural cyst.  It was not further evaluated by
MRI given its long term stability and also she has metal
hardware in place s/p elbow surgery and facial plates.  It
should be followed up with imaging to ensure it remains
unchanged in the future.

# ? Zoster:  Patient reports having a history of ""herpes"" on her
right buttock.  During her stay, she developed a tingling,
itchiness and multiple small erythematous skin lesions on her
right buttock over the S2, S3 dermatomal distribution.  There
were no vesicles appreciated.  She was treated with acyclovir.

# Candidal vaginitis:  Treated with fluconazole x 2 with
resolution of symptoms.

# H/o GI bleeding during recent admission: Recent colonoscopy
showed diverticulosis with no active signs of bleeding.  She had
no blood in her stools during this admission even while
anticoagulated.  Her stools were guiac-ed multiple times and
were found to be guiac negative.

# Constipation: She is constipated at baseline and requires
daily scheduled bowel regimen to maintian regularity.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on lipitor.

# Depression/SAD: Continued on Prozac, risperdone, wellbutrin,
and klonopin.

# Ulcerative Colitis: Remains in remission.  She was continued
on mesalamine.

# Orthostatic hypotension: She remained asymptomatic even while
ambulating with physical therapy.  She was continued on
midodrine.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2142-5-2**] where
the patient underwent redo, AVR (tissue), revision of PDA/OM
graft .   Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  He
developed urinary retention.  Foley was re-inserted and Flomax
started, he voided following 2nd foley removal.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to home with Partners [**Name (NI) 269**] in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy
Central line placement by VIR

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 70011**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with severe RA who presented to OSH
with LGIB on [**11-11**]. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-gastric lavage was negative. Initally
the patient was hypotensive with SBP in the 80s. The patient was
given fluids and was transfused 2U of FFP and 2U of PRBC. Only
poor peripheral access was obtained (20G in foot) and therefore
a CVL was attempted. An attempt for a R femoral line was
unsuccessful. A RIJ attempt was unsuccessful as the wire was
traveling in the head. When trying to place a L subclavian line,
the physician in the OSH was unable to withdraw the wire. A CXR
revealed the CVL wire coiled in the IVC filter. The patient is
transfered for IR intervention to withdraw the wire.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient denied any CP, SOB,
abdominal pain, back pain. She denied any BRBPR prior to this
episode. She states that the BRBPR started last two days. The
patient denies ever having had any colonoscopy before. She
denies any LH or dizziness. The patient is s/p recent THR that
was complicated by a DVT. The pt had an IVC filter placed and
was on Heparin sc TID for DVT prophylaxis.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
Rheumatoid Arthritis - c/b chronic right pleural effusion, s/p
recent thoracentesis, felt to be due to RA
HTN
Atrial fibrillation
h/o of CVA with residual L sided weakness
Frequent UTIs
.
PSH:
S/p b/l TKR in [**2193**]
s/p R total hip replacement in [**9-/2198**] complicated by a DVT for
which an IVC filter was placed

Addendum/clarification based on discussion with the PCP ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 4468**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70012**]):

She underwent R THR at [**Hospital3 934**] in [**5-15**] without
complications, discharged on coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.
Readmitted in [**6-14**] with thigh pain and a DVT was seen.  On
lovenox, plavix and aspirin, she developed a thigh hematoma
complicated by hypotension, so anticoagulation was stopped and
they placed an IVC filter.  She was D/C'd to [**Location (un) 931**] House.
She was readmitted [**8-15**] for chest pain and hypotension and found
to have RA pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and pleuritis.
Placed on steroids.  Readmitted [**10-15**] for the same and also
developed A fib which spontaneously recovered.  Readmitted [**11-11**]
from rehab because she was placed on heparin SQ despite the IVCF
and developed BRBPR and hypotension.


Social History:
She has been living in a Rehab since her THR in [**9-14**]. Prior to
this, she lived alone with help from her son. She denies ETOH
and tobacco use.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Gen: NAD, AAOx3
HEENT: PERRLA, mmm, no dentures in place
NECK: no LAD, no JVD visible
COR: S1S2, regular rhythm, non-radiating systolic murmur [**12-15**]
over precordium, distant heart sounds.
PULM: CTA b/l, no wheezing or rhonchi
ABD: + bowel sounds, soft, nd, nt
Skin: cool extremities, no rash, limited range of motion in UE
joints, ecchymosis in R groin, wire taped to her left shoulder
EXT: 1+ DP, no edema/c/c, dermatosclerotic changes in feet b/l


Pertinent Results:
[**11-11**]: EKG: rate 72, Nsr, no ST changes or TWIs, normal intervals

.
[**11-11**] CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions.  Subsegmental atelectasis
right
base.  Increased density in the retrocardiac area, which may
represent
atelectasis or consolidation.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1.  CT colonography unable to be performed due to lack of rectal
tone.
2.  Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis.  Assessment of the
nondistended colon is limited, but there is an area of
asymmetric wall thickening with mucosal enhancement in a loop of
redundant sigmoid colon low in the left lower quadrant.  While
this could be related to recent colonoscopy or represent
inflammatory changes from diverticulosis, given the history of
GI bleeding, a neoplastic process cannot be excluded. Targeted
colonoscopy of this area or single-contrast barium enema could
be performed for further assessment. Given lack rectal tone,
single contrast enema may not be successful.
3.  Findings consistent with proctitis.
4.  Air in the bladder.  Correlate with recent history of Foley
catheter
placement. Given extensive diverticular disease, in the absence
of prior Foley catheterization, this would raise suspicion for
enterovesicular fistula.  No areas of asymmetric bladder wall
thickening are identified adjacent to sigmoid colon to indicate
an enterovesicular fistula.
5.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] F with PMH of RA, THR c/b DVT, s/p IVC filter placement,
admitted to MICU with LGIB.
.
1) LGIB: Patient presented to outside hospital with lower GI
bleed and hypotension.  She received 2 units of FFP and 2 units
of PRBC's at outside hospital and was subsequently transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  She was admitted to the MICU
at [**Hospital1 18**] and GoLytely was administered in preparation for a
colonoscopy.  On admission to this institution, she had a large
drop in her hct from 33.8 to 26.6 and was transfused an
additional 2 units of PRBC's and started on IV PPI.  She was
subsequently hemodynamically stable for the duration of her
hospital course.  EGD/colonoscopy revealed ischemic-appearing
mucosa in the sigmoid colon and severe sigmoid narrowing, which
they were unable to pass with the colonoscope.  She underwent a
diagnostic colonography under fluroscopy for further evaluation
of  stricture vs. obstructing mass.  This study revealed severe
sigmoid diverticulosis and findings consistent with proctitis.
If indeed these findings are consistent ischemic colitis, it may
be related to hypotensive event (reported per PCP) which
occurred at outside hospital.  At time of discharge, she was
hemodynamically stable, and no further intervention was advised.
 This was discussed with both patient's son and her PCP who
stated their agreement with plan for conservative management.
.
2) Access:  At the outside hospital, Ms. [**Known lastname 70011**] had several
unsuccessful attempts at line placement and was transferred with
a guidewire which was felt to be hooked into her IVC filter.  IR
found that in fact this was not the case, and they were able to
remove the wire without difficulty. A left SVC triple lumen
catheter was placed by IR for access in the setting of active GI
bleeding, as patient had a tenuous situation with peripheral
IV's.
.
3) Rheumatoid Arthritis - Patient has a long history of RA for
30 years and is on a slow prednisone taper for recent RA
pericarditis & pleuritis.  Current dose of 20 mg was continued
to prevent adrenal insufficiency.  Her PCP will continue to
manage the slow taper after discharge.
.
4) Leukocytosis:  Most likely due to chronic prednisone.  No
clinical, radiographic, or other laboratory evidence of
infection.
.
5) Afib:  Sotalol was briefly held secondary to concern over
brisk bleeding.  Once GI bleeding had subsided, it was
restarted.  Heart rate was well-controlled.  She is not
currently a candidate for anticoagulation given GI bleed.
.
6) FEN: Received gentle IVFs initially following admission.
Following colonoscopy, diet was slowly advanced from clear
liquids to regular cardiac diet, which patient tolerated well.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed to maintain K>4, Mg>2.
.
7) Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.  Patient has
IVC filter in place given h/o DVT.  PPI for GI prophylaxis.
.
8) Access: L SCV line placed by IR; removed prior to discharge.

.
9) Code status: DNR/DNI

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted from [**Hospital **] Hospital with a catheter coiled
in the filter in your inferior vena cava.  You were evaluated by
Interventional Radiology, and the catheter was disentangled.
.
You have also been evaluated for the source of your GI bleeding.
 Initially you received a blood transfusion to stabilize your
hematocrit.  Your colonoscopy showed evidence of diverticulosis
and of ischemia in your sigmoid colon (which means that your
bowel may not be getting adequate blood supply to it).  Ischemic
colitis is likely the source of your lower GI bleed. There is no
further intervention necessary for these conditions.  Your
bleeding has subsided, and you have been hemodynamically stable
for several days.
.
You should return to the hospital if you experience gross blood
in your stool, shortness of breath, or chest pain.


Followup Instructions:
You will follow-up with your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 70012**].

ascending and arch levels are normal. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-30**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. EF 20-25%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-4**], no
clear change (given LV dysfunciton persists, Takotsubo CM is no
longer on the differential). If indicated, a repeat study with
echo contrast OR a cardiac MRI may better assess LV/RV function
and exclude apical thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
66F with CAD s/p CABG [**2085**], HL, PAD s/p B/L AKA in [**2112**] & AAA
endovascular repair [**2104**], hypothyroid, 1 PPD [**Last Name (LF) 1818**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30-35%
per [**Hospital1 34**] echo [**2114**], obesity, decub ulcer, ventral hernia with
ulceration p/w VT storm to [**Hospital1 34**] now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible VT ablation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13177**].
.
#Arrhythmia: SVT with RBBB with intervals of VTach (runs of
between 3 and 18 each time). At least two ectobic sites, one in
the atria causing the SVT and one causing the VT. Probable
causes previous MI, hyper/hypotension, elytes. Pt denies any
CP/SOB/orthopnea. TSH was normal at 1.8. ECG from [**Hospital1 34**] showed
NSVT negative in II, III, F, positive in 1, L, transition at
V3/V4 in setting of SVT possible AT at 260.
ECG on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] in sinus showed RBBB, LAFB, left atrial
abnormality
Pt was started on procainamide gtt at 3, VT initially reduced
but then flared up and gtt was increased to 4, and then DCd
prior to ablation. CCU attending ?????? 60 minutes critical care. Pt
continued to have runs of VT and was taken for ablation. EP lab
transseptal approach to ablate focus in LV, however found
several other foci of VT as well as AT. Given multiple foci not
all of which successfully ablated, decision to treat with
antiarrythmics.  Pt also had a competing atrial tachycardia.
Given procainamide 950mg IV bolus which converted to sinus
(although sinus rhythm difficult to tell from VT - mainly by
rate - VT rate was 130, sinus in 90s) and then transitioned to
amiodarone with procainamide DCd. Pt was monitored but continued
having occasional runs of VT, and plan was to place permanent
pacer. Progressive second degree heart block throughout day
after the procedure with HR transiently dropping to 30s although
BP stable. Resited RIJ to left cordis/ trauma line and placed
temp transvenous pacer. However, she developed septic picture
and permanent hardware was not able to be placed in that setting
(see sepsis, below). Patient had sedation weaned and did not
regain consciousness. In the setting of increasing leukocytosis,
worsening renal failure, anasarca, and acute wound dehiscence at
her groin puncture sites extending deep into the groin tissue,
patient was transitioned to comfort measures only per the wishes
of her family on the morning of [**2116-12-28**]. At 1827 on [**12-28**],
patient expired peacefully of cardiac arrest, with family at
bedside.
.
# Hypotension: Patient's SBP during course of illness ranged
from low of 50s to 90. In the unit the MAPS have been btw 55-70
with SBP of 77-94 and DBP of 48-60. Probable causes are
cardiogenic(previous MI with non-contractile myocardium, SVT/VT,
valvular dxs), hypovolemia, anemia, sepsis, hypothyroidism,
non-compliance to medication). Pt was started on levophed but in
setting of VT/arrythmia with increased ectopy this was changed
to neosynephrine.
.
# CHF: Ptn with previous hx of CAD/MI and CABG.On Ace inh and BB
at home. Probable causes for decompensation include arrythmias,
hypovolemia, anemia. Repeat echo shows decline in EF: [**Month (only) **]/12 -
10-15%, from 30-35% in [**2114**]. Diuresis was attempted with lasix
but was minimally successful. Diuretics then held in setting of
hypotension. ACEI and Bblocker also held in setting of
hypotension.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine 0.8 on [**2116-12-21**], went up to 1.8 on [**2116-12-27**].
Renal assisted in examination of urine sediment and no casts
were seen. Cytology consistent with pre-renal picture (shrunken
RBCs) but no signs of ATN. FeNa was 0.13%.
.
# Sepsis - WBC to 23 on [**2116-12-27**]. Pt still with phenylephrine
pressor requirement, fevers, and intermittently tachycardic. UA
was dirty and there was evidence of skin breakdown around the
areas where pt had vascular access. PT also had history of MRSA
colonization, and was started empirically on vanc/cefepime. -
central line in RIJ was changed over a wire. New line was placed
in LIJ and catheter tip of RIJ was sent for culture. Urine
culture showed no growth. Blood cultures pending at time of
expiration.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia. Probably 2/2 blood
loss (dark stool reported), hemolysis or anemia of chronic
illness. Hct down at 31 from 38  five days earlier.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR - pt had INR of 2.5 on presentation (on
warfarin for h/o DVT) which peaked at 4.5 on [**2116-12-26**] even though
coumadin was held after INR was supratherapeutic at 3.5.
.
# Sacral, chest, abdominal, groin wounds: Chronic wounds. Groin
wounds developed secondary to femoral catheterization. Pain
controlled with methadone.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 101426**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2119-7-14**] for a cardiac
catheterization. This revealed significant left main and three
vessel coronary artery disease. As he developed chest pain
during his catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed. The cardiac surgical service was urgently consulted and
surgical revascularization was recommended. Mr. [**Known lastname 101426**] was
taken urgently to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see operative
note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. The next morning, his intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned off and removed without incident. He
then awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On
postoperative day two, he developed a right pneumothorax
following removal of his chest tubes. A right pleural tube was
thus placed with resolution of his pneumothorax. Later on
postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. After a water seal trial, the right pleural
chest tube was removed and he subsequently developed a large
right pneumothorax that required a chest tube to be reinserted.
Follow up chest X-Ray revealed right lung rexpanded. This chest
tube wsa pulled [**7-19**] without incident after clamping and serial
CXR. The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance
with his postoperative strength and mobility. Beta blockade,
aspirin and a statin were resumed. Mr. [**Known lastname 101426**] continued to
make steady progress and was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge
to home. He was in normal sinus rhythm and his chest xray showed
a small pleural effusion with stable bilateral apical
pneumothoraces. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
All follow up appointments were advised.

transferred from [**Hospital3 **] ED from NH for hypoxia.
.
Today at his nursing home, he was found around 1:30pm to be more
lethargic, short of breath with BP 70/50 and difficult to assess
radial pulses.  O2sat 86% on RA. Pt was BIBA to [**Hospital3 **]
ED, VS at EMS evaluation was P 50, BP 70/P, RR 20, unable to get
a pulse ox, FSBS 114.  In the [**Name (NI) 46**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was alert but noted
to be cyanotic and pallid with mottled skin.  Pt c/o diffuse
abdominal pain. VS were not recorded.  Labs notable for WBC 21.1
(88.3N, no bands), CPK 48 but trop I 0.6 (ref 0-0.04) - ?0.47
when confirmed; pt remained CP free and EKG showed a paced
rhythm at 80 bpm.  CXR was read as unremarkable with pacing
leads in place. Noncontrast CT chest showed ""small patchy
interstitial infiltrates with focal bronchiectasis and
nodularity in the posterior left lung base"" and emphysematous
changes.  Noncontrast CT abdomen was unremarkable other than for
mild diverticulosis. Pt was given vanco/zosyn and 3L IV fluid
without improvement in his Started on peripheral levophed for
SBP 70/palpable and given hydrocortisone 100mg IV.  He was
transferred to our ED for further management.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T97.8 P80 SBP135 R18 100% on NRB.
Transferred on 13 mcg of peripheral levophed but pt was given
another 1L NS, and pressures remained stable after levophed
weaned off. CXR with increased infiltrate in LLL. WBC 17, Hct
25, guaiac negative. Lactate 2.1. EKG paced at 80. Pt given

On arrival to the ICU, pt without any complaints other than L
toe pain.  Earlier abdominal pain had resolved at some point in
the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; not c/w GERD.  He does recall feeling more
dyspneic on exertion for several days.  No CP, shoulder/jaw
pain, palpitations, N/V, LH.  Per son, pt was recently admitted
to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**5-3**] for dyspnea and L toe pain.  Per his
son, there was concern for DVT and PE, but LENIs and d-dimer
were negative.  He was treated with nitro, lasix, ASA, plavix,

HISTORY: This is an 85-year-old male with elevated white blood
cell count,
hypotension and wheeze. Evaluate for acute process.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2114-7-3**].

SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is no change in
the
cardiomediastinal contour, with mild cardiomegaly, but no
evidence for CHF. A
left chest pacing device is in unchanged position in comparison
to [**2114**].
There is left lung base atelectasis, but developing infection
cannot be
completely excluded. The bony thorax appears unremarkable.


IMPRESSION: Left lung base atelectasis, but developing pneumonia
cannot be
excluded. PA and lateral may be helpful for further evaluation
if clinically
feasible.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Shock:
Patient with hypotension requiring pressors at OSH ED with a
lactate 2.1.  At [**Hospital1 18**] patient was responsive to IVF and weaned
off levophed.   Most likely septic given mild hypothermia, WBC
17.3 and neutrophilia, hypoxia, and CT chest finding c/w
pneumonia.  While it is possible that the leukocytosis may be
secondary to prednisone, the prednisone may also be masking a
fever.  Treated empirically with vanc, zosyn with rapid
improvment. There may have also been a component of hypovolemia
in setting of decreased oral intake at [**Hospital1 1501**] given response to
IVF.  Pt has only been on short taper of prednisone so less
likely adrenal insufficiency although did receive hydrocortisone
at OSH.  Pt with elevated troponin but less likely cardiogenic
shock - may more likely represent end organ damage from
hypoperfusion; no evidence of CHF and BP unlikely to reverse so
quickly.  He was never again hypotensive on the floor and his
white count resolved with IV Abx.  We were never 100% convinced
that this was from pneumonia and a foot CT was checked prior to
discharge to r/o osteomyelitis which showed no evidence of
osteomyelitis. All cultures were negative.
.
Plan going forward:
-Complete 14day course of broad spectrum abx (last day [**5-28**])
-Patient must have CXR in 1 month to f/u for complete resolution
of his PNA/r/o underlying malignancy.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient quickly weaned from NRB to NC to room air.
This was likely related to pneumonia, though volume overload
from resuscitation can not be excluded, or any contribution from
his underlying lung disease.
.
# CAD: Nl CK but elevated trop likely represents demand in
setting of ARF and hypoperfusion rather than an occlusive
lesion. The patient peaked and ruled out on labs in house. EKG
was paced and c/w prior.  Per son, recent stress test
unremarkable.
.
# DM: Patient had issues with o/n low blood sugars, [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted, we dialed back his PM humalog and lantus and his
blood sugar control optimized.
.
# Anemia: Hct here 25.5, was 32.3 at OSH.  Pt is on ASA and
plavix but guaiac negative, no evidence of active bleeding.
Concern for DIC in setting of sepsis although pt currently
appears well. [**Month (only) 116**] have been hemoconcentrated at OSH and now
diluted in setting of 4L IVF. Patient drifted back up to 33
without intervention
.
# Toe pain: Recently s/p LLE stenting; embolic event possible,
but this was thought to be most likely Gout in house. Prior
noted mottling more likely d/t shock than embolus however as b/l
and appears to be improving w/ fluid resuscitation.  No acute
inflammation concerning for gout although has been on
prednisone. Pain unchanged per pt. He underwent CT foot to r/o
osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis as a source, this instead showed
evidence of pseudogout and osteoarthritis.
.
Plan going forward:
Patient has follow-up scheduled with rheumatology
.
#DVT/?PE:  Patient found to have RUE DVT on exam, later found to
have LLL consolidation with resolution of RUE swelling.  Most
likley PE.  Patient to continue lovenox.
.
Plan going forward:
Patient to continue [**Hospital1 **] lovenox for [**4-13**] mo, pending PCP f/u
.
Urinary Retention:
Patient developed new urinary retention while in house.  This
was felt to be secondary to oxycodone which was stopped.  A
foley was placed on the day prior to d/c and the patient was
started on flomax.
.
Plan going forward:
Foley to be d/c'd in 3 days, patient must void spontaneously
8-10 hours following the removal.  If he does not void the floor
physician must be consulted.

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 5911**]
Chief Complaint:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] presented for scheduled laparoscopic bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomies due to bilateral ovarian cysts with
solid components.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies,
pelvic peritoneal washings with emergent conversion to
laparotomy for repair of trocar injury to left common iliac
artery and vein.
2. Primary repair of left common iliac artery.
3. Primary repair of left common iliac vein.
4. Blood transfusion.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] is a 53-year-old G4, P4-0-0-4 perimenopausal
Caucasian female with bigeminy arrhythmia, depression, GERD, and
is S/P C/S x4 plus LTL. Ms. [**First Name (Titles) 111231**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a pelvic
ultrasound [**12/2179**] for complaints of abnormal bleeding.  It
revealed a 7.7 cm right posterior cul-de-sac cyst separate from
the right ovary and a 3.5 cm simple left ovarian cyst.  The
uterus measured 10.9 cm but was otherwise unremarkable with
endometrial stripe of 8 mm.  She had a followup pelvic
ultrasound ([**2180-2-2**]) that revealed resolution of the 7.7 cm
posterior cul-de-sac cyst with a normal right adnexa.  She had
two left ovarian cysts sizing 2-2.5 cm.  Endometrial stripe
measured 1.1 cm with a questionable 6-mm endometrial polyp.
.
In regards to her endometrial lesion and abnormal bleeding, she
[**Year (4 digits) 1834**] an office endometrial biopsy ([**2180-1-18**]).  It
revealed scant inactive endometrium with no evidence of
endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.  A diagnostic office
hysteroscopy ([**2180-4-19**]) revealed a normal endometrial cavity
with no evidence of any endometrial polyps or submucosal
fibroids.  There were no active issues regarding the endometrial
findings and the patient maintained expectant management.  In
regards to her abnormal bleeding, given the benign endometrial
biopsy and normal hematocrit, the patient opted to maintain
expectant management.
.
In regards to her pelvic and left ovarian cysts, it appeared
that the patient had remained asymptomatic and this was an
incidental finding.  The large 7.7 cm right posterior cul-de-sac
cyst had resolved spontaneously and the left adnexal cyst
appeared to be oscillating in size and simple in nature.
Therefore, the patient opted to maintain expectant management
with intermittent surveillance given her asymptomatic state.
.
She recently had a pelvic ultrasound at [**Location (un) 620**] under Dr.[**Name (NI) 14510**]
(PCP) instructions.  PUS ([**2182-11-12**]) at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] reveals a
uterus measuring 11 x 4.2 x 6 cm.  Endometrial stripe measured 7
mm.  No endometrial polyp was appreciated.  The right ovary
measured 3 cm in its greatest dimension with a large 8.9 x 4 cm
cyst containing some debris.  There was additionally a smaller
1.3 cm nodule within it.  A third cystic area with flow was also
noted along the edge of this large cystic lesion.  On the left,
the left ovary measured 5 cm in its greatest dimension and
contained a 2.2 cm simple cyst.  There was an additional 1.1-cm
solid nodule & a small amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac.
.
She denied any symptoms related to these PUS findings such as
pelvic pain.  On review of her menstrual pattern, she does
report a pattern of oligomenorrhea consistent with
perimenopause.  She did skip her menses in [**4-/2182**], [**5-/2182**], and
[**6-/2182**] and has then resumed monthly menses in [**Month (only) 205**] with each
episode lasting roughly five to eight days.  The amount of
bleeding is lighter than her prior moderate to heavy flow noted
two years ago. The patient continues to remain asymptomatic.
Given the size of the lesions and the solid components, I
advised surgical management even though she remains
asymptomatic. After careful consideration, the patient would
like to proceed with surgical evaluation.  A plan for a
laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies with possible
conversion to laparotomy was discussed.  Pelvic peritoneal
washings will be obtained.  We also discussed the need for a
staging procedure should surgical findings reveal a malignant
condition.  The patient was consented for a laparoscopic
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies, pelvic peritoneal washings,
possible laparotomy, and possible staging procedure.  She
understands that a staging procedure will be performed by one of
our gynecologic-oncologist here at [**Hospital1 18**] if indicated (greatly
appreciated).  The nature of the surgery, potential surgical
risks, likely hospital and postoperative course were discussed
with the patient in detail today.  Informed consent was
obtained.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 111230**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] laparoscopic bilateral
salpingoophorectomies and pelvic washings that was complicated
by a trocar injury to the left common iliac artery and vein
injury.  She had an emergent conversion to a laparotomy with a
primary vessel repair (with assistance from Gynecologic
Oncology, General Surgery, and [**Last Name (Titles) **] Surgery-- please see
operative reports for details). Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] was transferred
after the procedure to the ICU intubated, in stable conditon.
Patient was extubated in AM POD#1 and called out of the ICU.
Her course is described below by system:
.
RESPIRATOY: Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] was extubated on post-operative day #1
and had no respiratory complications during her admission.
.
HEME: Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1801**] was noted to have a consumptive
coagulopathy. She recieved a total of 10u PRBC, 7u FFP, 1000cc
Cellsaver, 1u plts in terms of blood products. Her
post-operative HCT was stable.  The INR and fibrinogen were
followed and noted to normalize by discharge. She remained
hemodynamically stable and never required pressors in her
post-operative course.
.
[**Last Name (Titles) **]: [**Last Name (Titles) **] surgery followed her as a consultative
service and advised q4 hour pulse checks, bedside ABIs, DVT
prophylaxis (SC hep ppx transitioned to 81mg aspirin daily),
compression stockings as outpatient, activity restrictions as an
outpatient and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
ID: Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] was treated with a broad spectrum antibiotic
regimen including vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl from [**1-9**] until
[**1-12**]. She remained afebrile on and off antibiotics.
.
FEN/GI: Patient complained of nausea.  She was treated with
Zofran, Protonix, Reglan, Tums, and Bicitra for nausea likely
secondary to medications and GERD. She had bowel movements,
flatus and no abdominal distension, making the diagnosis of
ileus unlikely. Her diet was advanced as tolerated. Nutrition
was consulted to ensure appropriate calorie intake. Ms.
[**Known lastname 111232**] weight was noted to be elevated and her exam revealed
edema from fluid retention. She responded well to diuresis with
IV lasix.
.
NEURO: Ms. [**Known lastname 111232**] pain was well-controlled with a morphine
PCA which was transtioned to po vicodin on [**2183-1-13**] POD#4.  She
demonstrated full neurologic function and was alert and oriented
throughout her recovery.
.
OTHER: Social work consult was offered to aid in family coping
and deconditioning, but patient declined. Patient with strong
family support.  Physical therapy was consulted.
.
She recovered smoothly and was transferred from the ICU to the
VICU on POD#1, then to a regular floor on post-operative day #5
and discharged home on postoperative day #6 in good condition:
ambulating and urinating without difficulty, tolerating a
regular diet, and with adequate pain control using PO
medication. She had follow-up with the [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] and gynecology
services.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 37 year old female who presented to OSH with 5 days of
LLQ/left flank pain. She was initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] on [**9-14**] and was diagnosed with a ruptured ovarian cyst
on TVUS; she was discharged on oxycodone-APAP. On [**9-15**] she
developed subjective fevers/rigors, increased pain, and
shortness of breath with exertion. Over the weekend her pain
became more diffuse, across the upper abdomen. She then
re-presented on [**9-18**] to [**Hospital6 33**], where workup
included a CT abdomen/pelvis with evidence of pyelonephritis.
She was given a dose of levofloxacin, IV hydromorphone, and a
undefinded amount of IVF. Her labs also showed platelets of 69K,
low WBC, and low hematocrit around 32 (substantially different
from normal values on [**9-14**]). No blood or urine cultures were
obtained. DIC labs were sent and revealed high fibrinogen, a
mildly elevated INR, smear with occasional schistocytes. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her initial vitals were: 100.4F, HR 124, BP
134/92, RR 18, Sat 99% (on room air). Repeat labs again
demonstrated platelets of 60K, stable hematocrit at 31, elevated
D-dimer, fibrinogen pending. Also apparently with new decrease
in renal function. Heme-onc was called and advised to wait on
anticoagulation; they would see the patient in the ICU.
Clinically, she looks well except for back pain, which has been
responding to hydromorphone. Vitals prior to transfer are:
145/90 100 18 98RA. In the ED she received 3L NS,
Piperacillin/Tazobactam 4.5 gm IV, vancomycin 1gm IV,
hydromorphone, and acetaminophen 1gm.

Review of systems: + chronic headaches with new frontal
headaches for four days. No vision or hearing change. No URI
symptoms. No N/V or diarrhea. No blood in stool. No
constipation. Mild urinary urgency on friday, no dysuria, or
hematuria. Mild ankle swelling s/p sprain. No weakness. ""razor
burn on legs"" Pt reports easy bruising.  H/o bleeding with TAH
requiring repeat operation for internal bleeding. No h/o of
bleeding with dental work. no history of clots.

Radiology AND OTHER STRATEGIES
===============================
ECG [**2125-9-18**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Poor R wave progression is probably a normal
variant.
Diffuse T wave changes that are non-specific. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

Chest Radiograph [**2125-9-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema. Small left effusion.

Ultrasound of Abdomen [**2125-9-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged and heterogeneous left kidney, consistent with given
history of
pyelonephritis, with a number of hypoechoic areas in the upper
pole
potentially suspicious for abscess. No evidence of
hydronephrosis.
2. Nondistended gallbladder with gallbladder wall edema likely
secondary to
third spacing. No specific son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for
cholecystitis.
3. The CBD is dilated measuring 0.8 cm without intrahepatic bile
dilatation.
4. Patent portal vein.

CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/Contrast [**2125-9-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe acute left pyelonephritis with marked renal edema,
evolving foci of hypoperfusion, parenchymal necrosis,
inflammatory phlegmon or early abscess formation.
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in the left
lower lobe.
In the setting of infection, these could reflect septic emboli
or other
infectious processes. Followup chest CT to document resolution
is
recommended.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and basilar consolidations could
reflect
atelectasis and/or superimposed pneumonia.
4. Gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid and
pericholecystic hepatic parenchymal hyperemia, unchanged from
prior ultrasound. While these findings are felt likely reactive
in the setting of other abnormalities (particularly since the
gallbladder does not appear distended), by imaging this is
equivocal for acute cholecystitis, and therefore if there is
clinical concern a HIDA scan may be considered.

MRI Abdomen W and W/O Contrast [**2125-9-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute infarction involving much of the upper pole and
interpolar region of the left kidney, coexistent pyelonephritis
is possible. Two small discrete regions of fluid signal
intensity may be explained by necrosis, although abscess
formation cannot be excluded.
2. Irregularity of bilateral renal arteries though confidence in
that finding is low due to motion and potential artifact -
fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis can have this appearance.
A repeat study of the renal arteries is suggested when the
patient is more stable.
3. Gallbladder wall edema is commonly seen with third spacing of
fluid.
Common bile duct dilated to 9 mm, but has normal distal smooth
tapering and
there is no evidence of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis and/or
consolidation at the lung bases.

CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2125-9-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacity primarily within the bilateral
upper lobes.
Differential diagnosis includes atypical infectious pneumonia,
such as PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 84655**] pneumonia and pulmonary edema/hemorrhage.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
3. Emphysematous changes.

TTE [**2125-9-24**]:
Conclusions
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium. A
patent foramen ovale is present. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-9-18**], a
patent foramen ovale is seen.

MRA Kidney W/ and W/O Contrast [**2125-9-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged left kidney, with large, wedge-shaped areas of
liquefactive
necrosis at the upper pole and interpolar region. The areas of
involvement
are unchanged in size and appearance. While abscesses cannot be
completely
excluded, the presence of preserved capsular enhancement, and
the absence of extensive edema or perinephric inflammatory
changes is more consistent with multifocal infarct. Given the
clinical presentation, MR findings are most consistent with
multiple renal infarcts in the setting of pyelonephritis.
2. Normal renal vasculature, with no abnormalities of the renal
arteries to
suggest fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis. Widely patent
left renal vein without filling defect.
3. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions with
atelectasis.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2125-9-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of DVT in the lower extremities.

CTA Chest W/ and W/O Contrast [**2125-9-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection.
2. Resolved right pleural effusion and persistent but now
slightly loculated moderate left pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis.
3. Decreased ground-glass opacification in the background of
persistent
emphysema.
4. Incompletely characterized right kidney abnormality

RUQ Ultrasound [**2125-9-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Non-distended gallbladder, with no pericholecystic fluid or
cholelithiasis. No specific son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for
cholecystitis.
2. Persistent dilatation of the common bile duct without
intrahepatic bile
duct dilatation. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for choledocholithiasis
within the
visualized common duct.

Chest Radiograph [**2125-10-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Small stable left pleural effusion, with no evidence
of
pneumothorax.

MRI Abdomen W/ and W/O Contrast [**2125-10-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No new areas of infarction within the left kidney compared to
multiple
prior studies. Areas of T2 signal hyperintensity within the
lateral
interpolar region and upper pole of the left kidney
corresponding to stable
areas of absent contrast enhancement in addition to striated
enhancement
within the left lower pole. These findings represent features of
both
pyelonephritis and infarction. Small vessel vasculitis should be
included in the differential.
2. Resolution of right pleural effusion with decrease in size of
small left
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
37 year old female with acute onset thyrombocytopenia and sepsis
likely secondary to renal infarction and pyelonephritis.

1) SIRS/Sepsis: Patient initially presented with left flank
pain, tachycardia, low WBC, and low platelets. Based on OSH
non-contrast CT scan it appeared this was consistent with
pyelonephritis. She was started on cefepime, flagyl and
vancomycin [**9-19**]. With concern for worsening abdominal pain a
repeat contrast abdominal and pelvic CT was performed. It showed
severe acute left pyelonephritis with marked renal edema and
evolving foci of hypoperfusion, parenchymal necrosis,
inflammatory phlegmon or early abscess formation.  Urology was
consulted given concern for a need for acute surgical
management.  They suggested a concern for renal vein/artery
thrombosis due to the appearance of multifocal necrosis in the
kidney.  MRI revealed no acute thrombosis but was suggestive of
an acute infarction involving much of the upper pole and
interpolar region of the left kidney without being able to rule
out coexistent pyelonephritis.  The patient's white count
eventually trended up from a nadir of 2.5 to the 9's and she was
transitioned from cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole to
oral ciprofloxacin.  All cultures remained negative but she did
complete a fourteen day course of antibiotics for a suspected
pyelonephritis.  Vasculitis was also considered as an etiology
for her SIRS but no clear evidence for a particular syndrome was
found.  Her blood pressures stabilized and she was completely
hemodynamically stable for > 1 wk prior to discharge.  She did
remain febrile despite negative cultures, which was thought most
likely due to inflammation secondary to her necrotic kidney.
Prior to discharge her fever curve had been trending down and
she did not become more febrile after antibiotics were stopped.
Cultures similarly remained negative.  Repeat MRI of kidney was
obtained to look for an abscess or closed space infection and
was negative.

2) Left renal infarcts: Given patient's family history of factor
V leiden mutation there was some concern that she could have a
thrombophilia predisposing her to clot. Agitated saline TTE
revealed a PFO, which raised concern for paradoxical
embolization but work up for VTE was unremarkable.  Severe
pyelonephritis could also cause renal infarction but as reported
above cultures never impressively reenforced a pyelonephritis.
Similarly septic emboli were thought extremely unlikely given
persistently negative blood cultures.  Investigation for factor
V leiden mutation was negative and no clear reason for
hypercoagulability was found.  The patient was nevertheless
anticoagulated as the benefits of anticoagulation were felt to
outweigh the risks.  Therefore, she was started on coumadin and
discharged on this as well as enoxaparin for bridge as she was
not yet therapeutic.  Renal function remained essentially stable
after the patient was hydrated on her day of presentation.  The
patient will follow up in hematology for further
hypercoagulability work-up.

3) Thrombocytopenia:  The patient was transferred partially due
to concern for DIC or TTP due to her thrombocytopenia.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted and thought  low platelets
were not consistent with DIC or TTP and she did not have
diagnostic numbers of schistocytes or a low fibrinogen.  Most
likely etiology of her thrombocytopenia was thought to be marrow
suppression secondary to SIRS/sepsis.  Ultimately her platelet
count recovered and was normal at the time of discharge.  She
did receive one unit of platelets during an IJ placement.

4)Pulmonary edema/Pleural effusions: Initial CXR showed
pulmonary edema with a small pleural effusion. A BNP was 6587.
An echocardiogram was performed with concern for cardiovascular
compromise and it showed a normal ejection fraction, normal wall
motion, and 1+MR. It was felt the patient's pulmonary edema and
effusions were secondary to fluid resuscitation.  She had one
episode of desaturation to 88% when she laid flat in her CT
scan. She intermittently required 2 Liters NC for comfort. Her
difficulty breathing was felt to be due to her abdominal pain
causing pain upon deep inspiration and fluid overload. Her pain
was controlled and patient was auto-diuresing >150cc/hr upon
transfer to the floor. She continued to auto-diurese on the
floor and eventually came off of oxygen entirely.  Better pain
control significantly improved her respiratory function and
prior to discharge her pulmonary exam was normal and she was
ambulating without desaturations.  CT showed a persistent,
loculated pleural effusion, and given persistent fevers, a
thoracentesis was attempted but as the effusion was steadily
decreasing in size interventional pulmonology and interventional
radiology thought it was too small to drain safely.  As it
continued to decrease in size and the patient WBC count and
fevers were down trending this was not pursued further.

5) Abdominal pain: This was initially controlled with morphine
and morphine SR.  She appeared to be very drowsy and her RR
decreased on this regimen, so the ms contin was discontinued.
She continued to have significant pain, so a morphine PCA,
maximum dose of 4 mg/hr, that was started and the patient's pain
improved significantly. It was assessed that her pain was
consistent with post-embolization syndrome, which includes
fever, abdominal pain secondary to the clearance process of
necrotic tissue.  Eventually she was reestablished on a regimen
of morphine SR, morphine IR, and gabapentin with good
improvement in her pain.  She will likely need these for the
next few months as her body clears necrotic tissue from her
kidney.

6) Persistent sinus tachycardia: The patient informs us that she
has exhibited fast heart rates for years.  The patient did not
appear volume down as her CVP remained high. It was felt that
the tachycardia was due to pain, fever and the overall stress
response of sepsis. The tachycardia improved to the low 100s
after the administration of the PCA and remained there through
the day of discharge.

7) GERD: PPI held in setting of decreased plts. Ranitidine [**Hospital1 **]
started and then discontinued when platelet count recovered as
it was thought this was no longer indicated.

The patient had a PICC for IV access that was discontinued prior
to discharge.  She was tolerating a full diet prior to
discharge.  She was full code.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with back pain and were found
to have had injuries due to poor blood flow to parts of your
kidney.  It is unclear exactly why this occurred but we suspect
you may have some predisposition toward forming blood clots.
Therefore, you have been started on blood thinners to prevent
futher such events.  You have been started on coumadin as a long
term blood thinner, you are being discharged on enoxaparin, a
blood thinner, while we await your coumadin level to be
therapeutic.  You will need to see a hematologist as an
outpatient to complete your clotting disorder workup.

You had fevers in the hospital.  Because of the imaging findings
in your kidney we could not rule out a kidney infection.
Therefore, you received 14 days of therapy for a presumed kidney
infection.  You completed this prior to discharge.  Your
continued fevers and pain are likely due to an inflammatory
reaction as your body breaks down the portions of kidney tissue
that died.  You can take acetaminophen for these fevers as
needed.  Unfortunately, this inflammatory reaction also causes
pain, which we have treated with multiple pain medicines.

You will need follow up with a primary care provider and
coumadin clinic to follow how thin your blood is.  You will also
need follow up with a kidney doctor to follow your kidney
function, a hematologist to assess you for a predisposition to
clotting and help manage this, and a rheumatologist as some of
your tests suggest a possible autoimmune disorder.  We have
scheduled these appointments for you.

Your medications have been changed.  You have been started on
coumadin, a blood thinner, that you will need to take until your
are told to stop by a doctor.  Your blood has not yet been
thinned enough by coumadin so you are also being discharged on
ENOXAPARIN(LOVENOX), which will keep your blood thin until your
coumadin levels are adequate.  When your coumadin levels are
adequate for 24 hours you can stop the enoxaparin.  You have
also been started on MORPHINE sustained release and immediate
release for pain.  You should not drive while using these
medications as they can make you sleepy.  You were also started
on GABAPENTIN (NEURONTIN) to help manage your pain.

Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or any change from
your baseline health status

History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old man with schizophrenia, HTN, and G6PD
deficiency presenting with 2-3 days of increasing intermittent
abdominal pain. Reportedly was having diarrhea at Group Home,
though pt states he has not had bowel movement in 4 days, no
hematochezia. He states that abdominal pain comes on suddenly,
[**9-16**] and sharp in quality, when he drinks fluids, lasts for a
few seconds and self-resolves. Has not been able to eat in the
last 2-3 days due to decreased appetite. No fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Lives at group home.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 73 114/69 16 95% on ?RA. Vitals
stable at triage but became increasingly unresponsive,
responding to painful stimuli. Pupils 2mm, minimally reactive.
Patient was given 0.4 narcan, and appeared to transiently be a
little more alert, though he appeared to sometimes respond to
sternal rub even without narcan for 30-60 seconds. He received a
total of 2mg narcan in the ED. FAST ultrasound showed small
ascites, pericardial effusion, but no signs of tamponade. CT

Social History:
Patient originally from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 466**] [**Country 467**], [**Country 480**]. Moved here 30 yrs
ago. Currently lives in Group Home. Works as cab driver for
30yrs. Educated through 8 years of elementary and middle school
in [**Country 480**]. Did one year of training in electronics here but
could not find a job, so continued as a cab driver. He is not
married, has no kids. Has 2 brothers and 2 sisters in [**Name (NI) 480**],
not well in touch with his family back home.
States that he is given meds at Group Home three days/week
(Wed/Thurs/Fri), and he takes meds himself the other four days
of the week.
Tobacco: Smoked x 30yrs, quit 2wks ago
Marijuana: Smoked x 20yrs, states he quit 10yrs ago b/c too
expensive. (per OMR, he has smoked marijuana prior to ED visits
in [**2173**])
ETOH: reportedly none
Illicits: no IV drug use or cocaine use


Family History:
No known family history of kidney, liver, cardiac disorders, but
patient not well in touch with family.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 97.8 BP: 140/82 P: 72 R: 21 O2: 92%RA
General: Alert, oriented x3, no acute distress, decreased
attention-- unable to list months of year backwards (able to
state [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 359**])
HEENT: Sclera mildly icteric, mildly dry mucus membranes,
oropharynx clear; lower lip appears large (but pt states this is
his normal)
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated
Lungs: Does not give good inspiratory effort, but soft rhonchi
at bilateral bases
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, early systolic
murmur [**3-15**] loudest at LUSB
Abdomen: moderately distended, non-tender, hypoactive bowel
sounds, no rebound tenderness or guarding
Ext: warm, well perfused, trace pulses, 1+ peripheral leg edema



Pertinent Results:
CXR - [**2178-6-9**]
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, with bronchovascular crowding and
possible superimposed mild edema. No focal consolidation noted.

.
CT -abdomen [**2178-6-9**]
1. Diffuse small bowel wall edema. No pneumatosis. DDx includes
reactive due to ascites/hypoproteinemia; mesenteric ischemia,
although no atherosclerotic disease; angioedema due to ACE-I
2. Normal size of AAA
3. Cardiomegaly with large pericardial effusion
4. Moderate-large ascites, new from [**2178-10-3**].
5. Nodular patchy opacities at lung bases, right > left, in
bronchovascular distribution suggest aspiration
6. Vicarious excretion of contrast via gallbladder and oral
contrast in the large bowel suggest recent prior imaging, not at
our institution.
.
CT HEAD [**2178-6-9**]
1. No acute intracranial process
2. Hypoattenuation in the bilateral periventricular white matter
may be sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease but
has progressed from [**2173**] and is greater than expected in this
age group.
.
EKG: [**2178-6-9**]
NSR, rate 69, LVH, borderline LAD, inverted T waves in V-V4,
biphasic T waves in V5. (changed from prior)
.
TTE [**2178-6-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2167-1-7**], the degree of LVH is now moderate.
There is now a very small pericardial effusion (without
tamponade).
.
CXR [**2178-6-11**]: Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung
volumes. Pulmonary edema is mild-to-moderate, has worsened.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small and new or newly apparent.

.
RUQ US [**2178-6-11**]: IMPRESSION: Initial four quadrant ultrasound did
not demonstrate enough free fluid for paracentesis. This
suggests that prior ascites may have shifted. Note is also made
of sludge in the gallbladder with nonobstructive non-shadowing
small stones. Previously visualized focal lesion at the liver
dome is not visualized as no focal hepatic lesions are
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
30 yo male with HTN, hypokalemia, CKDIII, h/o untreated positive
PPD presents with few days abdominal pain that has now resolved
with 2-3 months weight loss, bilateral leg edema, anorexia found
to have anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure,
hypoalbuminemia, symmetric diffuse lymphadenopathy and volume
overload with exam suggestive of acute diastolic heart failure.
Concerned for neoplastic and, chronic inflammatory, or
infectious processes.
.
# Acute diastolic heart failure: He was noted to be in acute
diastolic heart failure on transfer from the ICU. He was given
lasix 40 mg iv x 1, and continued on a 20 mg iv daily regimen,
then was transitioned to 40mg PO daily. Daily weights and I/O's
were followed. His blood pressure was controlled as below; in
particular, he was started on beta blocker, resumed on an ACEI
(which he apparently did not fill at his pharmacy), and started
on spironolactone as well. His O2 requirement was weaned off.
.
# Hypoalbuminemia: possibly renal or primary GI. Nothing on
history to suggest primary GI protein losing enteropathy though
this should be considered (i.e. celiac sprue, lymphoma, IBD,
amyloid etc.) especially in light of improving renal function
which argues against primary renal protein loss, low albumin,
absence of known liver disease and weight loss. SPEP/UPEP
negative. Anti-TTG IgA negative. Pt should discuss need for
colonoscopy with his PCP given anemia, weight loss and age.
.
# Gram positive bacteremia, unclear source: He was initially
started on vanc, but this was d/c'd when this culture latered
speciated with coagulase negative staph. No subsequent cultures
had growth.
.
#non-specific enteritis-seen on CT scan. This likely explains
reports of abdominal pain and diarrhea recently. Pt's abdominal
pain resolved. He did not have diarrhea and stool studies were
negative. Symptoms resolved and pt was tolerating a regular
diet.
.
# Weight Loss - 25-30lb. Large DDx. Concerning for primary
neoplastic vs. GI-infectious vs. GI/systemic infectious. See
above. Nothing on history/exam to suggest primary rheumatologic
disorder, ESR 13, [**Doctor First Name **] negative. He was scheduled for a lymph
node biopsy (his R inguinal lymph node seemed the largest),
excisional by surgery. However, he refused this. Contact[**Name (NI) **] legal
guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as PCP regarding this issue. Pt
initially stated he did not have enlarged lymph nodes. However,
later on he stated that he knew the reason to biopsy the lymph
nodes was to look for ""cancer"" and then stated that he would
never have a biospy. Discussed this with patient's PCP and legal
guardian who did not want to force (by physical or chemical
restraint) the patient to undergo a procedure against his will.
Discussed possibility of biopsy with the patient multiple times
and he did decline, but agrees to follow up with his PCP for
further evaluation.
.
# Acute Renal Failure w/ proteinuria: Lack of schistocytes on
initial smear argued against TTP etiology. Likely pre-renal,
perhaps due to poor po intake. unclear if he was hypotensive in
the ED. FENa suggested prerenal etiology. Creatinine improved to
baseline. He should have chemistries/electrolytes followed after
discharge. Creatinine on discharge 1.6.
.
# Altered mental status, from opiates received in the ED now
resolved. He was initially admitted to the ICU given his
unresponsiveness after opiates. This resolved after being given
narcan and never reoccurred.
.
# Anemia - His B12, folate, and iron were normal. Smear was
checked in ICU and only rare schistocytes were seen. HIV Ab was
negative. His hematocrit was stable on monitoring and was 30.1
on day of discharge without evidence of bleeding. This is likely
due CKD. However, given recent abdominal pain and anemia pt
should undergo a colonoscopy.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - He was found to have thrombocytopenia,
thought to be subacute, given that he had 130K one month ago.
His platelets were monitored and normalized. Splenomegaly not
noted on imaging. HIV negative. Could have been due to
medications or acute illness.
.
# Ascites - new finding. Had not been tapped b/c ICU felt not
tappable. No known chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.
Considered lymphoma, occult cirrhosis, TB peritonitis on
differential given +PPD, abdominal pain, weight loss. TB
enteritis normal affects IC valve area which he does not
radiographically/clinically have. RUQ US was without significant
ascites, not enough to tap; no cirrhosis noted. This could be
due to heart failure, but is likely due to low albumin.
Quantiferon gold PENDING at time of discharge.
.
# Hypertension - He was continued on his home regimen, although
it was found that he wasn't filling these prescriptions as an
outpt. Given proteinuria, he was (re-)started on an ACE-I. He
was also started on spironolactone given his heart failure and
hypertension (after drawing renin and aldosterone). He was
started on beta blocker given dCHF.
- With chronic hypokalemia, sent renin / aldosterone levels
since these have never been sent, to rule out
hyperaldonsteronism. These are still PENDING at time of
discharge.
.
# Hypokalemia- see above, concern for hyperaldo. Repleted dialy.
Pt started on spironolactone and still required supplementation
of potassium. Suggested to decrease home potassium regimen by
[**2-8**] given CKD and use of spironolactone. Pt should have his
potassium checked regularly.
.
# Lymphadenopathy - bilateral inguinal and axillary. He denied
fevers and chills, but noted weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, ahnd
elevated LDH,  suggested biopsy to r/o TB, lymphoma (with flow
cytommetry), etc.  Surgery prepared for excisional biopsy of LN,
but pt refused. Pt refused on multiple occasions. See above. PCP
and legal guardian did not want to for pt to undergo procedures
and testing that he did not want. Pt was aware that biopsy was
suggested to r/o cancer.
.
# Positive PPD (untreated) - CXR was performed without note of
tuberculous disease INH is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency.
.
# Pericardial Effusion - likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia.
Mild per ECHO (not large as reported on CT), no signs of
tamponade. Other DDx = TB (though usually much larger), other
Rheum disorders (unlikely by hx/exam). This was likely due to
hypoalbumenemia.
.
# Long QT: Present also on EKG [**2178-5-8**]. His potassium was
repleted. QTC remained ~440 with haldol dosing. Serial EKG were
performed. Pt's haldol dose was decreased to 5mg from 10mg due
to this. EKG's should be monitored in outpatient setting.
.
# Lacunar infarct, clincally quiescent: Seen on head CT, and new

since [**2173**]. Would recommend outpatient workup for PFO, etc.
.
# Psych: schizophrenia, formerly pleasant did become
inexplicably agitated about prospect of getting LN biopsy. Pt
found to lack capacity by psychiatry and found to have a legal
guardian-[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]. Pt's guardian was updated on pt's
clinical course and as above did not want to pursue restraints
(physical/chemical) in order to enforce biopsy. Pt was taken off
his depakote during admission given altered mental status and
this should be resumed upon discharge. Pt's haldol was decreased
to 5mg from 10mg given above. Pt remained pleasant throughout
the remainder of the hospitalization.

her mother fall and went immediately to her side. The patient
tripped on the last stair of her home. There was no observed
loss of consciousness and the patient stated at the time of the
fall that she lost her footing on the steps.  At baseline, the
patient has difficulty with her knees that caused her
unsteadiness.  The patient had a left eyebrow laceration from
the fall, but was completely neurologically intact per the

Imaging:
Head CT [**4-2**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Compared to two hours prior, there has
been slight
interval increase in the large left frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, which now measures 7.5 x 3.8 cm in greatest
dimension, previously 6.7 x 3.8 cm. The hemorrhage has now
dissected into the left lateral ventricle with a small amount of
blood also layering within the right lateral ventricle. There is
mass effect on the ventricles, however no evidence of
hydrocephalus. 7 mm of rightward midline shift and subfalcine
herniation are unchanged. Moderately extensive right
parietotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage is stable. The basal
cisterns are preserved with no evidence of uncal herniation. The
left lens is absent. There is no soft tissue hematoma or skull
fracture.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval increase in extent of large left frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, now with extension into the left
lateral ventricle. No evidence of hydrocephalus.
2. Unchanged 7-mm of rightward midline shift.
3. Stable moderate right parietotemporal subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

Head CT [**4-3**]:
IMPRESSION: No significant change compared to eight hours prior
except for
slight redistribution of intraventricular blood products.
Unchanged large
left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and moderate right
subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

Head CT [**4-4**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no significant interval
change in
multiple intracranial hemorrhages. The left frontal
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage measures 7.6 x 4.4 cm, grossly unchanged when
accounting for head position. The moderate right parietotemporal
subarachnoid hemorrhage is also unchanged. Small amount of blood
layering within the ventricles is unchanged. There is no new
hydrocephalus. Subfalcine herniation and 5 mm of rightward
midline shift are stable. Left lens is absent. The calvarium and
soft tissues are normal.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in large left frontal
IPH and
moderate right parietotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No
change in mass
effect or intraventricular extension of blood. No hydrocephalus.


EKG [**4-3**]:
 Sinus rhythm with borderline resting sinus tachycardia. Left
ventricular
hypertrophy by voltage. Inferolateral ST-T wave changes with ST
segment
depressions may be due to ischemia, etc. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2169-4-2**] precordial voltage is more prominent. ST-T wave
changes are
more apparent. Clinical correlation is suggested.

abnormality. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with
secondary repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous

CXR [**4-5**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the
pre-existing left
lower lung opacity has slightly increased in density and evolves
towards a
retrocardiac consolidation. The pre-existing left lower lobe
opacity is of
similar density but slightly more extensive, the changes could
be consistent with bilateral evolving aspiration pneumonia.  The
size of the cardiac silhouette is slightly increased. There is
no evidence of fluid overload. The monitoring and support
devices are unchanged. No evidence of larger pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from OSH with
significantly sized intracranial hemorrhage while on
anticoagulation therapy from previous cardiac surgery. Upon
admission; she was administered platelets and admitted to the
intensive care unit for continuous monitoring. On [**4-3**], repeat
head CT was performed and determined to be stable, and not
indicitative of ongoing hemorrhage. She was subsequently
extubated. On [**4-4**], she was observed to have difficulty managing
her secretions, and an arterial blood gas was performed and
revealed a PaO2 in the 50s, and was reintubated. Head CT was
again performed to evaluate whether the ICH had evolved to
attribute to the poor respiratory effort, but was stable. On
[**4-5**], a bedside mini bronchoscopy was done to evaluate if she
had aspirated any secretions during her period of poor
respiratory effort. A lung consolidation was identified, and
antibiotics were started. On [**4-5**] her exam was stable and social
work was consulted for family regarding the possibility for
trach/peg & DNR/I status.  On [**4-6**] her sodium was 153, mannitol
was stopped, free H2O was increased to 150cc QID, and her exam
was stable.  On [**4-7**] she had a troponin leak 1.19 and a family
meeting w/ palliative care where the conclusion was to make her
CMO and she was eventually extubated and started on morphine for
comfort.  On [**4-8**] she passed away.

CT Head ([**2-16**]):
1. Very small left parietovertex scalp subcutaneous hematoma.
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

of acute ischemia.

CT C-spine ([**2-16**]):
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Moderately severe degenerative changes within the cervical
spine with
grade 1 retrolisthesis of C5 on C6. Given the degenerative
findings, acuity this is likely chronic; however, there is
ventral canal narrowing at this and the C4-C5 level, and MRI of
the cervical spine is recommended if myelopathic symptoms
suggest acute cord injury.
3. Multilevel spinal stenosis secondary to disc bulges and
herniations and
spondylosis.

CT abd/pelvis ([**2-16**]):
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal infection. No acute abdominal
pathology.
2. 13 x 8 mm mural nodule along the right posterior bladder wall

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
82 year-old Spanish speaking female with a history of CAD s/p
recent BMS to RCA, type II DM, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted with hypothermia and
hyponatremia.

# Hypothermia:
# Hypoglycemia:

# Hyponatremia:

# CAD: Recent BMS to RCA, pt was continued on home ASA, plavix,
statin.

# Hypertension: Antihypertensives initially held.  She was
restarted on her BB and [**Last Name (un) **] at lower doses.  They should be
titrated up as needed.

# Atrial fibrillation: Currently in NSR, on coumadin for
anticoagulation.  Lovenox held (had been on lovenox bridge to
coumadin from prior hospitalization) given extensive bruising on
her abdomen.  Coumadin titrated up to 5 mg at time of transfer.


# Mass Along Bladder: On her CT scan from ED, she was noted to
have a mass on the posterior aspect of her bladder concerning
for malignancy.  She had a urine cytology sent which is
currently pending and should have urology follow up for possible
cystoscopy.

# Left toe laceration: Secondary to fall, per preliminary
report, cannot rule out extension into bone. As her hypothermia
has resolved and there is little suscipicion of infection and
her exam benign, further imaging deferred.

82 spanish speaking F with afib, CAD s/p recent BMS to RCA, dm2,
admitted with fall, hyponatremia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia.
Pt initially presnted with hypothermia, bradycardia and
hyponatremia, concerning for hypothyroidism.  TSH however was
wnl.  Sepsis unlikely given pt hemodynamic stable and no clear
source for infection (symptom of dysuria in setting of foley
catheter, clean u/a), adrenal insufficiency also unlikely. Given
negative work up and occurence with hypoglycemia, hypothermic
episode most likely [**2-23**] her hypoglycemic episode.  She received
external warming and her temperature normalized on the first day
of her hospital stay.  Blood and urine cultures remained
negative throughout her ICU stay.

.
1. Fall/ C5-6 retrolisthesis:
Fall sounds mechanical in nature. CT showed C5-6 retrolisthesis.
c-spine was cleared by Neurosurgery in ED. Neuro exam remains
non-focal
- PT consult
- no events on tele except bradycardia - approx 50
.
# Hypothermia:
This resolved with simple warming measures, was likely [**2-23**]
hypoglycemia. There was initial concern for possible sepsis,
though bld cx and urine cx are NGTD. TSH wnl.
.
# Hypoglycemia/Type II Diabetes, controlled with complications:

Hypoglycemia was in setting of poor PO and continued long acting
insulin, now resolved.  Also, it was found that pt's husband
administer's patient's insulin, but does not have a clear method
for calculating dose of insulin, and it appears that pt does not
even check her glucose daily or even weekly.  Nursing spent
significant time educating patient, husband and daughter about
the need for frequent daily glucose monitoring, and the use of a
sliding scale.  Patient was discharged on NPH and sliding scale,
as used during the hospitalization.
Recommend that patient have geriatrics consult with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 713**]
after discharge.

.
# Hyponatremia:
Pt noted to have hypovolemic hyponatremia on admission,
corrected with hydration.  She was encouraged to increase her PO
intake.
 Sodium runs baseline in 130s likely [**2-23**] diuretics.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure, EF 50%:
currently euvolemic
- patient returned to her home dosing of cardiac medications
prior to discharge.
.

# Mass Along Bladder: On her CT scan from ED, she was noted to
have a mass on the posterior aspect of her bladder concerning
for malignancy.  She had a urine cytology sent which is
currently pending and should have urology follow up for possible
cystoscopy.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
intracerebral hemorrhage (transfer from [**Hospital6 204**])

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year-old right-handed man with a history of HTN
and [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with an intracranial
hemorrhage.  He woke at 3AM with severe vertigo, chest pain, and
palpable tachycardia.  He states explicitly that the chest pain
woke him from sleep.  He had a mild headache at that time, but
it
was much less intense than his other symptoms.  He remained in
bed until 5AM with little improvement to his symptoms.  He
attempted to walk to the bathroom but still suffered from severe
vertigo and fell.  He denies injury generally, and specifically
states that he did not strike his head.  After this fall he
called 911 and was transferred to [**Hospital6 204**].  CT
there demonstrated a R. basal ganglia bleed, leading him to be
transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
   Per the ER resident his symptoms have been stable from his
initial presentation at LGH until the present.  Neurosurgery
evaluated him for possible drainage in the ER and felt that no
intervention was indicated at this time.
   He notes that recent glycemic control has been very poor.  On
multiple days over the last week he has had glucoses > 400, and
his high over the last week was >600.

ROS: There have been no changes in vision or hearing, neck pain,
tinnitus, weakness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking,
language, swallowing, eating or gait. General review of systems
was negative for fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight,
energy
level or appetite, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e
incontinence).

Past Medical History:
 - HTN
 - IDDM
 - Industrial exposure to cadmium 15y ago in a workplace
     explosion
 - Failure of at least one kidney - he does not know which
 - Intermittent paralysis of L. or R. arm lasting 2-3 minutes x
     1 year, occurs multiple times per month but has not
     escalated in frequency.
 - Peripheral vascular disease
 - Gout vs. osteoarthritis, given Indomethacin treatment and
     complaint of chronic severe knee pain. Pt does not know
     distinction between these diagnoses.


Social History:
The patient lives alone, is disabled and not working secondary
to diabetes, and has one daughter.

Family History:
Little is known - all family members of his and prior
generations remained in [**Country **] and their later-life histories
are unknown.

third
ventricle. These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
9:45 on

Final Report
INDICATION: Interval evaluation of known parenchymal hemorrhage.


COMPARISON: Outside hospital CT from [**2167-11-27**] at 6:41
a.m.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain without
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were
prepared.

FINDINGS: Again visualized is an unchanged 2.7 x 1.7 cm right
basal ganglia
parenchymal hemorrhage extending into the right lateral
ventricle as well as
the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle and the third
ventricle. A
thin surrounding rim of edema is again noted. There is no shift
of the
normally midline structures. There are no new foci of
hemorrhage,
infarctions, mass effects, or herniation. No fractures are
identified. The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells,
and middle
ear cavities are clear.

IMPRESSION:
Unchanged right basal ganglia hemorrhage extension into the
right lateral
ventricle, frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle and the
third ventricle.
Location and imaging features favor hypertensive hemorrhage,
although CT
cannot entirely exclude underlying vascular malformation or

Provisional Findings Impression: DLrc SAT [**2167-12-5**] 9:49 PM
Slight interval decrease in size of right basal ganglia
hemorrhage with little
change in known intraventricular extension. Stable size of the
ventricular
system.


Final Report
INDICATION: Patient is a 52-year-old male with known
intraventricular,
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with worsening mental status.
Evaluate for
interval change.

EXAMINATION: CT of the head without intravenous contrast.

COMPARISONS: [**2167-12-2**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain. No
intravenous contrast was administered. Multiple sequences were
attempted
secondary to patient motion.

FINDINGS:

Since the prior examination, there has been slight interval
decrease in size of a focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, now
measuring 2.2 x 1.2 cm where previously it measured up to 2.6 cm
in maximal dimension. This area of hemorrhage is centered in the
right basal ganglia and demonstrates extension into the right
lateral ventricle. Overall, there has been slight interval
decrease in hemorrhage filling the right lateral ventricle
extending into the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. The ventricular system is
stable in size and configuration, with the third ventricle
measuring up to 7 mm and the right lateral ventricle measuring
up to 10 mm. There are no new foci of hemorrhage. There is no
evidence of shift of midline structures or transtentorial or
uncal herniation. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved with no evidence of acute territorial infarction. The
bony structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Slight interval decrease in size of right basal
ganglia
hemorrhage with little change in known intraventricular
extension. Stable
size of the ventricular system. As mentioned earlier, while this
can relate to HTN, underlying vascular/neoplastic cause cannot
be excluded and work up accdgly.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
52yo man with longstanding HTN and [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with intracranial hemorrhage, suspected secondary to
hypertensive crisis.  The size of his bleed, the need for
frequent neuro checks, and his need for antihypertensives via
continuous drip necessitate ICU admission.  His Left-sided
sensory symptoms were well-explained by his Right-thalamic
bleed, and there were no symptoms that were unexplained by this
lesion. Although we do not have records of his blood pressure at
the time of EMS contact, the presumptive etiology of this
hemorrhagic infarct is uncontrolled hypertension. Renal consult
was called re. the acute-on-chronic renal failure, and
recommended discontinuing his NSAIDs (taken for ?gout), which
was done, and measuring urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, which
revealed gross proteinuria >5,000.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the floor after several days in the
ICU. Continued issues were blood glucose control (managed with
insulin sliding-scale) and acute renal failure (initially ~2.0
and steady, but then up to 2.7 in the setting of UTI and Cipro
Tx, all above a reported baseline CKD/Cr 1.5), despite IVF and
holding the patient's previous indomethacin. On the floor, he
became more confused and febrile, and was found to have a
gram-negative UTI. Initially, he was treated empirically with
ciprofloxacin, but this worsened his renal failure, and the
patient became febrile and somnolent/lethargic, so he was
switched to IV vancomycin and Zosyn (vancomycin was discontinued
[**12-7**] after UCx from [**12-5**] showed gram-positive bacteria). This
UCx ultimately speciated a pan-sensitive [**Last Name (LF) 88119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] on [**12-8**]
(day of discharge) after 3.5d of treatment with IV Zosyn, he was
switched to PO Bactrim, plan to finish a 7-8d course for
complicated (male) UTI. Fever defervesced rapidly and mental
status improved markedly 1-2d after starting IV antibiotics, and
creatinine began improving after it peaked at 2.7 the day before
discharge (down to 2.5 on [**12-8**]). Blood cultures and a repeat
UCx on [**12-5**] (after first dose of Cipro) have remained no growth
to date.

On the day of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was alert and oriented to
place and date, with stable and normal VS. Breathing comfortably
and BP in good control on current medication regimen, HDS. On
Neurologic examination, his speech was fluent and he exhibited a
stable mild flattening of his Left NLF, but full power in all
tested muscle groups. He is working with PT and getting out of
bed to chair [**Hospital1 **]. His FSBG were in good control (120-150) on
increased dosing of SSI.

Plan:
-follow up in Neurology/[**Hospital 4038**] clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (see
discharge information)
-arrange follow-up with patient's PCP and if PCP agrees,
consider starting him with Nephrology outpatient follow-up in
the near future (chronic kidney disease and now recovering from
acute renal failure and UTI)
-finish 3.5 days more of [**Hospital1 **] Bactrim DS 1 tab PO for complicated
UTI

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory, slowly recovering from stroke


Discharge Instructions:
You had a hemorrhagic stroke, which means that there was
bleeding in your brain. This caused the neurologic symptoms
(sensations, mild weakness) that you experienced. This was
caused by your high blood pressure along with your diabetes,
which need to be kept in better control to prevent future
strokes.

Your kidneys, which were already chronically damaged, were also
injured, at least in part due to the painkiller medicines
(indomethacin and naprosyn) that you were taking every day. This
was also related to a urinary tract infection you developed here
in the hospital, which is being treated by antibiotic medication
that will continue for 3 more days.

Followup Instructions:
(1) With Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in Vascular Neurology (stroke) clinic
on <<Tuesday, [**1-12**] at 2:00pm>> at the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] clinical

History of Present Illness:
 This is a 51 year-old Female with a stage IV breast cancer with
mets to liver who was admitted to ACS on [**2122-7-13**] with a port line
infection which was subsequently removed on [**2122-7-13**]. Initial
blood cultures grew MSSA and Enterococcus and she was started on
Vancomycin. She was then transferred to the medicine service on
[**2122-7-20**] for bacteremia management and progressive dyspnea. She
received a TEE on [**2122-7-21**] that was negative for vegetations.
Chest imaging revealed bilateral loculated pleural effusions
prompting left VATS and chest tube placement on [**2122-7-21**] with the
pleural fluid growing MSSA. Her shortness of breath progressed
and she required up to 4L NC. She had a CTA on [**2122-7-23**] that did
not reveal central or lobar PE, but segmental/subsegmental PE
could not be ruled out. She was briefly started on heparin, but
this was discontinued due to persistent right sided empyema as
leading cause of hypoxia. Her antibiotic coverage was broadened
to Vancomycin and Zosyn the night of [**2122-7-23**]. Blood cultures
negative since [**2122-7-17**], left sided pleural fluid growing MSSA.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 51 year-old Female with a stage IV breast cancer with
mets to liver who was admitted to ACS on [**2122-7-13**] with a port line
infection which was subsequently removed on [**2122-7-13**]. Initial
blood cultures grew MSSA and Enterococcus and she was started on
Vancomycin. She was then transferred to the medicine service on
[**2122-7-20**] for bacteremia management and progressive dyspnea. She
received a TEE on [**2122-7-21**] that was negative for vegetations.
Chest imaging revealed bilateral loculated pleural effusions
prompting left VATS and chest tube placement on [**2122-7-21**] with the
pleural fluid growing MSSA. Her shortness of breath progressed
and she required up to 4L NC. She had a CTA on [**2122-7-23**] that did
not reveal central or lobar PE, but segmental/subsegmental PE
could not be ruled out. She was briefly started on heparin, but
this was discontinued due to persistent right sided empyema as
leading cause of hypoxia. Her antibiotic coverage was broadened
to Vancomycin and Zosyn the night of [**2122-7-23**]. Blood cultures
negative since [**2122-7-17**], left sided pleural fluid growing MSSA.
.
She subsequently had right sided VATS with chest tube placement
on [**2122-7-24**]. The pleural fluid demonstrated frank purulence.
During the procedure the patient required Levophed support and
in the PACU, SBP remained in 80's, MAPs 60's despite 2L LR.
Phenylephrine gtt was started, which was switched to Levophed
gtt. She received IV dilaudid for pain control.
.
Upon evaluation in the PACU, she was lethargic, awaking to
voice, but with poor attention and not answering questions
coherently, intermittently moaning in pain. Respirations were
unlabored and an ABG obtained prior to transfer was 7.38/42/164.
She was transfered to the MICU with 5 chest tubes in place and
requiring pressor support. The patient continued IV antibiotic
treatment with vancomycin.
.
The patient was transferred back to the medicine floor on [**7-27**]
from the MICU. The patient was briefly transitioned to Nafcillin
on [**7-31**]; however, subsequent blood work revealed [**Last Name (un) **] and likely
AIN, with Cr plateauing at 1.9, up from her baseline of 1.1-1.4.
This prompted the patient's return to Vancomycin.

In brief, the summary of the patient's active issues at
discharge:

51F with metastatic stage IV breast CA admitted to ACS for
port-line infection with subsequent removal of line, found to
have MSSA/Enterococcal bacteremia, and development of B/L
empyemas s/p multiple chest tubes who required MICU admission
for hypotension, previously on pressors.
.
# Fluid balance - The patient's hypotension resolved shortly
before transfer to the floor on [**2122-7-27**]. Her BP has been stable
on the medicine floor, with SBPs ranging from 120s to 140s.
During the patient's stay in the hospital, she became gradually
more edematous, with upper and lower extremity anasarca. Pt's
Albumin was noted to be at 2. Pt developed [**Last Name (un) **] with CR 1.9 after
lasix diuresis and nafcillin induction on [**8-31**]. Eos in urine on
[**7-31**], since resolved, prompted concern for AIN. The patient has
been transitioned back to Vancomycin, and her renal function has
been stable. The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on
Vancomycin. Per our renal consult, we started the patient on [**Hospital1 **]
albumin (25g IV) chased one hour after with 10mg lasix. This
promoted successful diuresis, and the patient has been stable on
this regimen.

# BILATERAL EMPYEMAS, CHEST TUBES, DYSPNEA - Pt was noted to
have increasing dyspnea, and bilateral pleural effusions were
noted on [**2122-7-19**]. CT confirmed the presence of loculated pleural
effusions. Pt is s/p bilateral VATS on the left side [**2122-7-21**] and
the right side on [**2122-7-24**]. Pt received b/l drainage and pleural
biopsy. 2 chest tubes were placed on the left side [**2122-7-21**] amd 3
were placed on the right side [**2122-7-24**]. The last chest tube was
successfully removed on [**2122-7-29**], and subsequent CXR has shown no
return of effusions with notmal lung spaces. Cultures from
empyemas were positive for MSSA. Pt's dyspnea resolved s/p VATS.

*Atypical epithelial cells recovered from VATS suspicious for
malignancy.
- Thoracic surgery recs - F/u as outpatient, appointment made
for [**2122-8-13**].
Pt's pain has been effectively controlled with Dilaudid PO 4 mg
Q4H PRN; oxycodone 20 mg PO BID. Pt has been relatively pain
free with only ocasional need for the Dilaudid.
.
# Port infection - PT was admitted for a port infection on
[**2122-7-13**] to acute care surgery. She had her port removed, with the
area debrided. Wet to dry dressings have been applied to the
surgical site, with marked improvement of the wound. There has
been no return of purulence since surgery, and her penrose drain
was removed [**2122-7-15**]. The wound shows evidence of good granulation
tissue. Cultures from the infected port grew MSSA.

# ANEMIA - evidence of downward trending hematocrit is likely
due to worsening chronic disease. Pt has been consistently
guaiac negative, and a hemolytic work-up was negative for
hemolysis. At time of discharge, Pt's hematocrit is at 25. Since
returning from the ICU, pt has received 2 units of blood on
[**7-31**], with hematocrit stable at 25 since.

# METASTATIC BREAST CANCER - faslodex 500mg IM was given to the
patient on [**2122-8-3**]. Her next dose is due on [**2122-8-31**].
Atypical epithelial cells suspicious for malignancy were present
in tissue taken from pleural empyema. B/L empyemas may have had
a malignant component.
.
# CONSTIPATION - Pt initially constipated, but has been stable
on current bowel regimen of docusate, miralax, bisacodyl, and
senna.

# ANXIETY - Pt has complained of anxiety, but has been stable on
Lorazepam 1 mg PO Q8hrs for anxiety.
.
# FEN: Regular diet with supplementation of carnation instant
breakfast in between meals for added nutrition.

swelling of lips

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
47F with asthma/COPD, atopic dermatitis, HTN on ACEI, GERD who
comes with facial swelling. She was in her prior state of health
until yesterday afternoon when she started noticing mild facial
swelling. She went to bed and was doing fine, but when she woke
up at the normal time she noticed worsening of her lip swelling
to the point she was unable to open her mouth. She denies any
wheezing, stridor, shortness of breath and states that has been
on Lisinopril 20 mg for long time. She denies fever, chills,
changes in her voice, drooling, neck pain, hoarseness or any
other upper airway symptoms.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted for abdominal pain and
negative work up including CT abdomen, right upper quadrant
ultrasound, and HIDA scan were all performed and within normal
limits. Diet was advanced without difficulty, and patient was
placed on aggressive bowel regimen with daily bowel movement.
She was discharged home 3 days ago.
.
In the ER her initial VS were T 97.4 F, HR 58 BPM, BP 126/79
mmHg, RR 16 X', SpO2 100% on RA. She was breathing comfortably,
but there was a lot of difficulty examining her mouth. ENT and
anesthesia were called to assess patient. ENT tried scoping her
to assess for vocal cord swelling, but she did not tolerate
procedure secondarely to anxiety and dyscomfort. ER tried giving
5 mg of midazolam and re-doing procedure, but patient was still
unable to tolerate it. Then, given patient's breathing being
stable ENT decided to preoceed with medications only and
observation for 1 hour in the ER. Pt received 125 mg of IV
solumedrol, 20 mg of IV famotidine, 25 mg of IV diphenydramine
and epipen x2 (its unclear if first one went in, so [**Name (NI) **] repeated
the dose). She was stable for 1 hour and then is admitted to the
ICU for monitoring. She is has a tough access and ER could only
get a small IV in R forearm (that is why they gave epineprhine
IM).

Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 15174**] for treatment of
altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 52 year old woman with past medical history
significant for chronic pain on narcotics and benzodiazepines,
malabsorption syndrome due to complications of gastric bypass
surgery, and severe osteoporosis.  Three days prior to her
admission to the outside hospital, the patient presented to her
PCP's office for evaluation of ~20 pound weight loss that had
occurred over the past 6-8 weeks.  The patient was found to have
a urinary tract infection, and she was prescribed Ciprofloxacin.
 The patient took two doses of the antibiotic.  The following
day, the patient's husband noted that his wife seemed very
nervous and agitated.  He called the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] advised the
patient to discontinue the Ciprofloxacin.  That evening, the
patient's husband noted that the patient was laughing
inappropriately while she watched TV.  She thought the TV was
""talking to her.""  The patient's husband called 911, but by the
time the EMTs arrived at their home, the patient was able to
answer questions correctly, and she refused to go to the
hospital.  The following morning, the patient was noted to be
more agitated, paranoid, and delusional, so her huaband called
911 again.  This time, the patient was taken to
[**Hospital3 15174**].
   On presentation to the outside hospital, the patient was
noted to have a low grade temperature (100.2). Her neurologic
exam was reported as ""non-focal,"" and a non-contrast head CT was
negative for bleed. The patient's tox screen was negative for
ETOH.  Her other laboratory data was unremarkable.  The patient
was admitted to the hospital for treatment of narcotic
withdrawal.
   During her 36 hour hospitalization, the patient was given two
doses of Buprenex.  Subsequently, the patient became lethargic,
confused, combative, and agitated.  She was transferred to the
ICU for further management.  She was given a few doses of Haldol
and Ativan for her agitation.  Lumbar puncture was unsuccessful.
 Given her persistent agitation and concern for narcotic
withdrawal, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for
further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 12258**]): Pt had an LP and the results of
the CSF analysis were unremarkable. Her mental status improved
in ICU and she became much more alert and was oriented by the
morning of the second hospital day. While in the ICU, the
chronic pain service was consulted. Their recommendations are
noted below.

2. Altered mental status: As above, the pt. underwent a lumbar
puncture, the results of which were not suggestive of CNS
infection as the cause of her encephalopathy.  A TSH, B12 and
electrolytes were sent which were all within normal limits. An
RPR was sent and was nonreactive. Upon further discussion with
the pt. when she became more alert, it was discovered that after
taking the first two doses of ciprofloxacin the week prior to
admission, the pt. became extremely nauseous and had episodes of
emesis and diarrhea.  This led the pt. to stop taking her
narcotics which she is on chronically for pain.  Thus, it was
believed that the pt's. altered mental status was secondary to
narcotics withdrawal.  It should be noted, however, that
ciprofloxacin has been associated with acute psychosis,
seizures, and acute delirium.

3. Chronic pain: The pt. reported that she had been on large
doses of oxycontin, valium and neurontin for pain in her right
shoulder, back and legs prior to admission.  In the context of
her heavy narcotics use, a chronic pain service consult was
obtained while the pt. was in the intensive care unit.  They
recommended stopping oxycontin and decreasing the dose of
valium.  In addition, they recommended continuing neurontin and
adding methadone.  The pt. initially tolerated this regimen
well.  However, on the fourth hospital day, the pt. continued to
complain of leg spasms.  Baclofen was introduced with some
success in relieving her spasms.
The pain service also recommended that the pt. be started on
celecoxib for musculoskeletal pain but this was held over the
concern of possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the
setting of iron deficiency anemia of yet uncertain etiology.

4. Iron deficiency anemia:  The pt. was found to have profound
iron deficiency anemia on admission.  Further discussion with
the pt. and her PCP revealed that the pt. has known iron
deficiency and has received supplementation in the past.  A
gastroenterology consult was called.  They had recommended
performing both colonoscopy to examine for occult malignancy
(especially in the face of recent unintentional weight loss and
cachexia) and an EGD to evaluate the anatomy of her upper GI
tract in light of her prior gastric bypass.  The pt. did not
desire to undergo these procedures during this inpatient
hospitalization, but agreed to follow-up for these studies on an
outpatient basis.  The importance of following-up regarding this
issue was explicitly stressed to the pt. prior to discharge.
She was discharged on 325mg of ferrous sulfate once per day.

5. Weight loss/cachexia/?malabsorption:  In light of the pt's.
~20 pounds over the 6 to 8 weeks prior to admission, a nutrition
consult was obtained.  They had recommended TPN in addition to
encouraging the pt. to increase her p.o. intake.  The pt. did
received three days of TPN through a PICC line in addition to a
regular diet.  There was, again, concern over occult malignancy
which further prompted the desire to perform a colonoscopy.  A
breast exam was also performed as a part of a malignancy work-up
and was unremarkable.  The pt. stated that she has had a
""negative"" mammography within the last year.
The gastroenterology service also raised the possibility of
celiac disease and tTG-IgA and endomysial antibodies were sent
and were pending at the time of discharge.
There is also the possibility that her weight loss is secondary
to her profound depression with vegetative symptoms.

6. Depression: The pt. admitted to severe depression in the
months prior to admission.  As such, the psychiatry service was
consulted.  They recommended re-starting fluoxetine which was
done at a dose of 20mg per day.

7. Osteoporosis: The pt. was started on calcium and vitamin D
supplementation.

8. Migraine Headaches: The pt. complained of headache suggestive
of typical (not classical) migraine.  Her pain was not relieved
with acetaminophen.  A trial of subcutaneous sumatriptan,
however, did provide relief.  She was discharged with a
prescription for subcutaneous sumatriptan with instructions to
stop taking the medication if she experienced flushing,
dizziness, fatigue (suggestive of serotonin syndrome due to
concomitant use of fluoxetine).

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 57F heavy smoker with recent admission [**2112-10-1**] - [**2112-10-3**]
with
chest and abdominal pain and odynophagia who was found to have
circumferential mural thrombus in the supra-renal aorta on cross
sectional imaging. At that time the aortic pathology was though
to be chronic. Ultimately, her pain resolved with the initiation
of a PPI and GI cocktail, and was discharged home after a 3 day
hospital stay. On [**10-6**] she again presented to an OSH with
abdominal pain where a CT abdomen was done which showed an
aortic
dissection. She was emergently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where a CTA
of the torso confirmed an aortic dissection of the descending
thoracic aorta (at the level of the left pulmonary vein) to just
below the takeoff of the celiac. At the time of presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**] she was not complaining of any abdominal pain and her
vascular exam was unchanged (palpable bilateral upper and lower
extremity pulses).

Pertinent Results:
[**2112-10-6**] PORTABLE CHEST
FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The
mediastinal contours are prominent.  The lungs are clear of
consolidation, although there is minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature as
well.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:  Mediastinal prominence may represent an unfolded
aorta, although correlation with subsequent torso CTA performed
on the same date is recommended; minimal pulmonary vascular
congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.

[**2112-10-6**] ct chest
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The thyroid gland is normal and
symmetric in appearance.  The trachea and central airways are
patent to the segmental level.

Extensive emphysema is seen throughout the upper lungs.
Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.

The esophagus is normal.  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or
hilar
lymphadenopathy.

A small amount of pericardial fluid in the superior recess is of
relative low attenuation but slightly above that of simple fluid
(20-25 [**Doctor Last Name **]). Coronary calcification is noted.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver is normal in
attenuation without focal lesion or intra- or extra-hepatic
biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder is surgically
absent.  The CBD is mildly prominent, compatible with
post-cholecystectomy state, measuring 11 mm, probably due to
prior cholecystectomy.  The pancreas, spleen, and right adrenal
gland are normal.

A 9 mm hypodensity in the left adrenal gland (2:99) is
indeterminate on this study but unchanged.  A 6 mm hypodense
focus in the interpolar region of the right kidney is too small
to characterize.  There is no hydronephrosis.

The stomach, small and large bowel appear unremarkable with the
exception of sigmoid diverticula without active inflammatory
changes.  A fat-containing ventral hernia is noted.  There is no
mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.  There is no free air
or free fluid in the abdomen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder is densely filled
with contrast.  From the prior study, the uterus and ovaries are
unremarkable.  The rectum is normal.  There is no pelvic or
inguinal adenopathy.  There is no free pelvic fluid.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion
concerning for osseous malignancy.  Minimal multilevel
degenerative changes are seen in the spine.

CTA:  Extensive high density thickening of the aortic wall
involving the
descending aorta, beginning at the level of the left subclavian
artery and
extending to the level just below the renal arteries is similar
or slightly progressed from the previous examination of [**9-30**] and
compatible with intramural hematoma.  A new frank type B
dissection flap across the lumen begins at the level of the left
pulmonary vein (2:47) and extends just to the level just beyond
the celiac artery.  The celiac artery appears to fill off the
false lumen, with the remainder of the intra-abdominal arteries
filling off the true lumen.  Minimal intramural hematoma
involves the proximal superior mesenteric artery.  Multiple
areas of intramural contrast extravasation and/or ulceration are
new along the upper descending aorta within the intramural
hematoma, but above formation of the flap (2:25, 2:39, 2:38 and
2:101).  There are ulcerating Atherosclerotic plaques and patchy
calcification along the lower
descending thoracic aorta.

Just beyond the origin of the left common carotid and left
subclavian there is focal irregularity (2:6 and 2:5), which are
likely related to plaque at a site of vessel tortuosity.

Axial measurements of the aortic lumen measure up to 35 x 31 mm
in axial
dimensions along the proximal descending aorta. Along the upper
ascending
aorta measurements up to 37 x 34 mm correspond to slight
ectasia.

An aortic aneurysm is seen (2:139) at the level of the inferior
mesenteric
artery takeoff, measuring 2.7 cm, distinct from the dissection
and consistent with an incidental finding.

BONES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Type B aortic dissection extending from the level of the
left pulmonary vein to just beyond the celiac artery with the
celiac artery filling off the false lumen.  Minimal fluid in the
superior pericardial recess is mildly hyperdense, so a
hemorrhagic component is possible although apparent measured
increase in attenuation may be technical in etiology.

2.  Distal infrarenal aortic aneurysm just above the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] takeoff
measuring 2.7 cm; attention in follow-up imaging is recommended
for surveillance.

3.  Indeterminate 9 mm hypodense left adrenal lesion, but most
likely benign, although not fully characterized.  Attention in
follow-up imaging surveillance is recommended; alternatively if
further characterization is desired at this time or before
follow-up imaging of the dissection, dedicated CT or MR protocol
could be considered.

4.  Diverticulosis without evidence of active inflammation.

5.  Coronary artery calcifications.

Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] in person at 2231 at the time of discovery on [**2112-10-6**].

[**2112-10-7**] CT HEAD
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass
effect, or infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and configuration.  The basal cisterns appear patent and
there is preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.

No fracture is identified.  The visualized paranasal sinuses,
mastoid air
cells and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes are
unremarkable.

CONCLUSION:  No evidence of hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or
acute
infarction.

[**2112-10-10**]:  CT CHEST/ ABD/ PELVIS :
FINDINGS:

CT CHEST:  The visualized portion of the thyroid is unremarkable
in
appearance. There are multiple subcentimeter nodules in
bilateral breasts.  The trachea is midline.  The airways are
patent to the subsegmental level.

There is severe centrilobular emphysema throughout the lungs
with apical
predilection.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.  There are no
effusions,
nodules or pneumothorax.

There is no supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy.

Pericardial fluid is again noted, but is slightly decreased in
amount from previous examination.  Coronary artery calcification
is noted.  The heart and great vessels are otherwise
unremarkable in appearance.

CT ABDOMEN:  The liver is homogeneous in appearance with no
focal lesions
without intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder
is surgically absent and the CBD is prominent measuring 1.2 cm
in diameter compatible with post-cholecystectomy.  The pancreas
and spleen are unremarkable in appearance. The right adrenal
gland is unremarkable in appearance.  There is a stable 9-mm
hypodensity in the left adrenal gland, likely representing
adenoma.  There is a stable 6-mm hypodensity in the interpolar
region of the right kidney that is too small to fully
characterize by CT examination, but likely representing a simple
cyst.  Otherwise, bilateral kidneys present symmetric uptake and
excretion of contrast without hydronephrosis, stones, worrisome
lesions or perinephric abnormalities.

The stomach, duodenum and small bowel are unremarkable in
appearance with no focal wall thickening or obstruction noted.
There are scattered diverticula throughout the large intestine,
predominantly located in the sigmoid colon.  There is no
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free
air or ascites within the abdomen.  There is a fat-containing
ventral hernia as well as a small umbilical hernia.

CT PELVIS:  The uterus and bilateral ovaries are unremarkable in
appearance.  There is a small amount of air within the bladder,
compatible with recent instrumentation.  There is no pelvic or
inguinal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free pelvic fluid.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Degenerative changes are noted throughout
the spine.  There are no focal lesions in the visualized osseous
structures concerning for malignancy.

CTA:  Again noted is extensive high-density thickening of the
aortic wall
beginning proximally at the level of the left subclavian artery
and extending to just inferior of the renal arteries as well as
dissection flap, beginning at the level of the left pulmonary
vein and extending just beyond the celiac artery.  The extent of
dissection is stable; however, there is increased amount of
hematoma within the false lumen at the level of the celiac
artery which is narrowing the false lumen and presenting mass
effect on the true lumen.  Despite the increased mass effect,
the celiac artery has preserved flow and is filling off of the
false lumen.  The SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent, receiving flow from
the true lumen.  There are multiple areas of descending aorta
ulceration as well as atherosclerotic plaques, which are stable
from previous examination.  Maximum dimensions of the aortic
lumen within the ascending aorta measures 4.0 x 3.7 cm and in
the descending aorta 3.5 x 3.5 cm, representing slight ectasia.
Again noted is a focal aortic aneurysm at
the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] measuring 2.7 cm.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Type B aortic dissection extending from the level of the
left pulmonary vein to just beyond the celiac artery with the
celiac artery filling from the false lumen.  Extent of
dissection is unchanged; however, there is increased amount of
clot in the false lumen, narrowing the false lumen, presenting
greater mass effect on the true lumen.  However, flow is
preserved.
2.  Distal infrarenal aortic aneurysm at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
3.  9 mm hypodense lesion in the left adrenal gland, most likely
representing an adenoma.  Attention on followup imaging is
recommended.
4.  Diverticulosis.
5.  Coronary artery calcifications as well as multiple
ulcerative
atherosclerotic plaques within the aorta.
6.  Fat-containing umbilical as well as ventral hernia.
7.  Small right interpolar renal hypodensity too small to fully
characterize by CT, but likely representing a simple cyst.
8.  Extensive emphysema.
9.  Small focus of air within the bladder that could represent
recent
instrumentation or infection.  Clinical correlation is
recommended.

 [**2112-10-11**] CT Chest abd pelvis
Final Report INDICATION:  57-year-old woman with known type B
dissection status post repair presents with epigastric pain,
evaluate for flow within the SMA and celiac.

COMPARISON:  CTA torso [**2112-10-10**].

TECHNIQUE:  Helical axial MDCT images were obtained from the
chest, abdomen and pelvis after the administration of IV
contrast in the arterial phase.  Multiplanar reformatted images
were obtained in the sagittal and coronal planes.

DOSE REPORT:  Total DLP [**2074**].98 mGy-cm.

FINDINGS:

CT OF THE CHEST:  The visualized portion of the thyroid is
unremarkable. The trachea is midline.  The airways are patent to
the subsegmental levels.  Severe emphysematic changes are noted
in bilateral lungs.  Bilateral pleural effusions are new since
most recent prior examination.  There is adjacent opacification
which most likely represents compressive atelectasis; however,
infectious process cannot be completely excluded.

There is atherosclerotic calcification involving the coronary
vessels.  There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes do not meet CT size
criteria for pathology.

The heart and great vessels are otherwise unremarkable in
appearance.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The liver is homogenous in appearance
without evidence of focal liver lesions.  There is no evidence
of intrahepatic biliary dilation.  The patient is status post
cholecystectomy.  The spleen, pancreas and right adrenal gland
are unremarkable. 9 mm left adrenal nodule is unchanged from the
prior examination.  Bilateral kidneys show no evidence of
hydronephrosis.

Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet CT size
criteria for pathology.  There is no free air or free fluid
within the abdomen.

CT OF THE PELVIS:  The bladder contains a Foley.  Air within the
bladder
likely represents instrumentation.  The uterus appears
unremarkable.  There is evidence of sigmoid and descending colon
diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

Bilateral pelvic side wall lymph nodes do not meet CT size
criteria for
pathology.  Small fat-containing ventral hernia is noted.

CTA:  Patient is status post repair of type B dissection with
EVAR stent graft extending from the level of the left subclavian
artery and to just inferior to the origin of the renal arteries.
 The dissection appears to extend into the celiac
trunk(301:104); it is difficult to say if this was present on
the prior study. Both sides of the dissection flap, however
appear perfused homogenously with patent celiac trunk.  The SMA
and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent.  Again noted are areas of aortic ulcerations
as well as atherosclerotic plaques stable from the prior
examination.  Maximum dimension of the aortic lumen within the
ascending aorta measures 2.8 x 3.6 cm and the 3.1 x 3.1 cm
within the descending aorta.  Again
noted is a focal aortic aneurysmal morphology at the level of
the [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
measuring 2.7 cm (3:140 and 602b:47).

3D reformations generated in the imaging lab of the aorta and
endovascular stent include 3D MIP and VR rotations, curved
reformatted images, and 3D measurements (below). These were
reviewed in the interpretation of this examination.

Measurements:
Aortic valve: 3.8 cm
Aortic cusps: 4.4 cm
Ascending aorta/[**MD Number(3) 26547**]: 4.0 cm
Ascending aorta/Proximal arch: 3.6 cm
Proximal descending thoracic aorta/Distal arch (stent lumen +
aorta wall): 2.8 cm Maximum, descending thoracic aorta (stent
lumen + aorta wall): 5.0 cm Abdominal aorta, celiac trunk (stent
lumen + aorta wall): 2.8 cm Abdominal aorta, SMA (stent lumen +
aorta wall): 2.8 cm

IMPRESSION:

1.  Status post repair of type B aortic dissection with EVAR
stent graft
extending from the level of the left subclavian artery to just
below the
origin of the renal arteries.
2.  Distal infrarenal aortic aneurysm at the level of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**],
unchanged.
3.  Dissection appears to extend into the celiac trunk. Both
sides of the
dissection flap demonstrate homogenous perfusion with patency of
celiac trunk SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
4. Unchanged 9 mm right adrenal nodule.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
atelectasis new from the prior exam.
6. Ventral fat containing hernia.

[**2112-10-13**] CXR
Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION:  Fever, evaluation for pneumothorax and line
position.

FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph from [**10-12**], [**2112**], the venous introduction sheath on the right has been
changed to a right internal jugular vein catheter.  The signs
indicative of bilateral parenchymal opacities at the lung bases,
most likely fluid overload, have decreased in severity.  The
size of the cardiac silhouette, including the aortic stent
graft, is unchanged.





Brief Hospital Course:
On [**10-6**] the pt presented to an OSH with abdominal pain where a
CT abdomen was done which showed an aortic dissection. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a confirmatory CTA.  She was
admitted to the ICU for blood pressure control and serial
abdominal exams.

At the time of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] she was not complaining of
any abdominal pain and her vascular exam was unchanged (palpable
bilateral upper and lower extremity pulses).  She was agitated
while in the ICU and received Ativan to which she became
delerious.  She was seen by psychiatry for acute delerium and
they asked to hold ativan and to use Hadol for any agitation.

She remained stable and the plan was to manage her medially.
She was transferred to the VICU.  On the morning of [**2112-10-10**] she
was complaining of upper abdominal pain and retro sternal pain.
Her VS were stable at that pt as was her EKG.  On exam she
looked slightly pale without diaphoresis.  Her distal pulses
were all palpable at that time. She was sent for stat CTA and
then sent to prep and hold where she was consented for TEVAR.
It was noted on the CT that she had extension of her dissection
with possible compressive thrombus.

She underwent the procedure without complication. She was
recovered in the VICU and did well.  Her diet and activity were
advanced. She was voiding freely and tolerating an oral diet.
She ambulated without assistance.  Her follow up appts were
scheduled.  She was councelled to follow up with her PCP within
two weeks.

DIAGNOSIS:



Liver, allograft, needle core biopsy:

Liver parenchyma with no significant portal or lobular
inflammation.



No fatty change or features of preservation/ischemic injury are
seen.



No features of acute cellular rejection are seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the operating room and underwent an
orthotopic liver transplant; the patient only required 1 unit of
packed cells, 2 units of
platelets, 500-cc of albumin, and 1 unit of cryo intraop. He was
taken to the APCU intubated and in stable condition. Patient did
extremely well and was therefore extubated later that day (ahead
of the pathway). He stayed in the ICU for monitoring for another
24hours, and was then transferred to the floor late on POD1.
From here he made a remarkabel recovery. He continued to make
good urine and LFTs went downward for the first few days. He
ambulated with assitance and tolerated good po pretty early.
Some hampering to his recovery was the fact that he is blind and
somewhat deaf - he was continually claiming to be depressed
because of boredom and lonliness. Duplex on POD1 was normal, and
CXRs continued to be normal. His CVL was removed before he left
the ICU. On POD5 his LFTs bumped up slightly, so he recieved 2
boluses of steroids as a precautionary measure and a repeat US
was performed which showed a mural thrombus in the donor IVC.
Biopsy was done which was normal and without signs of rejection.
After that, LFTs started to decline again and patient continued
to do extremely well.

History of Present Illness:
38yo man with type I DM, CKD (baseline Cr 2.2-2.6, systolic and
diastolic CHF with EF 50-55%, refractory HTN and gastroparesis
with recurrent admissions for gastroparesis presented to new
PCP's office with recurrent nausea, vomiting, inability to take
pos and chest pain radiating to his back and was sent to ED. He
was last admitted 2 weeks ago with similar sx other than chest
pain, and was admitted for PNA and C. Diff. He states that he
has had abdominal pain and nausea/ vomiting over last week
similar to previous bouts of gastroparesis. He denies missing
any insulin doses and says he has been taking 10U at night, 4U
in evening with sugars <200 almost always. He finished [**Last Name (un) 8692**]
flagyl course, and had not had any diarrhea other than 1 episode
this AM.

In ED, initial vitals were significant for BP 250/140 and
glucose of 700 and a anion gap of 18 when corrected for
hyperglycemia. Pt. had CT without contrast to assess for
dissection given chest pain radiating to his back which was
negative. No leukocytosis, CXR and U/A negative, blood cx.
pending. He was placed on insulin gtt and received 40mg
labetalol with improvement of his BPs and resolution of his
chest pain. Initially, was to be sent to ICU, however no beds
available. As his sugars improved with insulin gtt and his his
AG closed, he is now admitted to the floor after transitioning
off insulin gtt since 3AM. He received 6U NPH 2h prior to
transfer and was actually hypoglycemic necessitating D50 X 1.

His ROS is significant for lack of cough. + CP, but
non-exertional, with no radiation and associated with abdominal
pain. No shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, LE edema. No
fevers or chills, though currently feels cold.

.
ECG: NSR with ST elevations ~ 1mm in V1-V3 c/w early
repolarization changes in anterior leads, V1 similar to

Brief Hospital Course:
38yo type I diabetic with gastroparesis presents with chronic
sx. and DKA likely [**12-30**] medication nonadherence. Pt c/o chest
pain and found to have significant esophagitis. Then with acute
renal failure after cardiac catheterization to further
characterize chest pain (no significant CAD). Cr returned
towards baseline. Compliance with treatment plan and
appointments continues to be challenging and although patient
frustrated with his long hospital stay, he does not take active
role in his health care.

DKA: The patient originally presented with hyperglycemia.  No
evidence of ketones or acidosis.  He did have an anion gap with
closed quickly with IVFs and insulin gtt.  He was quickly
transitioned to SQ insulin.  There was no evidence of infection.
His blood sugars were difficult to control throughout his
hosptital stay in part because he was frequently NPO for
proceedures. He was followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consult
service. He was treated with NPH and a gentle SSI. Discharging
him with NPH and a sliding scale was discussed, but the patient
noted that he was legally blind and only able to read his
Innolet disc and would not be able to draw up syringes. He will
f/u with [**Last Name (un) **].
.
Hypoglycemia/Hypothermia: after receiving full insulin dose
while NPO and undergoing stress test, the patient experienced an
episode of hypoglycemia, confusion, diaphoresis, hypothermia to
91.9 and sinus bradycardia. He was transferred briefly to the
ICU for monitoring, but once his glucose was corrected, the
other issues also resolved shortly thereafter. He was
transferred back to the floor the following day.
.
N/V/abd pain:  This was thought secondary to his known
gastroparesis and was similar in nature to his prior episodes.
He was started on RTC antiemetics and pain control as needed. He
was transitioned from IV to PO dilauded. It was difficult to
assess his abd pain as it was both LUQ, epigastric and
substernal and radiated to the left shoulder. CT abd in the ED
showed a thickend esophagus. He was evaluated with an EGD which
showed severe esophagitis, gastritis and a soft food bezoar all
of which were though to be due to gastroparesis and reflux. His
antacid regimen was increased to PPI [**Hospital1 **]. He was also placed on
a liquid diet to facilitate the resolution of the bezoar and
improve his gastroparesis. H.pylori serology was negative.
Pathology showed...Per GI consult recomendation, erythmocyin was
stopped as PO erythromycin has no effect on gastroparesis and as
IV erythromycin has limited effect due to tachyphylaxis. In
addition, there was a concern for risk of prolonged QT when he
became bradycardic.
.
Chest Pain: In the ED, a CT was negative for dissection.  He was
ruled out by cardiac enzymes.  He was seen by cardiology on the
floor who felt that given his numerous risk factors he should
have a stress test.  Given his baseline abnormal EKG a stress
MIBI was performed, during which he had chest pain - although he
had CP prior,during and after the test as well.  At level of
exercise achieved (only 37% of age-predicted maximum), there
were no myocardial perfusion defects, however, depressed LVEF
(38%) and global hypokinesis. He then received a dobutamine
echo. The patient received intravenous dobutamine beginning at
15 mcg/kg/min. The blood pressure response to stress was
abnormal/mildly hypertensive. Resting images demonstrated
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the posterior wall. At low dose dobutamine [15mcg/kg/min;
heart rate 68 bpm, blood pressure 210/100 mmHg), there was
global hypokinesis and no reduction of cavity size; however,
there was also concerning LV ballooning and inducible ishemia.
Because of these results, he was thought to be high cardiac risk
and was kept in house for cardic catheterization. The
significiant risk of kidney failure and life-long dialysis was
discussed prior to cardiac catheterization. The patient decided
to undergo the risk with full informed consent. Cardiac
catheterization did not demonstrate significant coronary artery
disease. He was medically managed with ASA,BB,[**Last Name (un) **], statin and
his medication doses were adjusted as indicated. EGD
demonstrated signficiant esophagitis and this was thought to be
the cause of his chest pain. Given a h/o allergy to lidocaine,
he did not receive magic mouthwash and was started on
sucralfate. He will f/u with GI. His PPI was changed to
ranitidine [**12-30**] ?effect on his acute renal failure.
.
Anemia: He has a baseline anemia due to CKD. The patient
reported that just prior to moving his care to [**Location (un) 86**] that Epo
shots had been started where not currently being administered.
Two days after EGD his HCT dropped from 32 to 28 to 27. His HCT
remained stable at 28 and then rose again. He was guiac
negative, but it is most likely that he had some mild GI
bleeding. Because of the this HCT drop and because
anticoagulants are given during cardiac cath, cardiac cath was
defered until his HCT stabilized. Pt was then started on Procrit
and will receive weekly injections.
.
HTN: Uncontrolled while hospitalized, partly because not
tolerating all of his PO medications at the begining of his
hospital course.  His valsartan and BB were uptitrated to
achieve better control but valsartan was again decreased [**12-30**]
renal failure. His beta-blocker was limited by bradycardia in
the ICU and then HR 60-70 on the floor. Clonidine was started
and he will take this in patch form.
.
Acute on chronic renal failure: The creatinine remained at
baseline 2-2.4 throughout his hospital course but day after
catheterization and after having received adquate hydration,
sodium bicarbonate and mucomyst pt's creatinine jumped to peak
3.3.  IT weas thought to be secondary to contraste dye versus
his PPI has he had high eosinophilia. He was changed back to
ranitidine. He was seen by the renal consult team and will see
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] as outpatient.

Primary Diagnosis:
Type I DM
DKA
Mild GI bleeding due to gastritis
Hypertension
Gastroparesis
Esophagitis
Gastritis
Cardiomyopathy


Discharge Condition:
Stable; improved blood sugar, blood pressure, tolerating POs.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain which was thought to be secondary to your
gastroparesis, esophagitis and gastritis. You had biopsies taken
of your esophagus and stomach. It is important that you see a
gastroenterologist to follow up on these results.  We increased
your doses of anti-acid medication to treat the esophagitis and
gastritis. We gave you nausea medication and pain medication and
your symptoms improved but did not completely resolve. You
should eat small frequent meals with a low residual diet. It
will take some time for your nausea and pain to go away as the
gastritis resolves.
.
You also had chest pain while you were hospitalized.  Your blood
work and EKG's were normal but because you have risk factors for
heart disease a stress test was performed.  It showed that you
heart has a decreased ability to pump. Cardiac catheterization
was negative for significant disease.
.
You had acute kidney failure and were seen by the kidney
specialists. This was thought to be secondary to medication
effect (pantoprazole) and possibly the cardiac catheterization
dye.
.
Some medication changes were made to better control you blood
sugar, blood pressure and cardiac risk factors. You should stop
taking Erythromycin. Please follow the medications as directed.
.
Please have the VNA draw a lab to check your creatinine next
week. You do not need to go to the lab unless the VNA is unable
to draw them.
.
PLEASE MAKE ALL APPOINTMENTS SCHEDULED FOR YOU. You have many
medical appointments to follow but if you do not keep these
appointments you will likely end up back in the hospital.  Your
health is very important and is a full time job and we will help
you coordinate your care.
.
Please return to the ER for inability to keep food down, chest
pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or high blood sugars.
If you have blood in your stool or vomit, you should return to
the emergency room.

CXR [**2112-12-5**]
FINDINGS: Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.
Right CP angle
is excluded thus limiting evaluation. Evaluation is also limited
by
underpenetrated technique. The lungs appear clear bilaterally.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Osseous structures
appear intact.
Left AC joint hypertrophic changes are noted.
IMPRESSION: Limited study without evidence of acute process.
Right CP angle
exclusion limits evaluation.

CXR [**2112-12-8**]
There are relatively low inspiratory volumes on this
examination. Right-sided
IJ central venous catheter remains present, with the tip
difficult to
visualize but probably at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac
and
mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged. Allowing for low
inspiratory
volume, no gross pulmonary consolidation is seen. No evidence of

pneumothorax. Osseous structures remain unchanged and grossly
unremarkable
aside from mild degenerative changes at the right
acromioclavicular joint.
IMPRESSION: Low inspiratory volumes; no appreciable interval
change or
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.




Brief Hospital Course:
#. GIB: Hematemesis has been consistent with an upper GI source.
 Patient was transferred to the ICU from ED intubated for airway
protection and underwent emergent EGD, with clot in fundus that
was not unroofed, but no other sources of bleeding.  Patient
then underwent placement of a Right Internal Jugular central
line and received a total of 3 units of blood for a hematocrit
which nadered at 26. She was initially started on a protonix
drip which was changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing of 40 mg after her HCT was
stable.  She was extubated on ICU day 2 and remained somewhat
confused and disoriented.  This was thought to be related to the
Benzodiazepines administered for sedation.  She underwent a
second EGD by GI, which found flat lesions and an ulcer in the
cardia treated with epinepherine and gold probe.  She also had
some evidence of esophagitis.  On the third ICU day, patient
remained somewhat confused, but was otherwise hemodynamically
stable and was transferred to the floor.
   On the floor, crit continued to remain stable, ranging
between 25-27.3. Pt received one additional unit pRBC on the
floor. Pt continued to remain hemodynamically stable, and was
resumed on her home HCTZ. Pt did not have any additional
episodes of melena or hemetemesis. Mental status and lethargy
cleared up and patient as alert and oriented on day of
discharge. She was continued on a high dose PPI (40mg PO bid),
and will be following up as outpt with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was removed
prior to discharge (had been maintained on the floor as pt had
poor peripheral access.) PT was consulted, and initially felt
that pt would benefit from continued PT, but upon re-eval, pt
was doing much better and will be able to go home without PT.
H.pylori is pending and will need to be followed up as
outpatient.
.
# HIV: Pt is on anti-retroviral therapy. Her last CD4 count was
488 and VL <48 as of [**7-8**]. She was continued on her HAART during
her stay (Lamivudine, Abacavir, Tenofovir, Ritonovir,
Fosamprenivir.) CD4/VL was re-checked per pt request and results
are pending, so will need to be followed up as outpt. Pt will
need to follow-up for further HIV management with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 11528**] (appt scheduled.)
.
# HTN: Pt is on HCTZ at home. This was held on admission given
bleed. This was resumed at discharge as pt was hemodynamically
stable (systolic BPs stable in 100-130s)with no further obvious
signs of bleed on day of discharge.
.
# FEN: regular heart healthy diet. Pt was cleared by speech and
swallow evaluation for advancing as tolerated s/p extubation,
and pt was tolerating regular solids on day of discharge.
.
# PPX: Pneumoboots, PO PPI [**Hospital1 **]

rheumatic heart disease with moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], PAF (on
coumadin), hypertension who has a history of vague chest pain.
She was admitted to [**Location (un) **] back in [**Month (only) 359**] and ruled out.
Stress on [**2150-11-9**] exercised for 4 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol
to a heart rate of 98.  She experienced no chest pain and had no
significant ST-T wave changes.  Nuclear images did show a
posterolateral reversible defect in addition to a small anterior
apical defect. She was seen last week by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] in the office
for evaluation of near syncope and given an event monitor. Today
she went to the [**Location (un) **] ER due to increasing chest pain over the
past week with associated weakness. No significant findings on
event monitor per [**Doctor Last Name 11493**]. Per patient, she has had symptoms of
left shoulder pain radiating down her left arm and up left jaw
for many years and all previous work-up has been negative.
However, in past month, she has developed a new type of chest
discomfort over entire chest and associated with nausea and
feeling fatigued and lightheaded. No palps, no SOB, no LOC, no
association with any activity. She has 4 episodes a day lasting
about 5 minutes. Nothing make it better or worse and they occur
irregardless of activity.
.
Upon arrival to [**Location (un) **] ER, INR 3.3. EKG without acute findings
of ischemia. She received SLNTG X3 with no effect. Nitro gtt
started and CP free after 30 min. Then, 45 min later developed
hypotension to 84/36, pt asymptomatic -> nitro gtt stopped, 500
of NS, then 1L NS bolus. SBP in mid80's and she was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On route to [**Hospital1 18**], SBP dropped again->500 cc NS given. SBP
dropped to 47/26 -> started dopamine 20 mcg in ambulance. BP
rose to 110-130s within 5 minutes. NO chest pain, palps, SOB
during this, but did feel more fatigued.
.
In CCU, afebrile, 111/64, 62, 100%2LNC. She reports feeling
fatigued, but no other symptoms of CP, palp, SOB, LHD,
dizzyness. At baseline, she can climb 2 flights of stairs and
now feels slightly more fatigued than usual.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 73 y/o F hx PAF on coumadin, HTN, bradycardia and
first degree AVB now presents with chest pressure and
lightheadedness

CAD: Patient has no known diagnosis of CAD, and cardiac cath
from [**2148**] from [**Hospital3 2568**] had clean coronary arteries.  She ruled
out for an MI here and had a stress stress P - MIBI which
revealed no perfusion defects and an LVEF of 65%. Recent stress
test per OSH cardiologist notes echo done last week per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] no valve abnormalites. Prior report of MS/MR incorrect.
She has been having these symptoms for the past month and her
cardiologist felt that there may be a component of near syncope
[**3-13**] bradycardia as opposed to CAD. However, her symptoms were
relieved with nitro. NO EKG changes. [**Hospital3 **] cath report from
[**2148**] show clean coronary arteries.  Given negative stress,
recent cath that was negative, reportedly normal echo a decision
was made not to cath the patient.  Beta blocker, aspirin, statin
were continued.  Her coumadin was held as an inpatient as she
was supratherapeutic, this drifted down to INR 1.5 upon
discharge, she was discharged with a lovenox bridge.  A1C 6.1%.
LDL 70, HDL 40, Total 131, Trig 107.

Chest Pain: 2 weeks at most 30 min at a time, no assoc w/
exerction, not reproduced w/ palpation dull in nature, several
times per day. Supratherapeutic on couadmin and not pleurtic
making PE less likely, no tenderness on exam so costochondritis
is less likely, cannot rule out coronary vasospasm.  Patient
should also have a workup for GERD as an outpatient.

Rhythm: Hx of paroxsysmal afib,  continue anticoagulation and
propafenone.  INR 1.4 on discharge, discharged with lovenox
bridge with close follow up with her primary cardiologist.

Hypotension: patient was hypotensive in the setting of nitro
gtt, transiently on a dopamine drip for a SBP in the 40s
although the patient was mentating at the time and there is a
question as to whether the pressure was actually as low as
recorded.  Hypotension did not return and the patient was
normotensive with the addition of her home antihypertensive

OSH with altered mental status.
.
Her father found her on the morning of admission with her legs
hanging over the side of the bed.  She was unresponsive.  The
family reports that she had been feeling well at home but
becoming increasingly confused.  They admit that she often
fights against taking lactulose, though they feel she is largely
compliant with it.  She may have spit out her lactulose dose
last night.  Otherwise, ROS significant for some nausea.  She
has nevertheless been eating and drinking well.  No diarrhea.
No fevers.

Upon arrival to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital3 6783**], her VS were 129/60   117   21
98% RA.  She was intubated because of failure to protect her
airway.  Although the lowest recorded temp was 96.2 rectally,
she was noted as being hypothermic and a bair hugger was placed.
 Labs were notable for K of 6.2 and non-gap acidosis with HCO3
of 14.  Lactate was elevated at 5.6.  WBC elevated at 16 with
Hct and Cr at baseline.  UA significant for large leukocytes and
negative nitrites.  CT Head without contrast revealed vague area
of low attenuation in the lft frontal region, ? related to small

process
.
[**2185-11-16**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] and Brain without contrast:  Limited study due
to motion artifact. No contrast was administered due to the
patient's inability to further cooperate and the marginal renal
status. There is no evidence of infarction. The MRA demonstrates
a dominant and patent right vertebral artery with a tiny, but
apparently patent left vertebral artery, and patent internal
carotid arteries bilaterally. The remainder of the study,
although limited, demonstrates no evidence of hemorrhage or
other abnormalities.
.
[**2185-11-17**] CT abd and pelvis w/o contrast: 1. No evidence of
hemoperitoneum or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Cirrhotic liver, with signs for portal hypertension with a
large amount of ascites.
3. Consolidation within the lower lobes of the lungs
bilaterally, most likely represents atelectasis. However,
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.

5. Anasarca.
.
[**2185-11-22**] Liver, gallbladder u/s: 1. Patent TIPS with abnormally
high velocities within the mid and distal aspects of the shunt,
similar to the previous exam. Findings remain compatible with
TIPS malfunction.
2. Limited evaluation of the left and anterior right portal vein
although
suggestion of abnormal directionality of flow within the left
portal vein
is compatible with shunt dysfunction.
3. Cirrhotic liver with moderate-to-severe perihepatic ascites
and
cholelithiasis.
.
[**2185-11-24**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen
on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2185-10-27**], no major change is evident.

IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 59yo woman who presented w/ altered mental
status in the setting of Hep C cirrhosis.

# Altered Mental Status: Given her hx of hep C cirrhosis and
recent TIPs procedure, her AMS was thought to be most likely due
to hepatic encephalopathyy. She was reported to have a hx of
poor compliance with lactulose at home.  Of note, she has not
had other episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.
Head CT at OSH was negative.  Given her leukocytosis on
admission, infection, particularly SBP or pneumonia, were also
considered. Overdose was also a possibility, although family
denies drug use. Upon arrival in the MICU she was started on
lactulose and rifaximine. She underwent a paracentesis to eval
for SBP, which had a negative gram stain and culture. Given her
AMS, she was considered high risk for aspiration, and she was
started on empiric treatment with vanc/aztreonam/azithromycin
(allergic to cipro and keflex) for nosocomial or aspiration PNA
vs SBP. While there was no known hx of EtOH abuse, thiamine IV
was administered. On exam the pt had some focal findings of
persistent right-[**Hospital1 **] and downward deviation of her eyes, with
inability to track past midline. She had a repeat head CT and an
MRI/MRA which were both without evidence of significant
pathology. Following extubation and decreased sedation, her
mental status improved and the focal eye findings resolved.
While not back at her baseline, pt was awake, alert, and
oriented x3 when she was transferred to the floor. Pt seen by
Neurology, but had already had significant improvement and no
focal findings. On the floor, her mental status continued to
improve. At time of discharge, she is back to baseline,
conversational, oriented x3 but at times is tearful. She is
being discharged on Rifaximin and furosemide.
.
# Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for airway
protection at OSH.  Her CXR here suggested a possible aspiration
pneumonia, which could have been [**3-12**] to her AMS.  It is unclear
if she received IVF at OSH. She was weaned off of the vent
quickly as she required minimal pressure support and had good
RSBIs. She was extubated on [**2185-11-17**] was satting well on room air
at the time of transfer to the floor. On discharge, she
continues to have oxygen saturations in the high 90's on room
air.
.
# Rash: Pt arrived in the MICU with three skin findings. Bullae,
blisters/breakdown, and a  diffuse maculopapular rash on
proximal legs and trunk. Dermatology was consulted. The blisters
and bullae were thought to be [**3-12**] trauma in the setting of
coagulopathy due to liver disease and thinned skin. Urine
Porphobilinogens were checked to rule out porphyria in the
setting of Hep C liver disease and were negative. The diffuse
maculopapular rash appeared to be new, and looks more like a
hypersensitivity reaction, likely to ertapenem. Pt has known
allergies to Keflex ad Cipro, and had received ertapenem at the
OSH. She was treated with topical clobetasol cream to the rash
on abdomen and lower extremities (avoiding folds), and
hydrocortisone 2.5% cream to rash in folds of abdomen and groin.
Also, the bullae over time evolved into ulcerations on the pt's
legs, arms and left shoulder which were treated with wound care
as recommended by our wound care team and plastics.
.
# Cirrhosis [**3-12**] Hep C: Pt was treated as described above with
lactulose and rifaximine as well as a PPI, and was followed by
Hepatology.  She had a RUQ ultrasound on [**11-16**] and again on [**11-23**]
which showed her TIPS was patent. She should have a repeats TIPS
ultrasound in 1 month. She had a 5L paracentesis on [**11-20**] which
was negative for increased WBC and culture was sterile.
.
# VRE: Pt had blood culture [**11-16**] which grew VRE sensitive to
daptomycin and linezolid in [**2-11**] bottles. Daptomycin was started
on [**11-17**].  ID was consulted in house. TTE showed no vegetations
on [**11-24**].  The pt should be continued on IV daptomycin to
complete a 14 day course on [**2185-12-2**].
.
# Sinus tachycardia: Pt was likely intravascularly dry on
admission given Hct above baseline, poor urine output, and
tachycardia above baseline, although some level of tachyardia
appears to be chronic in her.  Also may be exacerbated by acute
illness. She received albumin 25g in 500cc NS x2 and her HR and
urine output were followed. Her diuretics were held until the
next morning. At discharge, her HR remains in the 80's to 90's.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Appeared hypovolemic
admission, her diuretics were held as above. Her diuretics were
gradually restarted on the floor. She is not accumulating
ascited at the time of discharge.
.
# Chronic Kidney Disease:  baseline Cr 1.8-2.0, Cr on discharge
1.5, urine output initially poor on admission, but improved
after fluid challenge.
.
# Thyroid nodule: Should be followed up as outpatient.
.
# Hyponatremia: Pt has chronic hyponatremia seen on past
admission with baseline 128-130. As diuretics were increased,
her sodium gradually decreased to 129 on day of discharge.
Treatment ongoing for this condition should include ongoing
fluid restriction to approximately 1500cc/day.
.
# Hypercalcemia: Pt had transient hypercalcemia to 10.8 this
admission thought to be [**3-12**] Calcium and vitamin D use at home.
These were stopped and Ca is now 9.9 at time of discharge.
Recommend not restarting these medications at this time.
.
# [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt with thrombocytopenia this admission
thought [**3-12**] chronic liver disease. Plt at discharge are 164.

Traumatic Skin Rash
Hyponatremia

Secondary:
Hepatitis C Cirrhosis
Chronic Kidney Disease


Discharge Condition:
Afebrile, stable, ambulatory.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after you were found passed out at home. This
was likely due to encephalopathy which cleared with lactulose,
and an infection that was found in your blood. You will continue
on an antibiotic, Daptomycin, intravenously for a total of 14
days, finishing on [**12-2**]. Please be sure to renally dose
this medication: once daily if GFR>50 or once every other day if

.
Continuing issues include hyponatremia, which should be managed
initially with fluid restriction. She has had chronic
hyponatremia with baseline 128-130 on previous admission here.
Please monitor sodium levels while at [**Hospital1 **].
.
Her course has also been complicated by easy bruising and
blistering which has necessitated a dermatology consult. It was
felt these were traumatically induced. They are being cared for
currently with wound care.
.
Of note, the patient was hypercalcemic, and found to have
elevated PTH level. She had been taking ergocalciferol and
cholecalciferol both of which were stopped, and the calcium
normalized. Please continue to hold these medications, to be
restarted at the discretion of her primary care physician and

surgery and if it cannot be explained by the surgery, further
evaluation with CT can be performed to assess for perforation.
2.  Sclerotic right seventh lateral rib lesion concerning for
metastasis is best evaluated on the PET-CT examination.
.
[**2108-8-9**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged bilateral retropharyngeal and masticator space
lesions, with cystic/necrotic changes on the right side,
previously demonstrated by neck CT on [**2108-7-19**], likely
related with a history of hypopharyngeal cancer.
2.  Intracranially there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement
to suggest metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.

[**2108-8-26**] CXR: COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**8-20**] and [**8-21**], [**2108**]. There is gradual progression of multifocal
consolidations, currently extensively involving left lower lobe,
left upper lobe and right lower lobe.  In addition, there is
interval development of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
.
[**2108-8-28**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:
1.  No definite acute intracranial process.
2.  No major vascular territorial infarct.  If clinical
suspicion is high, MRI could be considered.
3.  Left basal ganglia lacunes, age-related involution and mild
small vessel ischemic disease.
4.  Re-demonstration of cystic mass in the right retropharynx.
5.  Longstanding left maxillary sinus disease with atelectatic
appearance of the sinus and bony sclerosis.
.
[**2108-8-28**] MRI/MRA BRAIN: IMPRESSION:
1.  Multiple small acute infarcts in bilateral cerebral
hemispheres, right pons, and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres,
suggesting a central embolic source.  This was discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neurology between 4:30 and 4:45 pm on [**2108-8-28**].
2.  No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
3.  Partially visualized bilateral retropharyngeal and right
masticator space masses, related to the patient's known

[**2108-8-29**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: LIMITED VIEWS. Suboptimal image
quality. Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Cannot assess right ventricular function, aortic valve
structure/function, or tricuspid valve structure/function.
.
[**2108-9-2**] CXR: IMPRESSION: There are bilateral layering pleural
effusions and residual patchy airspace opacity in the left upper
lobe, left middle lung and at both bases.  These findings may
reflect pneumonia.  There is likely a superimposed component of
mild interstitial edema as well.  Right Port-A-Cath is unchanged
in position.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and
mediastinal contours are likely stable, although the left heart
border is somewhat obscured by the overlying effusion.
.
[**2108-9-3**] ECHO: No thrombus/mass.  Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2108-8-29**], a PFO is now detected.
.
[**2108-9-3**] LE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. Non-occlusive deep venous thrombosis within a short segment
of the right peroneal vein.
2. No deep venous thrombosis within the left lower extremity.

[**2108-9-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  No change from 9:54 a.m. in
pneumomediastinum and bibasilar opacities.
.
[**2108-9-15**] RUE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION:  No right upper extremity
deep venous thrombosis.
.
[**2108-9-20**] CTA NECK IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post tracheostomy placement with tip terminating
within the intrathoracic proximal trachea.  Thickening of the
pretracheal soft tissues at the level of the tracheostomy entry
likely post-surgical in nature. No evidence of erosions into
adjacent vessels by the tumor or active bleeding. interval
decreased size of level 5 abnormal lymph node and right
parapharyngeal cystic mass.
2.  Hypopharyngeal mass as described, smaller since the prior
examination.
3.  Blurring of the fat planes of the anterior neck as it could
be seen with radiation.
4.  Enlarged lymph nodes in the AP window and pretracheal
spaces.
5.  Worsening pleural effusions and parenchymal opacities that
could be seen with volume overload. .
.
[**2108-9-27**] pCXR FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is an unchanged right basilar opacity.  The extent and
severity of the parenchymal opacity is similar to the previous
examination.  Tracheostomy and right-sided Port-A-Cath are
unchanged.  Unchanged mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  No
pneumothorax.
.
[**2108-9-25**] CXR FINDINGS:Analysis is performed in direct comparison
with the next preceding similar study of [**2108-9-10**].  The
tracheal cannula is in midline position, seen to terminate in
the trachea.  Termination point is similar as it was before.
The on previous examination identified paratracheal air and
subcutaneous air in the left lower neck region, indicative of
pneumomediastinum at that time, cannot be seen anymore.  No
pneumothoraces present.  Heart size unchanged.  The previously
existing pulmonary congestive pattern and bilateral basal
parenchymal infiltrates have regressed markedly.  No new
abnormalities are seen.  A remaining diffuse haze on the left
base is indicative for some pleural effusion layering
posteriorly. IMPRESSION:  Stable position of tracheostomy
cannula, previously identified pneumomediastinum has
disappeared.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**2108-10-2**] pCXR: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change.  Tracheostomy tube in constant
position, right pectoral Port-A-Cath.  Constant elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm with minimal blunting of the costophrenic
sinuses.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No newly
appeared parenchymal opacities.  No pulmonary edema.
.
[**2108-10-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Tracheostomy tube is in standard
position.  Right subclavian infusion port ends in the mid to low
SVC.  No mediastinal widening or pneumothorax.  Lungs are
essentially clear.  Small right pleural effusion unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
72yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, DM, recently diagnosed
hypopharyngeal SCC admitted [**2108-8-7**] to ENT service for biopsy of
pharyngeal mass, G-tube and port placement.  Then transferred to
the oncology service on [**8-8**] for initiation of chemotherapy.  His
hospital course was significant for initiation of tube feeds
after failing a swallow evaluation.  Chemotherapy with
docetaxel, cisplatin, 5FU was initiated [**2108-8-11**], complicated by
diarrhea, severe cytopenias, ? leaking G tube, severe
nausea/vomiting.  On [**2108-8-19**], he received 10mg olanzapine for
nausea and subsequently became very lethargic and developed
fever, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and ultimately
transfered to the ICU [**2108-8-20**] for sepsis and neutropenic fever.
His ICU course was significant for diagnosis of LLL pneumonia,
hypotension attributed to hypovolemia [**3-8**] limited PO
intake/diarrhea vs. sepsis, improvement in acute renal failure,
hypernatremia.  He has had frequent atrial ectopy and PVCs and
electrolyte abnormalities.  ENT planned for tracheostomy [**2108-8-28**]
for airway protection during therapy, but on [**2108-8-28**] early AM,
he was found to have left facial droop.  MRI confirmed CVA
suggestive of thromboembolism.  TTE showed no evidence of clot.
Neuro recommended starting heparin ggt, which was started
[**2108-8-29**].  TEE could not be done given size/location of
hypopharyngeal mass.  Repeat TTE with bubble study revealed a
PFO and LE doppler U/S showed a RLE DVT.  The tracheostomy was
eventually placed [**2108-9-10**].  However, this was complicated by
bleeding over one week.  Anticoagulation was stopped as a
result.  A rechallenge with anticoagulation failed a second time
due to bleeding from his tumor and trach site.  He has
subsequently been managed with venodynes and prophylactic
heparin 5,000 units SC TID.  On [**2108-9-24**] he coughed out his
tracheostomy cannula.  Replacement was complicated by bleeding
and hemoptysis requiring ENT evaluation.  Bleeding/hemoptysis
resolved gradually over next 4 days.  He again developed
aspiration pneumonia [**2108-9-28**] and was started on cefepime and
vancomycin.  His respiratory status was stable and actually
improved rather quickly.  Antibiotics were stopped [**2108-10-3**].
Combination XRT and cetuximab was planned.  A loading dose
(400mg/m2) of cetuximab was given [**2108-10-3**] and radiation started
[**2108-10-10**] and will continue for 6 weeks total.
.
MICU COURSE:
Mr. O' [**Known lastname **] was admitted to MICU For airway monitoring after
trach placement.  Trach placement was uncomplicated.  On
admission, he was breathing comfortably and in no distress.
Post-op CXR was performed, which showed pneumomediastinum; this
was not unexpected given recent open procedure.  Repeat CXR
showed no change in pneumomediastinum.  Post-op trach care was
administered including airway suctioning as needed.  Tube feeds
were re-initiated with additional boluses of free water given
hypernatremia.  Enoxaparin was held overnight on day 1 of MICU
course because of bleeding from suction.  However, bleeding was
limited, so enoxaparin was restarted in the morning of MICU day
2.  Ophthalmology was consulted for continuing care of VZV; they
recommended continuing acyclovir.  He remained hemodynamically
stable and returned to the primary team.
.
OTHER DETAILS:
# Cough: CXR negative.  Cough may be due to XRT.  Continued
suction and humidified air via trach.
.
# Recurrent aspiration pneumonia/sepsis: Resolved.  Episode
[**2108-8-20**] required transfer to ICU with relative hypotension,
tachycardia, fever, hypoxia, and tachypnea.  LLL pneumonia on
CXR treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime, and
metronidazole due to concern for aspiration.  CXR [**2108-8-21**] and
[**2108-8-26**] showed worsening infiltrate, so abx changed to meropenem
with vancomycin [**2108-8-26**], finished [**2108-9-3**]. Concern for another
episode of PNA prompted use of vanco and cefepime [**2108-9-28**] -
[**2108-10-3**].  Continued to have secretions and rhonchi.  Guaifenesin
PRN cough.  Aspiration precautions.  AVOID sedating meds.
.
# Eye pain: Due to post-herpetic neuralgia +/- stye.
Ophthalmology consulted.  Started on lubrigel to maintain
hydration to eye surface.  Tramadol and acetaminophen PRN.
.
# Left eye lens implant (for ?glaucoma): Outpatient
bacitracin/polymyxin B used initially; stopped per
Ophthalmology.
.
# Zoster: VZV culture positive.  Started on acyclovir treatment
dose x10d, then changed to prophylaxis dose.  Ophthalmology
consulted; no ocular involvement initially, then filamentary
keratopathy seen [**2108-10-4**].  Pain initially controlled with
gabapentin, titrated off [**2108-9-15**] to avoid somnolence.  Restarted
gabapentin given increased pain; will titrate up dose.
Acetaminophen and tramadol PRN.
.
# S/P trach [**2108-9-10**]: Complicated by bleeding, resolved off
anticoagulation, now on heparin SC.  Cuff deflated [**2108-9-14**].
Routine trach change to uncuffed trach [**2108-9-17**].  CTA [**2108-9-20**]
showed soft-tissue swelling around the trach, but no active
bleed.  Coughed out trach tube [**2108-9-24**], re-bled then, now
resolved.  Airway suctioning PRN.  Continued telemetry for
continuous O2 monitoring (hospital policy for trach patients).
.
# Hemoptysis: As above.  ENT consulted.  No bleeding from tumor,
likely source is mild trauma from trach replacement.  Resolved.
- Change trach tube as needed or recommended by ENT/resp care
team.
.
# Hypopharyngeal squamous cell CA: T1N2bMx stage [**Doctor First Name **].  Started
cycle #1 TCF chemo [**2108-8-11**] complicated by N/V, severe cytopenias,
sepsis, and CVA.  Per ENT, the mass initially was filling the
hypopharynx and likely affecting his ability to handle
secretions though the airway was open.  Trach postponed due to
acute CVA, initially planned for [**2108-8-28**].  Per ENT (via
laryngoscopy), excellent response to chemotherapy with a ~90%
reduction in tumor size.  Unable to continue with TCF given
life-threatening complications, his treatment was changed to XRT
with concurrent cetuximab as a radio-sensitizer.  Loading dose
cetuximab 400mg/m2 given [**2108-10-3**].  2nd weekly dose delayed due
to insurance issues; given 250mg/m2 [**2108-10-12**].  Anti-emetics PRN.
Caphasol, Maalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine PRN mouth pain.
Continue daily XRT with weekly cetuximab for six weeks total.
.
# CVA/PFO: Left face drooping seen [**2108-8-28**]; MRI positive for
CVA, likely embolic.  Neurology consulted and heparin gtt
started.  Aspirin started [**2108-8-28**], but stopped when heparin
started.  MRA brain unremarkable.  TTE negative for clot.  No
TEE given location of tumor.  Repeat TTE with bubble study
showed a PFO.  LE doppler U/S showed a RLE DVT, possible  source
of CVA and [**Last Name (un) **] (paradoxical emboli).  Heparin gtt changed to
enoxaparin.  Then stopped for post-trach bleeding complications.
 Restarted heparin gtt [**2108-9-19**] and stopped [**2108-9-20**] due to
recurrent trach bleed.  Continue heparin 5000U SC TID.  PT/OT.
.
# RLE DVT: Anticoagulation stopped due to trach bleeding.  IVC
filter considered, but decided against.  Continued heparin SC
PPx and venodynes.
.

# Hypertension: Decreased amlodipine 10 to 5mg daily [**2108-8-30**] and
discontinued [**2108-9-13**] to change to metoprolol given ectopy.
Metoprolol dose increased from 12.5 to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  Added back
amlodipine 5mg daily [**2108-9-20**].  Trigger for hypertensive urgency
[**2108-9-21**], so amlodipine increased to 10mg daily.  Started
lisinopril 5 mg daily [**2108-9-30**] for SBPs in 160s for several days.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a biopsy of a tumor in
your throat (hypopharynx).  A G-tube for tube feeding and a port
for chemotherapy were placed.  The tumor biopsy confirmed
squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) and you were transferred to the
Oncology floor to start chemotherapy.  MRI of the brain did not
show any cancer in the brain.  Video swallow evaluation showed
severe aspiration of food and liquids.  You cannot eat or drink
until this is re-evaluated.  All of your nutrition must come
through tube feeds.  Tube feeds were started and you developed
high blood sugars managed with insulin.
.
Chemotherapy was difficult to tolerate.  You needed several
different types of anti-nausea medications.  All of your blood
counts became very low from the chemotherapy.  You developed
fevers and pneumonia that were treated in the Intensive Care
Unit with IV antibiotics.  You also developed a stroke with
left-sided weakness.  The stroke likely originated from a blood
clot in the right leg that traveled in the blood stream and
passed through a hole in the heart (patent foramen ovale) and
then into the brain and kidney also causing some kidney damage.
You were started on a blood thinner for this.  To prevent
difficulty breathing from future radiation therapy, a
tracheostomy was placed.  However, this was complicated by
bleeding and the blood thinner was not able to be restarted.
You also developed a rash on your left forehead.  Culture
confirmed this was shingles.  You were treated with an
anti-viral drug acyclovir and a pain medicine gabapentin for it.
.
You developed recurrent pneumonia and were started on IV
antibiotics.  You coughed out your trach tube, but this was
replaced.  You started daily radiation treatment [**10-10**],
Monday through Friday for 6 weeks.  You will also be treated
with weekly cetuximab immunotherapy during your radiation.  Your
first dose was on [**2108-10-3**].  As radiation therapy continues, your
cough may worsen and require more suctioning.

TRANSITION ISSUES:
1. You will return to [**Hospital1 18**] for daily radiation therapy, Monday
to Friday, for 6 weeks.
2. You will receive weekly cetuximab infusion therapy weekly
until radiation therapy is completed.
3. You will be going to a rehab center for physical therapy.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 63-year-old woman with a history of recurrent
Burkitt's lymphoma D +15 of [**Hospital1 **], who was recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] after her first treatment for recurrence (see PMH).
She had been doing well at home until the morning of [**2134-10-9**].
She had awoken early to come to her outpatient appointment at 7
[**Hospital 1826**] clinic, and on standing from bed, felt very
lightheaded. She does not recall much after that point. Her son
found her in the kitchen, lying against the cabinets in a pool
of feces. They called 911, and on transport to [**Hospital3 **], her BP was found to be 58/38. She was given IVF on
transport and in the ED at [**Hospital3 **].
.
She was afebrile, and her blood pressure responded to fluid
resuscitation to 90s/40s on transfer. She has been mentating the
entire time. At the OSH a chest X-Ray and Head CT were done.
Both of which were negative for any acute process. She was given
a dose of vancomycin and cefepime at the outside hospital out of
concern for infection given her neutropenia (WBC 0.2 at the OSH)
and hypotension.
.
On arrival to the floor, her vitals were T 99.4, BP 105/50, HR
99, RR 18 and O2 sat 100% on RA. She is mentating well and is
currently asymptomatic. She denies any fever or chills, cough,
chest pain, shortness of breath, dysuria, frequency, urgency,
myalgias, or abdominal pain. She admits to diarrhea this am,
lightheadedness, feeling ""dry,"" and pain in her mouth.


Past Medical History:
Interval History:
Burkitt's Lymphoma: She was admitted [**2134-9-20**] with 6 weeks of
persistent, progressive shoulder pain. On admission, there was a

palpable mass on her right chest wall and axilla. A CT scan
showed a large axillary mass that was cocerning for recurrence
of disease. She had an IR guided biopsy [**9-22**] which was
inconclusive, and was then taken to the OR for surgical
excisional biopsy [**9-23**] that showed recurrence of disease. On
[**2134-9-25**] she had an echocardiogram and began treatment with
[**Hospital1 **]. She had an LP done on [**10-1**], which was positive for
disease. At that time she recieved intrathecal methotrexate and
hydrocort. On [**2134-10-5**] her LP was repeated and she recieved
intrathecal cytarabine.  She was discharged with neupogen for
one week with close follow-up.

Studies:
[**10-10**] CT ABD/PELVIS- 1. No infectious source identified in the
chest, abdomen or pelvis. 2. Interval decrease in size of
confluent right axillary adenopathy compared to [**2134-9-21**]. 3. Single stable left paraaortic lymph node. 4. Sigmoid
diverticulosis, without diverticulitis. 5. Distention of the
stomach, without evidence for mechanical obstruction.  Correlate
clinically.

[**11-6**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology.
2. Similar appearance of 1-cm ground-glass nodular opacity in
the right upper lobe. Recommend continued followup.
3. Sub-4mm pulmonary nodules, with questionable interval
increase in size,
could be re-evaluated when followup for the ground-glass
opacity.
4. Slightly interval decrease in size of the right axillary
lymph node
conglomerate.

[**11-8**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild global hypokinesis. Mild mitral
regurgitation. No evidence of endocarditis seen. If clinically
suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography
does not exclude endocarditis. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2134-10-29**], the findings are similar.
Abnormal septal motion was seen on the prior study also.

[**11-14**] MRI shoulder: The lymphomatous mass in the right axilla,
encasing the right brachial plexus has increased in size
compared to prior imaging.

[**11-17**] U/S: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.

[**11-18**] CT torso: read pending at time of discharge, will be
followed up at outpatient appt on Monday [**11-22**]


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 63-year-old woman with
recurrent Burkitt's lymphoma who is D+15 of [**Hospital1 **] admitted from
an OSH with hypotension and neutropenia after a syncopal episode
at home.
.
# Hypotension/Syncope: She was found to be hypotensive to 58/38
by EMS, which responded to fluids. She was fluid resuscitated to
SBP of 70s by EMS and SBP of 90's by OSH ED prior to transfer.
Blood cultures were drawn and she was given cefepime and vanco
and transferred to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]. On arrival she was given 2L of
fluid, 1 unit of blood, and cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl.
Her pressures responded. OSH cultures came back as VRE 1:4
bottles, sensitive to ampicillin, daptomycin, levofloxacin, and
linezolid. She was switched to ampicillin on [**10-12**] and her PICC
was pulled. She was switched to daptomycin on Monday [**2134-10-18**]
because she had begun receiving hyper CVAD part B and amp
interferes with clearance of methotrexate.  She had a TTE and
TEE which showed no vegetations. As she was being treated for
the bacteremia, Ms. [**Known lastname 52**] again became hypotensive and
febrile, requiring transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she required
pressors. Blood cultures were sent and ultimately returned
positive with pseudomonas, believed to be associated with her
central line. Her line was pulled and her broad spectrum
antibiotic coverage (started given her sepsis in the setting of
neutropenia) was narrowed to cefepime, gentamicin, and
linezolid. Gentamicin was d/c-ed a few days after transfer to
the floor and linezolid was transitioned to ampicillin as the
patient was believed to have leukosuppression secondary to the
linezolid. She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics (amp and
cefepime) from the time her ANC was greater than 1000 per ID
recommendations and remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable
for the remainder of her hospital course.
.
# Burkitt's Lymphoma: She was admitted on day +15 of [**Hospital1 **]. An
LP with intrathecal chemotherapy was performed on [**2134-10-14**]. A
subclavian line was placed on [**10-15**] and treatment with hyper
CVAD part B was started on [**10-16**]. She tolerated her chemotherapy
well, complicated by mild mucositis and the bacteremia discussed
above. She had one more round of intrathecal chemotherapy with
cytarabine on [**11-4**]. LPs on [**11-18**], and [**11-11**] were negative
for malignant cells. Patient had significant right shoulder and
arm pain as well as right hand weakness, believed secondary to
brachial plexus involvement of her lymphoma. She underwent MRI
of her R shoulder which confirmed this finding and had 4
sessions of XRT as a palliative therapy. She had 4 LP's which
were negative for malignant cells. Had IT cytarabine on [**11-18**]
prior to discharge which she tolerated well. Pt had CT of torso
to evaluate for progression of disease, read at the time of
discharge was pending but will be followed up at follow-up
appointment Monday following discharge when pt will return for
chemotherapy gemcitabine and vinorelbine. Acyclovir and
fluconazole were held given elevated LFTs, will trend LFTs as
outpatient and do liver ultrasound if necessary. Pt was given
pentamidine prior to discharge for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
# Cardiomyopathy: Patient became tachycardic at the time of her
second episode of sepsis. This continued intermittently through
her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay and subsequently on the floor. Tachycardia was
sinus in nature, up into the 140s with movement, and was
attributed to an underlying cardiomyopathy (EF 45-50% on echo,
last on [**10-29**]). Cardiology was consulted for management and she
was started on metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] which she tolerated well.
.
# DVT: Found to have right upper extremity DVT last admission
and was on lovenox for that until she had a drop in platelets
(treatment related). She was thrombocytopenic during her
admission and her lovenox was held. An ultrasound of the arm was
repeated and was negative for clot.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable. Continued Levothyroxine 100mcg PO
daily
.
# Depression: Patient was frequently tearful and endorsed
saddened mood and symptoms of depression. Was started on
citalopram 10 mg daily.

Radiology Report	[**Numeric Identifier 96893**] 3ED ORDER [**Last Name (un) **]/BRACHIOCEPHALIC	Study Date
of [**2174-9-23**] 2:17 AM

IMPRESSION: Selective right internal mammary, right subclavian
and two right
bronchial arteriograms were obtained. No evidence of
extravasation, blush, or
aneurysms could be noticed. All bronchial arteries and branches
presented
with very small caliber. No embolization was attempted via the
right
bronchial intercostal trunk due to supply of midline arteries,
likely directed
towards the spine.

[**9-26**]  Bronchoscopy

IMPRESSION:  Hemoptysis which was related on a previous
procedure to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe,
status post 2 angiograms by interventional radiology with no
embolization performed and status post repeat flexible
bronchoscopy today with a large blood clot in the right upper
lobe bronchus.

PLAN:  We will continue to monitor the patient for the time
being while off Plavix and continue to follow along with
thoracic surgery for the possible need of right upper lobe
lobectomy if the bleeding recurs.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Hemoptysis:
The patient presented with hemoptysis and had an episode of
epistaxis while in the ER. A CT of the chest revealed
non-specific multi-focal ground glass opacities, particularly in
the right lung, and bronchial wall thickening with occlusion of
several airway segments to the right upper and middle lobes.
The patient was observed in the ICU because of the large volume
hemoptysis.  He underwent a bronchoscopy by interventional
pulmonology, but they were unable to visualize the source of the
bleeding because of the large amount of blood in the right upper
lobe. He underwent IR angiography, but they were not able to
visualize the vessel because it was not actively bleeding. The
patient was transferred to the general medical floor
post-procedure where he continued to have small volume
hemoptysis.  Interventional radiology repeated the angiography
but was unable to embolize an artery because there was no active
bleed.  The patient underwent a second bronchoscopy on [**2174-9-26**],
where a clot was found to be nearly occluding the right upper
lobe; the clot was not removed for concern of re-activating the
original bleed.  [**Doctor First Name **], ANCAs, anti-GBM AB, HIV Ab, and PPD were
negative.  His plavix was held since admission, and his
hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s after an initial drop
from Hct 42 in the ED.  The patient did not require any blood
transfusions.  He did get one unit of platelets transfused, per
surgical recommendations, to provide him with more functional
platelets in the setting of recent Plavix use.

The patient was seen and evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Thoracic
Surgery who felt that the risk of Right upper lobectomy was
higher than the risk of significant re-bleeding at this time. No
tumors or cavitary lesions were noted on the CT scan from
admission.  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient in two weeks after re-imaging by CT.

.
#Coronary artery disease:
The patient is s/p 3 vessel CABG in [**2170**] and 2 drug eluting
stents placed in [**2169**].  His plavix was discontinued because his
stents were placed about four years ago.  Upon discharge, he was
started on Aspirin 81mg every other day, per recommendation of
his outpatient cardiologist.  The patient was continued on his
home dose of simvastatin.
.
#Hypertension:
His blood pressure medication was held in the inpatient setting
in order to more effectively monitor his hemodynamic status.
His home dose of valsartan was restarted upon discharge from the
hospital.
.
#Emphysematous changes in lungs:
Emphysematous changes were noted in the patient's lungs on Chest
CT. The patient does have a 20-30 pack-year smoking history,
though he quit smoking one month ago.  He did have Pulmonary
Function Testing done prior to discharge to make sure he could
tolerate a lobectomy.
.
.
.
The patient was continued on him home medications for thyroid
hormone replacement and psoriasis.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were coughing
blood.  Because of the large volume of blood you initially
coughed up, you were monitored in the Intensive Care Unit then
transferred to the general medical floor when stable. As you
know, you were found to have a a blood clot in the right upper
lobe of your lung, which was likely the site of your bleeding.
Duirng your hospitalization, you had two bronchoscopies to
visualize the lung and two procedures by Intervential Radiology
to attempt to find the source of your bleeding.

Emphysema changes were seen as well in your lungs on CT from
your history of smoking. You also had Pulmonary Function Testing
(PFTs) done to test your lung function in case you may need
surgery on your lungs.  Please follow up with your Primary Care
Physician regarding the pulmonary function tests and the
emphysematous changes in your lungs.

As discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], you will be discharged from the
hospital in stable condition.  The risks of surgical removal of
your right upper lung lobe were thought to be greater than the
risk of significant re-bleeding at this time.  You will follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks for re-imaging of your chest.

The following changes were made to your medications:
- Please STOP taking Plavix.  You no longer need to take it for
your coronary stents.
- Please DECREASE the dose and frequency of your aspirin to a
baby aspirin 81mg [**Name2 (NI) **] Other Day.

Please seek medical attention if you cough up more blood, have
lightheadedness or dizziness, or develop any symptoms that are
concerning to you.

elevation of the right hemidiaphragm than the left are
longstanding. There is no evidence of aspiration, no pneumonia
or atelectasis. Lungs are essentially clear. Heart size normal.
No pleural abnormality.
[**2121-7-21**] EGD: Grade 4 esophagitis with spontaneous bleeding was
seen in the lower third of the esophagus. Cold forceps biopsies
were performed for histology at the lower third of the
esophagus. Normal stomach. Normal duodenum.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 yo M with Hx of CVA admitted to [**Hospital1 **] 4 for suicidal
ideation (w/ no plan or attempts) was noted to have coffee
ground emesis twice this evening without prior Hx of GI bleed.
.
# Upper GIB: The patient has no history of gastric, hepatic, or
esopheal pathology. No predisposing medications. 2 peripheral
IV's in place. Pt typed and screened. Hemodynamically stable.
Initial tachycardia was concerning, but orthostatic signs were
negative. Stable Hct can be misleading as it was drawn soon
after episode and patient had not received volume in the
interim. The patient has an active type and scree. The patient's
coffee ground emesis resolved quickly with NG tube and lavage.
An IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] was started. IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] was changed to PO PPI [**Hospital1 **]
on [**7-23**].
.
# Psych: Per the psychiatry team, the patient is Section 12'd
and does not require a 1:1 sitter. Continuing
citalopram/olanzapine. Mental status at baseline per [**Hospital1 **] 4
team. Restarted trileptal.
.
# Hx of CVA: re-started ASA/ Plavix as per GI team's recs.
.
# urinary retention: when foley was pulled initially pt had
difficulty voiding. bladder scan at the time revealed 870cc
residual. straight cath was attempted but this met w/
resistance. Urology was consulted and they recommended
re-instating the foley catheter and starting pt on 0.4mg flomax
daily. the foley was left in place from [**7-25**] to [**7-28**] as per
urology's recs and it was removed on [**7-28**]. He passed his voiding
trial and was accepted for transfer to [**Hospital1 **] 4.

History of Present Illness:
76 year old female s/p CABG ([**2112**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]), critical AS (Valve
area 0.6cm) and left carotid endarterectomy who presented to
[**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital the evening of [**2126-8-29**] with a chief
complaint of chest pain. She states the pain started while she
was resting in bed and was [**7-17**] in severity. The pain was
associated with diaphoresis and a feeling of impending doom. She
states that she can walk 1 flight of stairs before becoming
short of breath, but often has to rest midway up the stairs. She
recently saw her PCP ([**2126-9-23**]) for worsening dyspnea and
tightness in her chest with exertion. She has had chest pain
1-2x/month, typically when performing housework, for which she
takes Nitro with relief of her pain. A TTE [**5-/2126**] showed: LVEF
45%, hypokinesis of the distal/anterior septum, AV peak gradient
61, mean gradient 37. Given the severity of her current episode
of chest pain, she promptly called an ambulance and was brought
to the hospital. She underwent a cradiac catheterization which
revealed clean coronaries, a patent vein graft and severe aortic
stenosis. She is now being referred to cardiac surgery for a
redo sternotomy with aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
3. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 30 %). There is significant inferoseptal,
anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The RCC is severely
calcified and immobile. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST:

The patient has been extubated, and there has been removal of
orogastric tube, pulmonary arterial catheter, chest tubes, and
mediastinal drains. A right IJ sheath remains in unchanged
position. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are
again noted, in unchanged position and alignment.

The lung volumes are lower. There are bilateral pleural
effusions, left
greater than right, with bibasilar atelectasis, worst in the
retrocardiac
region and increased from prior study. There is no opacity to
suggest
pneumonia. Prior left pneumothorax has resolved. Mediastinal
contours are
stable, with expected post-operative widening and stable
cardiomegaly.
Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Calcification of the
aortic knob is re-demonstrated.

IMPRESSION: Interval removal of numerous supportive and
monitoring devices.  Decreased lung volumes, with bilateral left
greater than right effusions and associated atelectasis.
Resolution of prior left pneumothorax. Decreased
vascular congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6164**] was a same day admit and on [**2126-10-15**] was brought
directly to the operating room where she underwent a
redo-sternotomy, aortic valve replacement. Please see operative
note for surgical details.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.

Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight. Pt went into afib post op. Amio
was started. pt in afib longer then 24 hrs. Coumadin was
iniated, and now on a amio taper with coumadin for new onset
afib.The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility. Gently diuresed toward her preop weight.  She proved
to be somewhat sensitive to coumadin and was treated with FFP
when she was supratherapeutic.

By the time of discharge on POD 10 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.Target INR
2.0-2.5 for A Fib. First blood draw tomorrow [**10-26**].

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-27**] 10:02 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-26**], there is little
change in the
minimal right apical pneumothorax. Pigtail catheter remains in
place. Some
areas of increased opacification was seen in the right mid and
lower zones,
consistent most likely with atelectasis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-27**] 1:55 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is no
change in the small apical pneumothorax on the right following
clamping of the chest tube.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2163-2-28**] at 2:38:43 PM      FINAL

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-11-4**],
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-28**] 5:32 AM
FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of right-sided pigtail
catheter.
Tiny right apical pneumothorax likely still persists. Bilateral
areas of
atelectasis are again noted to be increased bilaterally and
there maty be
increasing vascular congestion. Otherwise, little change in
comparison to
prior study from yesterday.






Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old female with h/o hypothyoidism, HTN/HL, AAA s/p
repair, known prior stage I lung adenoCA s/p limited resection
with new RLL lung mass along with multiple ground glass
opacities with new RLL lesion showing new squamous cell CA,
admitted with hypotensiona and fever concerning for pna.

The patient was admitted with hypotension, fever, and
leukocytosis.  Her admission labs and chest xray were concerning
for the development of a healthcare-associated pneumonia (she
underwent bronchoscopy a couple of days prior to admission) and
she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.

Ms. [**Known lastname 3441**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3442**] septic physiology which was initially
responsive to IV fluid resuscitation in the ICU.  Despite
treatment with antibitoics, however, she developed worsening
hypoxia and respiratory distress which required intubation.  She
became intermittently hypotensive while intubated and required
vasopressors.

Her ICU course was complicated by bilateral infiltrates on chest
xray which were ultimately thought to represent ARDS vs.
pulmonary edema.  She also suffered a demand myocardial
infarction in the ICU with resultant apical hypokinesis on
echocardiography.  Cardiology was consulted and the patient was
treated along the ACS pathway.

Given her underlying cancer, which was known to be progressing,
and the severity of her acute illness with refractory
respiratory failure, possible ARDS, and ongoing hypotension,
many family meetings took place with members of the ICU team.
In keeping with the patient's wishes, the [**Known lastname 3441**] family decided to
focus on comfort and withdraw life-supporting.  She was
terminally extubated on [**2163-3-7**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26644**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2158-4-27**] for
surgical management of his coronary artery disease. He was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid
duplex ultrasound which showed less then a 40% stenosis
bilaterally. Plavix was allowed to washout of his system. On
[**2158-5-3**], Mr. [**Known lastname 26644**] was taken to the operating room where
he underwent off pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Please
see operative note for details.
In summary he had:
1. Urgent off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x4, left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, obtuse    marginal and
posterior descending arteries.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He woke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Amiodarone was started for rapid atrial fibrillation. He
required close monitoring of his pulmonary status. After
aggressive diuresis and weaning from pressor support he was
transferred on postoperative day four to the step down unit for
further recovery. The remainder of his hospital stay was
uneventful, he worked with physical therapy and nursing to
increase his  strength and mobility. On POD5 he was discharged
home with visiting nurses and home physical therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 87 y/o F with h/o of NSCLC p/w malaise and abdominal pain,
found to be hyponatremic.
.
Malaise: Pt much improved after IVF. Suspect combination
hyponatremia, hypothyroid, poor po intake, and chemotherapy
(Navelbine). EKG with non-specific changes, pt refuses
telemonitor and negative CE x 3. [**Last Name (LF) 96963**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] manage
hyponatremia and hypothyroid as below.
.
#.Hyponatremia: The patient appeared hypovolemic on admission
with a sodium of 127 and a serum osm of 282. The patient was
given 1L of NS and corrected to 133.  The patient was given
another liter of NS throughout the day.  The patient was stable
and w/o mental status changes.  Throughout the evening the
patient continued to urinate frequently.  On [**6-27**] the repeat
morning sodium was 120 and a serum osm of 256.  The patients
history of lung cancer and hypothyroid make SIADH the likely
cause of her hyponatermia.  The patient was placed on 750ml
fluid restriction and lytes were checked TID, her Na dipped to
117 but then increased to 120-122 with fluid restriction to
500ml.  She was then made NPO and her UO dropped to 60ml in 12
hours but her Na remained at 120, she triggered for blood
pressure to 80s/50s and she was transferred to the ICU for
hypertonic saline and intensive nursing care.
.
#. Abdominal Pain: The patient had compliants of chronic
abdominal pain throughout the day and evening.  The patient has
a history of mesentric ischemia s/p celiac stent, IBS and
gastritis/ duodenitis s/p EGD on [**6-25**].  The patient also had
complaints of mild nausea and small amount of clear/whitish
liquid vomiting.  The was started on a ppi and both IV and po
anti-emetics, however the patient would intermittently refuse
medications citing that they would upset her stomach.  The
patient would intermittently tolerate small amounts of po
intake.  The patient was sent for an abdominal U/S to evaluate
her celiac stent which showed decreased velocity from previous
study.  Additionally, a guaic stool was sent as well as LFTs and
Hct, which were within normal limits.  [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery was
consulted and they felt that mesenteric ischemia was very
unlikely.
#Hypothyroid: Pt TSH was 6.1.  Pt admits to non-compliance of
levothyroxine.  Pt was educated on hypothyroid and importance of
med compliance.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for malaise and hyponatremia (low
sodium).  You sodium at your primary care doctor's office and in
the emergency department were low.  We restricted your fluids
and measured your sodium level very closely and it increased.
You will need to follow up closely with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] and get your
sodium checked to make sure it doesn't get low again.

You were also found to be hypothyroid.  This was probably due to
not taking your thyroid medicine regularly.  You were restarted
on your thyroid medication during your stay and should continue
taking this.

You were also found to be anemic with low red blood cell counts.
We transfused you two units of blood while you were in the
hospital. You will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] and your oncologists
to get repeat blood counts.

You had some back pain and left leg pain while you were here as
well. An X-ray of your back showed only some degenerative disc
disease and you were started on a new medicine, gabapentin
(Neurontin) 100mg three times a day. You should folow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] to discuss whether to continue this medicine and for
how long.

While you were in the hospital, we held your chemotherapy and
radiation until your white blood cell counts improve. You should
follow-up in Radiation Oncology on Wednesday, [**7-7**] at 7:30am
to have your counts rechecked. You should also follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**Month (only) 205**] .

liquids.
Please see official note in OMR for further details.


Brief Hospital Course:
As noted in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted in the trauma bay to
have bilateral mangled extremities.  He also had an absent
radial pulse on the left side prompting vascular surgery
involvement.  He was noted to have extensively mangled bilateral
upper extremities as well as a left buttock soft tissue injury
that did not appear to track to bone.  Orthopedics, plastics and
vascular surgery were consulted in addition to the acute care
surgery team and he was taken to the OR directly from the trauma
bay.
.
Please refer to the individual operative summaries from the
various teams providing care from [**2191-6-24**] for specific details
but, in brief, vascular surgery performed a thrombectomy of the
left brachial artery with primary repair of arteriotomy after
initial debridement and washout by ACS and orthopedics.  The
wounds were wrapped and a vac was applied to the buttock wound.
He was taken to the Trauma ICU postoperatively.
.
Patient underwent one more debridement surgery on [**2191-6-28**] and
then and initial reconstructive surgery of bilateral upper
extremities with skin grafts and integra on [**2191-7-5**].
.
Patient's mental status improved after ICU stay and he was alert
and able to carry on conversations with staff.  At times he was
A+Ox3 but at other times confused.  He is able to recall the dog
attack.  Geriatric team felt fluctuations in mental status were
multifactorial and related to trauma, de-conditioning, ICU stay,
sleep deprivation, pain medications.  They felt that this would
gradually improve over time and with supportive care.
.
Neuro: He was intubated and sedated in the immediate
post-operative period and for several days while in the TICU.
He was on fentanyl and propofol for pain control and sedation
during this time.  When he was awake and extubated, his pain was
controlled with IV dilaudid for dressing changes and oxycodone
for complaints of pain in between.
.
Cardiovascular: He did not require vasopressors in the
post-operative period.  He was hemodynamically stable.  He did
have a history of paroxysmal afib but was in normal sinus
rhythym for most of his admission.  His coumadin was held during
this admission and he was prophylactically anticoagulated with
once daily lovenox injections.
.
Heme: Patient required multiple blood product transfusions
during his ICU stay due to loss of blood at the scene of the
attack and subsequently due to oozing open wounds. Geriatrics
was consulted for help with managing patient once he was
transferred to the floor and onto Plastics surgery service.
Geriatrics recommended starting patient on thiamine, folate and
MVI for h/o heavy EtOH and persistent anemia post-traumatic
event and subsequent surgeries.
.
Resp: Initially, he was intubated with an ETT on MMV and CMV,
eventually weaned to CPAP and then successfully extubated on
[**2191-6-30**].  Patient continued to improve his respiratory status
post extubation.  On hospital day #19, there was a question as
to whether patient may have aspirated after a meal when his head
of bed was lowered.  Patient was encouraged to cough and deep
breathe and his vital signs/O2 sats remained stable.  He was
ordered for albuterol nebulizer treatments PRN for wheezes.
.
GI/nutrition: In the post-operative period, he had an OGT placed
and was started on tube feeds under the guidance of Nutrition.
Patient received isosource 1.5 with a goal rate of 60 cc/hr.  He
tolerated these well.  When patient was awake and alert, Speech
and Swallowing was consulted to assess the patient's safety
eating different consistencies of foods and liquids.  A video
swallow revealed evidence of some aspiration of thin liquids so
patient was placed on soft/ground diet which he tolerated well.
Patient self d/c'd his Dobhoff tube and it was not replaced due
to ability to take POs.  Patient required 1:1 assistance with
all of his meals and snacks.  Patient with cumulative
nutritional deficit due to events related to trauma and
reconstruction.  Albumin 2.3 from initial albumin of 2.9.
Snacks and supplemental puddings were encouraged.
.
Renal: He had a foley catheter and maintained good urine output.
 His creatinine was elevated on admission and trended down to
1.4 at discharge.  His electrolytes were repleted PRN. He was
given lasix/albumin to assist with his edema on HD 5.  Patient's
foley was maintained for inpatient stay due to inability to
utilize a urinal manually d/t bilateral upper extremity injuries
and dressings.
.
ID: He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics,
vanc/zosyn/clinda.  Infectious Disease was consulted on [**2191-6-25**]
to help with antibiotic guidance and postexposure rabies
vaccinations.  Patient received Rabies Immune Globulin 1650 UNIT
IM ONCE within 24-hours of arrival and then Rabies vaccine on
days 1, 3, 7 and 14. The clindamycin was dc'd on [**2191-6-28**] due to
lessened concern for a necrotizing soft tissue infection.  Blood
cultures were negative.  A tissue sample obtained in the OR from
left elbow grew VRE so Vancomycin was discontinued and patient
was maintained on zosyn IV until [**2191-7-11**].  Patient remained
negative C.difficele despite multiple loose stools/day.
.
Prophylaxis: Patient was maintained on Lovenox 40 mg QD for DVT
prophylaxis and wore pneumo boots while in bed.  He was assisted
in and out of bed to chair when he was able to tolerate
transfers.  Patient was assisted to use his incentive
spirometer.
.
TLD: He had a right groin CVL placed during the initial trauma
evaluation.  This was removed in the OR and he had a right IJ
CVL placed which remained in place until day of discharge to
rehab when it was removed.
.
At the time of discharge on hospital day #19, the patient was
doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a soft
mechanical diet and supervised thin liquids, getting out of bed
to chair with mechanical lift, foley catheter draining clear
yellow urine, and pain was well controlled.  Bilateral upper
extremities (BUE) with skin grafts and integra in place to wound
without evidence of infection or breakdown.  BUEs with daily
dressing changes with xeroform, gauze fluffs, kerlix and ace
wraps.  Left forearm/hand with custom orthoplast splint in
place.  Wound vac dressing intact and patent to left posterior
buttock/flank wound (last vac change [**7-11**]).  Bilateral thigh

Addendum:
The patient was ready to go home with VNA services on [**2129-12-22**].
Approximately at 11 am, patient developed severe nausea and she
vomited x 3. She was started on IV fluids and her discharge was
put on hold. The patient was stable, afebrile with vital signs
within normal limits. Approximately at 3 pm, patient was found
to have rigors, her vital signs revealed hypotension with SBP to
the 70s, and hyperglycemia with FS 470s and altered mental
status. The patient received IV fluid bolus (2L LR), SC insulin
and was transferred to ICU for further management. Her blood
revealed increased leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and
Cre 1.7 (0.4-0.6 baseline). The patient was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics, levophed gtt to maintain BP and agressive
fluid resuscitation, NGT was placed. Abdominal CT scan revealed
LLL consolidations, persistent 2.9 x 1.3 cm rim enhancing
aortocaval fluid collection near the liver hilum and was grossly
stable compare with CT from [**12-15**]. With interventions patient
continue to improve. Her BP stabalized and pressors were weaned
off, hyperglycemia improved with insulin, Cre started to
downward with fluids. WBC started to downward 26->19.8->12.6
with abx treatment. Her blood, urine and stool samples were sent
for culture. Patient received 2 units of pRBC and HCT improved
(24->30.2), and her mental status returned to her baseline. The
patient returned to the floor on [**2129-12-24**]. Her urine and stool
cultures were negative, last blood cultures still pendind.
Patient's Cre returned back to normal, her Bactrim and

Chief Complaint:
Metastatic brain lesions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**9-23**]: Right parietal Craniotomy for Mass resection


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 yo woman with PMHx sig. for breast cancer
diagnosed in [**11/2098**] s/p chemotherapy followed by Herceptin who
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with seizures, was found to have
metastatic brain lesion, and transferred for XRT of metastatic
brain lesions.

Patient had a PET scan in [**8-20**] that was normal except a low
attenuation lesion in R parietal lobe.  Outpatient brain MRI on
[**2100-9-17**] showed 1.2 cm right parietal mass with extensive edema
c/w sole metastasis.

On Sunday evening, she presented with new seizures.  The
patient's son was sitting with her when she began to have
jerking of her left arm.  She recalls that her arm was
""trembling"" and then she cannot recall any further events.  She
then developed slurred speech and L facial droop.  She was taken
to the ED, where she was agitated and confused.  She received
ativan 4 mg, phenytoin loading, and dexamethason 6 mg IV.  She
was seen by Neurology and Oncology, who felt that the patient
would be candidate for gamma knife or neurosurgical removal
followed by XRT.  She is transferred for evaluation of these
treatments.  She has had no seizures since being hospitalized at
[**Location (un) **].  She did receive at 8 AM on [**2100-9-20**] for agitation.
She also received dilantin IV and Decadron IV.  Vitals prior to
transfer were:  97.4 124/66 65 20 100% on 5L.

OSH Imaging:
[**2100-9-7**], PET CT:  No abnormal FDG-Avid abnormalities to suggest
recurrent or metastatic idsease.  Not previously localized focus
of low attenuation which is partially seen in the high posterior
right parietal lobe.

[**2100-9-17**], MRI brain with or without contrast:  1.2 cm R parietal
intraparenchymal enhancing mass with extensive vasogenic edema
is hgih suspicious for metastatic neoplasm.  The lesion is
located with the post central gyrus and edema extends to the
motor cortex.  There is no associated sig. midline shift or
downward herniation.

[**2100-9-19**], head CT without contrast:  Area of hypoattenuation in
the R post central gyrus with a nodular focus of hyperdensity.

[**2100-9-19**], CXR:  Limited study not including portions of the
lower lobes with suggestion of cardiomegaly without failure.

MRI Brain [**9-24**]
Right posterior frontal/parietal 2-cm lesion at the surface of
the brain, likely dural-based metastatic lesions. Surrounding
edema is seen.  No midline shift or hydrocephalus. No change in
appearance

[**9-25**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Right frontoparietal post-surgical
changes with small amount of blood products and focus of air
within the post-surgical cavity with surrounding vasogenic
edema. Pneumocephalus over the right frontal lobe.  Mild right
cerebral hemispheric edema with effacement of the sulci. No
midline shift.

[**9-25**] Head MRI: IMPRESSION: Limited study with no
post-gadolinium T1 images obtained for assessment of residual
mass. No diffusion images. Blood products and postoperative
changes in the right parietal region are as expected. For better
assessment, consider repeat gadolinium study.

[**9-27**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION:
1. Post-surgical changes, similar in appearance with small
amount of
hemorrhagic products, edema and pneumocephalus as expected. No
new hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. 2. No
definite abnormal enhancement. Please note that MRI is more
sensitive for detection of residual disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo woman with PMHx sig. for breast cancer diagnosed in
[**11/2098**] s/p chemotherapy followed by Herceptin who presented to
[**Hospital **] Hospital with seizures, was found to have metastatic
brain lesion, and transferred for XRT of metastatic brain
lesions.
.
# Metastatic breast cancer to the brain/Seizure: The patient was
continued on decadron and phenytoin with a therapeutic level.
She was seen by the neuro-oncology service, neurosurgery
service, and the radiation oncology service. After long
discussion with her two sons, the patient opted for
neurosurgical treatment of her solitary brain metastasis and was
transferred on the neurosurgery service on [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**9-23**].
An initial speech and swallowing study obtained while the
patient was recommended soft solids.
.
# Encephalopathy, metabolic:  The patient was initially
extremely lethargic, although arousable and able to follow
commands, which was thought to be secondary to the large doses
of ativan that she received for her seizure. By the second
hospital day the patient's mental status was completely back to
baseline and she remained oriented and interactive.
.
# Acute renal failure:
- IVFs
- monitor Cr

The patient was trasnferred to the neurosurgery service on the
evening of [**9-23**] from the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] in order to undergo
surgical resection of her brain mass. She had an MRI WAND study
overnight on [**9-23**] for surgical planning with plan for OR [**9-24**]
am. On the morning of [**9-24**] she was brought to the pre-op area
however her case had to be reshceduled for the evening.  She
remained stable on the floor while awaiting her operation.
Surgery was performed without complication. She was admitted to
the ICU post op for close neurological monitoring. The patient's
post-operative neurologic examination remained unchanged.
Post-op MRI revealed no evidence of new CVA or residual tumor.

On [**9-25**]- [**9-27**] she was neurologically stable. She was cleared
for transfer to the floor. Post operative imaging was performed
which revealed post operative changes and no hemorrhage. PT and
OT were consulted and recommended discharge to a rehab facility.

On [**9-28**] she was cleared for discharge to rehab facility pending
bed availability.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. A large (2 cm) mass attached to the lateral aspect of the
tricuspid valve
annulus is seen in the right atrium.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is difficult to assess but is probably low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
4.. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is at
least moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2). Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.

Intra-op TEE [**2163-5-27**]
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. A left atrial
appendage thrombus cannot be excluded.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is a dissection
flap visible originating in the aortic sinus and extending into
the distal arch at the level of the left subclavian artery.The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV paciong for slow
ventricular response. 3 leaflet native aortic valve with normal
movement , now with 1+ AI. MR [**Last Name (Titles) 107596**] [**12-6**]+. Preserved
biventricular systolic functiojn. Ascending aortic graft without
leak or visible dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought emergently to the Operating Room on
[**2163-5-27**] for type A dissection, after initial assessment he
underwent emergent Ascending aortic/hemi-arch aorta replacement
with 30-mm Gelweave graft and resuspension of the aortic valve.
His HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST TIME was 19 minutes,
cardiopulmonary bypass TIME was 131 minutes, and a CROSS-CLAMP
TIME of 76 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He was supported
with pressors in the immediate post-op period, initial attempts
to wake and wean from ventilator failed due to hypoxia, his
post-op CXR was wet and he required additional diuresis prior to
extubation. during subsequent attempts to wean from ventilator
he developed atrial fibrillation, he converted to sinus rhythm
with amiodarone and Bblockers.  He was extubated on POD 3, after
which he experienced post-op delerium, which improved with
Haldol and  discontinuation of narcotics. He had cleared by the
following day and transferred from ICU to stepdown floor.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD eight the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing, pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location 1268**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Chief Complaint:
bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with a pmh of a-fib on coumadin, and dCHF who began
having crampy abdominal pain last night and BRBPR starting at
11pm. He described the pain as diffuse, crampy abdominal pain,
not worse in any particular area, and bright red blood mixed
with brown stool last night. He denies any fevers, chills, CP,
cough, dysuria, myalgias, or shortness of breath. He is a little
tired and feels ""chilled"" this AM. Otherwise negative review of
systems.
.
In the ED: No active bleeding was noted, his HCT dropped from
31->24 since [**2188-9-3**]. Labs also notable for INR of 3.6. His BPs
were initially 88 systolic, he got 1L NS, 2units FFP (2nd
running at transfer), no red cells, and BPs responded to around
100 systolic. EKG showed Twave flattening, he had a trop of 0.08
(baseline 0.07). GI rec'd CTA which showed diverticulosis, no
active extravasation, streak artifact from hip. There was late
phase filling in the spleen which was not thought to be a site
of active bleeding. He received vitamin K 10mg, and Protonix 40
IV. While receiving the first unit of FFP he had itching and
hives, for which he got 50mg of Benadryl which caused AMS, now
resolved. Continued FFP. 18 and 16 PIV. Transfer vitals 81
106/60 19 100% 4L. small blood around meatus.

IMAGING:

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2188-9-7**] 7:04 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without signs of acute
diverticulitis.  No CTA signs of active bleeding within the
small or large bowel lumen, though limited evaluation in the
bowel loops in the pelvis due to streak artifact from adjacent
right hip total arthroplasty.

2. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and
moderate on the left.

3. Focal enhancement in the posterior spleen on delayed phase
images,
possible hemangioma or AV malformation.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with a pmh of a-fib and dCHF on coumadin and
aspirin who presented with a lower GI bleed in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

GI bleed: Likely due to known severe diverticulosis, exacerbated
by supratherapeutic INR from coumadin, as well as being on
aspirin.  Source is most likely lower given BRBPR mixed with
stool. However, his BUN/Cr ratio was elevated, though this
relationship has been present in historical blood draws. He was
given FFP and 10 mg Vitamin K in the ED and subsequently sent to
the MICU. He had a maroon bowel movement x1 in the MICU and
received 2 units PRBCs with an appropriate increase. CTA showed
diverticulosis with no signs of active bleeding.  His vitals and
hematocrit remained stable, no further episodes of bloody bowel
movements.  The patient was offered colonoscopy, however upon
discussion with his son, he decided that he would rather not
undergo the procedure.  Given that he was medically stable and
his bleed was likely due to diverticulosis in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR, this seemed a perfectly reasonable choice.
 He was warned, however, that the CTA could not adequately rule
out other sources of bleeding such as AVM or new malignancy that
has evolved since last colonoscopy in [**2178**] (though this is
unlikely).  He should follow up with his PCP as an outpatient to
have hematocrit checked and ensure that he is no longer having
blood in his BMs.

Atrial fibrillation: Has a history of a-fib, and has been on
coumadin since [**2185**] (CHADS2 score is 2). Mildly supratherapeutic
INR to 3.6 in ED. In setting of LGIB, INR was reversed with
vitamin K and FFP.  Coumadin held while inpatient, continued
rate control w metoprolol. The patient was instructed to not
restart the coumadin until his follow up with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] he will
need to discuss with him the risks/benefits of continuing
coumadin in the the setting of GI bleed.

INACTIVE ISSUES:

Diastolic CHF, chronic: Appeared euvolemic with a stable right
sided pleural effusion. Given GI bleed, lasix, lisinopril
(recently DC'd) and metoprolol were initially held.  Metoprolol
restarted at half dose, lasix and lisinopril were not restarted
on discharge.  Defer decision on restarting to PCP.

TRANSFER OF CARE ISSUES:
- GI bleed: recheck hgb/hct as outpatient, consider outpatient
colonoscopy if patient continues to have blood w his BMs
- Coumadin:  assess risks and benefits prior to restarting.
Because his INR was reversed and coumadin stopped, he will need
heparin bridging if he is to restart therapy.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 101773**],

You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] because of bleeding with your
stool. You required transfusions of blood and blood products.
You had a high INR - or coumadin level. We believe that this INR
contributed to the bleeding but the [**Last Name **] problem was likely in
the colon, possibly diverticulosis. We discussed the risks and
benefits of a colonoscopy and ultimately you decided to discuss
this with your regular doctors.

Moving forward, we ask you to do the following:
1. STOP Coumadin
2. STOP Lisinopril
3. REDUCE the dose of your Metoprolol to a HALF pill twice daily
(12.5 mg)
4. STOP Lasix (at least until your primary care appointment)

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Admit to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for post op medical management.  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course as
below.  transferred to the floor late in the evening on POD1

2. Geriatric c/s for medical co-management

3. Post-op anemia - POD2 Hct 25.5 -> 1u PRBC, POD3 Hct 24.5,
asymptomatic -> Transfused additional 1u PRBCs.  POD5 HCT 24.3
-> 1u PRBCs, POD6 -> HCT 22.6 -> 2u PRBCs

4. Neuro consult for R foot motor deficit - incomplete study,
but no obvious nerve compression.

5. Hematuria and urinary retention - Started on Bactrim
prophylactically. Hematura cleared spontaneously. Patient was
unable to void, straight cathed x many, when urine culture
confirmed negative, stopped Bactrim and foley placed [**7-5**]. Foley
removed [**2148-7-9**] at 6am but patient failed voising trial, bladder
scanned > 400cc after 6 hrs. Foley replaced, increased terazosin
15mg daily, repeat voiding trial [**2148-7-13**] at 6am.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with IV pain meds
followed by a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The
patient received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the
morning of POD#1. The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and
the surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without
erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly
intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity.

Mr. [**Known lastname 17922**] is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:

74M with DM, HTN, CAD, Parkinson's s/p R TKR experienced low UOP
and AMS in PACU and transferred to MICU. AMS likely secondary to
narcotics, low urine output secondary to under-rescuscitation.

ACUTE ISSUES:

# Anemia: Received 4L crystalloid + 0.5L colloid in the OR
during the procedure. He also received 1 unit PRBCs. He was
given another 1 un PRBCs with lasix upon arrival to the ICU. His
Hct responded appropriately with an increase from 25.2 to 28.8.

# AMS: Pt was very somnolent on arrival but was arousable.
Attributed to a combination of narcotics and underlying
Parkinson's disease. The patient had no focal neurologic
deficits so further imaging of the head was not obtained. He
became significantly more interactive throughout his course and
on transfer was at baseline.

# CAD/hyperlipidemia: Requires antiplatelet therapy s/p stents.
The patient's [**Hospital Unit Name **] and [**Hospital Unit Name 4532**] were restarted after consulting
with orthopedics.

# s/p TKR: Patient was in repositiong device during stay.
Started on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.

STABLE ISSUES:

# [**Last Name (un) **]/low UOP: Cr on admission was slightly higher than baseline
(1.3 vs 1.0-1.2).  The patient is s/p nephrectomy, which
combined with intraop blood loss probably contributed to his
[**Last Name (un) **]. Urine output responded to lasix

# DM2: Patient was placed back on home insulin at 40 units of
70/30 [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale. Sugars remained well controlled.

# HTN: SBPs were up to 160s in MICU. The patient was restarted
on home metoprolol dose. His home valsartan and HCTZ were held
pending followup creatinine. Cr remained stable at 1.3 at the
time of transfer.

# Parkinson's: Stable. Continued on home carbidopa-levodopa.

# BPH: Stable, home finasteride and terazosin continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: F/u outpatient as per ortho.

(ICD9 CODE: 999.7)
INDICATION FOR CONSULT:	DIFFICULT CROSSMATCH AND/OR EVALUATION
OF IRREGULAR ANTIBODIES

INDICATIONS FOR CONSULT:
Difficult crossmatch and/or evaluation of irregular antibody (s)

CLINICAL/LAB DATA: Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] is a 59 year old male who was
admitted
with renal and hepatic dysfunction, as well as a picture
concerning for
sepsis/DIC. A blood sample was sent for type and screen.

Laboratory Data:
Patient ABO/Rh: Group O, Rh positive
Antibody screen: Positive
DAT: 3+ IgG, 1+ C3
Eluate: panagglutination of all cells
Antibody identity: Panagglutinating antibody ([**Hospital1 18**]); anti-Jkb
identified by the American Red Cross reference laboratory after
performing heterologous adsorption [required due to recent
transfusion]
Antigen phenotype: performed [**2192-7-8**]- E, K, Jkb, Fya,
Fyb-antigen
negative

Transfusion history:
7 non-reactive red cell transfusions during previous admission
[**Date range (2) 85487**] (5 of 7 units retrospectively determined to be
positive
for Jkb)

Previous non-reactive plasma transfusions: 123 (in setting of
plasmapheresis)

Previous non-reactive platelet transfusions: 2

DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] has a
new
diagnosis of Anti-Jkb antibody, in addition to his known warm
autoantibody. Jkb-antigen is a member of the Kidd blood group
system.
Jkb-antibody is clinically significant and capable of causing
hemolytic
transfusion reactions. During his last admission [**Date range (2) 85487**],
Mr.
[**Known lastname 74316**] received 5 units of Jkb positive blood. These units
will
likely be cleared more quickly than Jkb negative units. The ICU
team
was made aware that delayed hemolysis could be taking place,
although it
will be difficult to assess in the face of his other lab
abnormalities.
In the future, Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] should receive Jkb-antigen negative
products
for all red cell transfusions. Approximately 26% of all ABO
compatible
blood will be Jkb-antigen negative. A wallet card and a letter
stating
the above will be sent to the patient.
.
# ECHO [**2192-7-30**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 40-45 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. with
depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-7-9**],
biventricular systolic function now appears mildly depressed.
.
#CT OF THE ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

In the visualized thorax, there is septal thickening in the left
lower lobe that is consistent with pulmonary edema. Proximally
there are small nodular densities. There is mild basilar
atelectasis, worse on the left. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The visualized heart is normal in size with a
trace pericardial effusion. Relative attenuation of the
ventricles relative to muscle suggests anemia.

Evaluation of the solid organs in the abdomen is limited without
intravenous contrast. Calcific foci are seen within the liver
and spleen suggesting prior granulomatous insult. A sliver of
fluid is seen between the hepatic parenchyma and the gallbladder
(series 2, image 25). There is no pericholecystic fat stranding.
The pancreas and adrenals appear normal.
There is a 1.7-cm diameter hypodensity within the lower pole of
the left
kidney and a second 1.2-cm hypodensity in the interpolar region,
incompetely characterized. Abdominal loops of small bowel appear
normal without distension or pericolonic fat stranding. There is
moderate fecal loading of the large bowel. The appendix is not
clearly visualized, but there are no secondary signs to suggest
appendicitis. There is no abdominal free air, free fluid, or
pathologic lymphadenopathy.

Pelvic loops of bowel appear normal. The bladder and distal
ureters appear
normal. The prostate measures to 5 cm.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or
osteoblastic lesion.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen with prominent
Schmorl's nodes at
L3-L4.

IMPRESSION:
1. Sliver of pericholecystic fluid adjacent to the hepatic wall
may reflect
liver pathology rather than acute cholecystitis given no
definitive
gallbladder wall edema or adjacent fat stranding. Nonetheless
recommend US
for further characterization.
2. Left renal cysts are incompletely characterized. These can be
evaluated
concurrently with gallbladder
3. Left lower lobe septal thickening and proximal nodularity are
consistent
with focal edema and an inflammatory/infectious process.
3. Moderate fecal loading.
4. Enlarged prostate.
5. Anemia

# [**2192-7-30**] 2:17 PM
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL; DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL)
Comparison is made to prior CT examination
dated [**2192-7-30**]. The echotexture of the liver is unremarkable
except for a
1.1-cm slightly hyperechoic lesion in segment VIII of the liver.
A similarly hyperechoic region is seen more medially in segment
VIII. This measures 1.3 cm. These areas do not demonstrate color
flow consistent with hemangiomas. There is gallbladder wall
edema; however, the gallbladder is not distended. There are no
stones in the gallbladder. No pericholecystic fluid is noted.
The gallbladder wall edema causes wall thickening up to 6.5 mm.
On color flow and Doppler images, there is normal flow in the
main portal vein. Adequate flow is also identified in the left
portal vein. There is normal flow visualized in the hepatic
veins, although it was difficult to obtain waveforms as the
patient was unable to hold his breath for a sufficiently long
period of time.

IMPRESSION:
1. Portal vein and its branches as well as hepatic veins are
patent.

2. Gallbladder wall edema, the presence of a non-distended
gallbladder most
consistent with hypoalbuminemia or liver disease.

3. Too small hyperechoic lesions in the liver are most
consistent with
hemangiomas.
.
# [**2192-8-4**] 4:08 AM CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lungs are grossly
clear
except for a patchy area of opacity in the left retrocardiac
region, which has slightly improved when compared to an earlier
radiograph of 15th at 5:43 a.m. This is most likely atelectasis
and less likely an infectious pneumonia.
.
# [**2192-8-6**] 11:15 AM CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
New poorly well-defined round opacities and right mid and left
lower lung, concerning for infection such as septic emboli or
fungal
organisms. Consider chest CT for confirmation and further
characterization.
.
# [**2192-8-6**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:
There has been partial resolution of the diffuse ground-glass
opacities since the previous CT with residual well-demarcated
ground-glass opacities which are predominantly in the right
upper lobe (2.27) and the right lung base, to a lesser extent.
The appearances of these abnormalities are similar to the
previous CT with no newly affected areas. Pleural surfaces are
smooth with no pleural effusion. Linear atelectasis is new and
mild in the lower lobes bilaterally with thickening of the left
major fissure due to mild atelectasis.

Several lung cysts which were accentuated by the ground-glass
opacities in the prior study are now separate to the lung
abnormality; these may represent sequelae of previous
hemorrhage, i.e. prior hematoceles. Paraseptal emphysema is
mild.

The pulmonary artery is enlarged at 37 mm, slightly larger than
on the
previous study suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension. The
caliber of the aorta and heart size is normal,no pericardial
effusion. Relative hypodensity in the cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] in
comparison to the myocardium suggests anemia.

Although this examination was not designed for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation.
review of the upper abdominal organs is unremarkable. Punctate
calcification in the liver and spleen in addition to several
calcified mediastinal lymph nodes suggest prior granulomatous
exposure.

No destructive or sclerotic bone lesions are concerning for
malignancy.

IMPRESSION:

1)Partial resolution of the diffuse ground-glass opacities which
are
predominantly in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe to a
lesser extent. These abnormalities appear to have cleared over
several intervening chest radiographs and suggest recurrent
pulmonary hemorrhage, particularly given the coexistent
thrombocytopenia, other causes such as infection (PCP) are less
likely.

2)Liver, splenic and mediastinal lymph node calcifications
suggest prior
granulomatous exposure.
.
# [**2192-8-6**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
other
CT sign of acute major vascular territorial infarction. The
ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and configuration.

There are fluid levels within the left maxillary, right frontal
and bilateral sphenoid sinuses, as well as complete
opacification of left frontal sinus. Aeration of the ethmoid air
cells has improved since the prior study. Wall thickening in the
sphenoid and possibly also frontal sinuses suggests chronic
sinusitis. High-density material within the paranasal sinuses
suggests inspissated secretions, hemorrhagic secretions, or
fungal colonization. It is not clear whether there are
postsurgical changes in the incompletely evaluated nasal cavity.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of other acute
intracranial
abnormalities.
2. Chronic sinusitis. Fluid in the paranasal sinuses may
indicate the
presence of an acute component. High density contents within the
sinuses may reflect inspissated secretions, hemorrhagic
secretions, or fungal
colonization.

Brief Hospital Course:
# HLH:
Clinical scenario consistent with HLH.  Pt was admitted with
severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. He has had 4 days of ATG,
which was stopped early due to neutropenia - he later received
the 5th dose when neutropenia resolved. Pt was also placed on
high dose IV steriods, initially solumedrol 120mg [**Hospital1 **] that were
ultimately tapered to prednisone 40mg [**Hospital1 **] by beginning of [**Month (only) 205**].
Only possible cause of HLH that could be identified was ? of CMV
infection with two different viral load tests showing positive
viral load. Pt ended up getting two bone marrow biopsies ([**7-9**]
and [**8-14**]) which both showed evidence of some hemophagycytosis.
The liver biopsy on [**8-8**] showed no evidence of malignancy,
necrosis, or infections. The pathology present was predominantly
cholestatic and most consistent with drug induced changes. Pt
was held off other chemotherapeutic regimens for the first 6
weeks of the hospitalization because of his combined renal
failure and liver cholestasis. Once pt recovered renal function
and was declared by nephrology to no longer required
hemodialysis, he was started on low dose cyclosporine 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
on the evening of [**8-23**]. Initial trough value was very low (<30)
two days later.  His cyclosporine was gradually increased in
dose with the most recent dose being 175mg po BID. Cyclosporine
goal trough is 150-200 and should next be checked on [**2192-9-2**] and
should be checked every 48 hrs.  Lab results should be faxed
every 48 hrs as soon as test results come back to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 638**] and to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 85488**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 85489**].  Along with these
you can fax CBC and chem 10 pls obtain as detailed on order
sheet. Pt started on standing magnesium given cyclosporine
results in magnesium wasting. Pt is also on predisone 40mg [**Hospital1 **].

Throughout admission pt continued to show evidence of red cell
and plt destruction on laboratory data (hgb/plts would drift
down, haptoglobin low, retics high). Initially numerous PRBC and
platelet transfusions were needed to stabilize pt while in the
ICU. Once he recovered enough to be on the floor, pt was
intermittently given PRBCs when his Hct was low enough that
there was concern for it causing symptoms. He only received plts
on the floor one time per IR before they pulled out the HD
catheter. He was followed closely by hematology while in the
hospital who recommend the following treatment for his HLH:

Unfortunately with HLH the patient's prognosis over the next
year is very poor.

# Sepsis/DIC: Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] presented with hypotension, elevated
WBC, elevated lactate, decreased haptoglobin, elevated PT/PTT,
and elevated fibrinogen. No clear infectious source, possible
liver or lung. Upon presentation pt was treated empirically with
meropenem, levofloxacin from HAP with GN coverage since pt had
been hospitalized and was on immunosuppression. He ultimately
completed a 14 day course of meropenem. Culture data was
ultimately all negative with the only positive micro test being
a low CMV VL. ID started pt on Gancyclovir for ppx, and initial
Acyclovir was stopped. Pt then suffered from neutropenia thought
possible related to Gancyclovir vs ATG. Repeat CMV VLs were
negative and Gancyclovir was stopped. Histo was negative so also
okay to stop Ambisome. Pt had been on bactrim as an outpatient
for PCP prophylaxis while on steroids, but this was changed to
atovaquone due patients liver injury and concerns for bactrim
involvement. Later in hospital course, pt was restarted on
acyclovir for prophylaxis while on the steroids. Repeat CMV VL
from [**2192-8-22**] was positive for 1,630 copies and he was restarted
on Valganciclovir 900 mg PO BID with a plan for 3 weeks of
treatment total after discharge. His CBC will need to be
monitored daily to look for neutropenia, but has remained stable
after 4 days of treatment.

# Respiratory failure: Electively intubated on [**7-30**] and
extubated on [**8-3**].  Post extubation maintained oxygen sats on
nasal cannula and then on room air. Throughout admission pt
continued to have cough, occasionally productive, and somewhat
congested chest, but no evidence of infection was found and pt
was not treated with Abx for PNA after initial presentation. Pt
has hx of asthma and was previously on Advair. So neb tx and
advair were given throughout hospitalization. Pt had CT of chest
for f/u of new poorly well-defined round opacities and right mid
and left lower lung, concerning for infection such as septic
emboli or fungal. CT scans shows areas of opacity overall
improving when compared to prior image in [**Month (only) 116**]. As per above, ID
added Atovaquone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] given that Bactrim can cause BM
suppression and liver damage.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Pt developed A-fib on [**8-1**] which
then resolved on [**8-4**]. This was likely related infection and
respiratory distress. He was started on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **], he
converted to sinus. Currently NSR. Metoprolol 25mg PO BID was
continued throughout admission although pt did not have any more
incidences of documented afib while on hospital.

# Elevated LFTs: Uncertain about etiology initially, but after
liver bx results were final the leading likelyhood is
cholestatic drug induced liver injury [**3-20**] to bactrim. Overall
improvement in LFT??????s, but t.bili was significantly elevated (38
at one point). Tbili slowly came down over course of the next
month although ALT and Alk phos remained stably somewhat
elevated. The LFT improvement that was noted initially dis seem
to correlate with ATG treatment.

# Anemia: Hemolyzing. Schistocytes previously seen on smear.
Hemophagocytosis seen in BM. Pt was intermittently transfused as
noted above when Hct would get around 21 or when there was
concern that pt was getting symptomatic from his anemia. Epogen
was given with HD while pt was on dialysis. Once dialysis was
discontinued, it was given MWF (4k units). As pt clinically
stabilized, he was kept in the hospital by the concern that he
continued to show evidence of red cell destruction.

# Thrombocytopenia: Pt required plt transfusions in the ICU as
initially his plts were low and somewhat labile. He was also
transfused for liver biopsy. Once the patient was stable enough
for the floor his plts ranged from 20k-80k. On the floor he was
transfused plts once when IR took out the HD cath, but otherwise
his transfusion parameter was set at spontaneous bleeding. The
exact etiology of the low plts was never completely clear but it
is likely multifactorial and related to HLH, medications, and
overall health.

# Neutropenia: Pt became neutropnic after 4 doses of ATG and 2
doses of Gancyclovir which may have caused BM suppression.
Counts quickly resolving after stopping offending meds. Once
count improved pt was given last dose of ATG. Gancyclovir was
kept off until [**8-24**] when a repeat CMV viral load was again
suddenly positive. Low dose gancyclovir was restarted and WBC
counts should be monitored daily.  Pt was then swtiched to
Galvancyclovir as per ID and his WBC have been monitored and
have been stable.  Will monitor his WBC while in [**Hospital 3782**] rehab to
watch for recurrence of the neutropenia

# Coagulopathy: Related to liver disease, infection, HLH. Pt did
not need FFP. Pt was given vit K x 3 days early in admission.
INR was stable around 1 for most of admission.

# Renal failure: Received CVVHx 3 days. This was stopped on
[**8-2**]. He then had microfiltration on the same day to help with
diureses for extubation.  He was started on HD [**8-4**]. Stayed on
HD until [**8-18**] with slow improvement of kidney function. After HD
was stopped, Cr was observed for a few days and when it
continued to show improvement down below 2, and pt continued to
make very good urine output, his HD line was pulled by IR on
[**8-23**]. Renal followed throughout course of disease and helped
manage electrolytes and guide HD therapy.

#Hyponatremia: Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] developed hyponatremia on [**2192-8-28**]
when he was autodiuresis after his kidney recovered from his
ARF. His hyponatremia and autodiuresis is likely also related to
poor glc control. He made up to 6.5L of urine 3 days prior to
discharge. PLEASE FLUID RESTRICT TO 2.5L daily as his sodium
improved with free water fluid restriction.

# Hypertension: Pt had elevated BP that was worse with ATG
infusion. He initially required Nitro drip for better BP
control. This was discontinued quickly once control was achieved
and he was restarted on his home dose of amlodipine 7.5mg which
was then increased dose to 10mg Qday. HD also helped with BP
control. Some additional control was provided by the metoprolol
on which the patient was kept to control Afib.

#Hyperglycemia: Pt not a diabetic, but glucose was elevated in
the setting of high dose steroids and tube feeds. Managed with
NPH of varying AM and PM doses with humalog ISS. Once tube feeds
were stopped and oral intake restarted he again had to adjust
NPH and ISS to keep sugars in an acceptable range. He is being
discharged on NPH and an ISS.

# Delerium: After patient was transferred to the floor from the
ICU he developed delirium over the first weekend which
manifested as inappropriate and sometimes violent actions with
pt attempting to hit staff and spitting on staff. Pt had to be
restrained with leather restraints for parts of two days because
he was able to break out of the soft restraints despite his
deconditioning. The first night this occurred pt had to be given
haloperidol and ativan. Psych was then involved in care and
recommended giving quitiapene QHs with extra prn doses as
needed. Pt was on this regimen, with slow tapering of the QHs
dose for the next two weeks, although delirium never again was
an issue. Pt was intermittently mildly depressed about his body
weakness and how long he had been in the hospital.
.
# Lung nodule: New poorly well-defined round opacities and right
mid and left lower lung, concerning for infection such as septic
emboli or fungal organisms. Chest CT  showed areas of opacity
overall improving when compared to prior image in [**Month (only) 116**] (when he
was previously admitted for what was thought to be TTP). This
was thought to be related to prior pulmonary hemorrhage that is
now resolving. Nodule will need follow-up as an outpatient after
discharge.

# HA: Early in admission, pt c/o bilateral frontal HA with no
focal neurological deficits found on exam, however this was a
new finding and given low platelet count this was concerning for
head bleed. Head CT showed no IC bleeding or other acute
process. HA resolved over next few days and was not an issue for
the rest of admission.

# Chest pain: pt had two episodes of epigastric pain which
raised concerns for chest pain. At each time EKGs were
unremarkable and cardiac enzymes did not show evidence of acute
MI (although troponin was stably elevated in context of renal
failure). Pt described pain as not unlike the GERD pain he
occasionally had in the past, and both times pain seemed to
resolve with a GI cocktail.

# Insomnia: He had difficulty with sleeping during his hospital
course and was started on trazodone qhs with good effect.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74316**] as you know you had a difficult hospital course but
we are very pleased that you are well enough now to go to rehab.
 You originally came in with low blood pressure, bleeding, renal
failure, liver failure, and hemolysis (destruction of your red
blood cells and platelets.  You required intubation in the
intensive care unit and transfusions of blood and platelets.
Your liver biopsy ultimately showed your liver problems were due
to a drug reaction, likely bactrim so you were changed from
bactrim to atovaquone. Your liver has been slowly recovering.
Your kidney function has improved and you no longer require
hemodialysis. You are urinating a lot as a result of your
improved renal function which caused your sodium levels to
decrease. This improved with getting IV fluids.

You had 2 bone marrow biopsies that ultimately diagnosed
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which as you know is a very
serious disease. You were originally treated with ATG and
steroids but later switched to cyclosporine.  Our hematologists
will give your rehab advice on how to continue treatment with
cyclosporine. You are also going to [**Hospital3 328**] on Monday for a
second opinion which we encourage you to do. You have this
appointment on [**2192-9-3**].

You currently have an infection called CMV which is being
treated with valgancyclovir which you will continue atleast
until [**2192-9-15**].

Sensory/Motor: actively and symmetrically withdraws all four
limbs away from noxious stimuli. Tone is increased in all four
limbs. Plantars are upgoing bilaterally.
Rest of the examination could not be performed.


Pertinent Results:
CT brain with and without contrast: Right frontal enhancing
lesion and two lesions in the left cerebellum, corresponding to
sites of known lesions as seen on MR [**8-18**]. No new lesions
identified. However, there is increased vasogenic edema in the
right frontal lobe. No significant mass effect seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro - Initially admitted to the [**Hospital 2571**] transferred to the step
down unit on [**9-25**] then to the floor on [**9-27**].  Mental status
improved.  On discharge neurologic exam - oriented to month/year
and only one day off on date, oriented to person and place.
Baseline very slight L hemiparesis but did have full strength
bilat FEs, IPs, and ankle dorsiflexion on am of discharge.

MRI showed 1.Acute left subdural hematoma, measuring up to 5 mm
in maximal thickness, layering over the left cerebral convexity
with very slight mass effect on
subjacent gyri and up to 4 mm rightward shift of the septum
pellucidum.
2. Minor acute subarachnoid hemorrhage at the bifrontovertex,
likely post-
traumatic.
3. No significant change in the right frontal metastatic lesion,
with larger
adjacent zone of vasogenic edema, particularly caudally.
4. Treated left cerebellar hemispheric metastases, unchanged,
with no new
lesion seen.
5. Stable dural enhancement, likely treatment-related.
6. Persistent fluid opacification of the mastoid air cells.

Very subtle subdural adn subarachnoid hemorrhages likely
traumatic from fall with seizures.

Treated with dexamethasone initially 4mg Q6hrs for increased
edema.  After discussion with neuro-oncology given tapered [**9-26**]
to 2mg Q6hrs, [**9-27**] to 2mg Q12 hrs for 1 day then off.

On [**9-26**] had some confusion and visual hallucinations (spiders
and ants), likely related to the steroids.  [**9-27**] hallucinations
resolved and did not recur.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluated during
admission, recommended a brief rehabilitation hospitalization
prior to going home.  Goal is definitely home for her.

FEN/GI - Speech and swallowing evaluated her, initially purree
diet with nectar thick liquids recommended on [**9-27**] advanced to
ground solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.
Electrolytes generally stable, gave one time replacement of
magnesium [**9-27**] for Mg 1.5 and started neutraphos 1 packet Qday
for phos of 2.4.  9/18 Mg 1.3, gave one more dose of mag oxide
800mg with plan to repeat electrolytes in rehab.  Increased
urine output [**2055-9-24**] then slowed down, likely diuresis from
fluids in the ICU.  Sodium remained within normal limits.

CV/Resp - Stable throughout.

ID - CXR with known mass, no evidence of pneumonia.  UA
negative.  No infectious concerns.

CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 86yo woman with dementia and h/o recent left MCA
stroke complicated by persistent aphasia and hemiparesis
admitted with acute hematocrit drop and guaiac positive stool.
.
# Anemia: Pt has chronic anemia w/ baseline Hct 25-27.
Hemolysis work-up was negative.  Acute drop in Hct was thought
to be from GI source.  Pt's Hct bumped appropriately with 2u RBC
transfusions, and she was monitored for 1 day in MICU, where she
remained hemodynamically stable.  GI was consulted, and given
her family's desire for minimal intervention, she was managed
conservatively with PPI, Hct checks, and PRN transfusions.  She
was also taken off ASA ppx for stroke, in setting of GIB.
Although labs do not show iron deficiency, she was supplemented
as she may continue to have GIB.  Her Hct remained stable at ~25
on day of discharge.  She should have her hematocrit checked on
the day after discharge.  Her hematocrit should be regularly
monitored afterwards according to her attending doctor's
discretion, but we would advise that another Hematocrit be
checked this [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**10-2**], and that she be transfused
as needed to keep her Hct at baseline ~ 25
.
# Hypernatremia:  Pt arrived with sodium of 153, which was
thought to be due to free water deficit from poor access to
water.  She was gently hydrated with D5W and her hypernatremia
resolved and has remained within normal range.
.
# Elevated troponin:  Patient unable to verbalize chest pain.
EKG does not show changes from prior tracing 3 weeks ago.  Her
troponin remained stable at 0.03 after 3 sets of enzymes.  She
was continued on home simvastatin.
.
# s/p Left MCA stroke: Continues to have significant aphasia and
right sided weakness.  Keppra was continued.  ASA was held in
setting of active bleed.
.
# HTN:  Remained HD stable throughout hospitalization with good
BP control.  Norvasc was held b/c of GI bleed, but discharge
instructions were to re-start her anti-hypertensive medications
at her long term care facility if she remained hemodynamically
stsable.
.
# h/o cataracts and glaucoma:  Pt was continued on levobunolol.
She was given xalatan eye drops instead of travatan due to
formulary issues.
.
# Heel ulcer: Stage 1 pressure ulcer was identified this
admission. The pt's legs were kept in waffle boots to minimize
pressure to this area.
.

Head CT:
preliminary read shows no acute process

Brief Hospital Course:
49M with h/o familial myoclonus, depression, EtOH abuse
transferred from HRI [**Location (un) **] for due to changes in mental
status.
.
#. acute mental status changes: Initially the pt was quite
agitated and confused, and was transferred to the ICU due to
demanding nursing care. He was placed in restraints and given 1x
5mg zyprexa and 2mg ativan IV for agitation. Broad differential
initially included infectious, ischemic, metabolic, toxic,
withdrawal symptoms, and psych. Likely not infectious - no
elevated WBC, no fever, UA negative, CXR negative. Likely not
ischemic - EKG normal, CT head negative. Ca, glucose, ammonia
normal. Pt was also not hypoxic. Hepatic encephalopathy was
unlikely as patient does not have ascites, no appreciable
asterixis. His TSH, B12, folate were all normal. Most likely
causes are EtOH withdrawal (EtOH on tox screen negative) with
concurrent Benzo intoxication (pos on tox screen and received
450mg librium over 4 days at HRI [**Location (un) **]), or depression with
psychosis. Psych was consulted and felt that benzo intoxication
was likely. There were no hemodynamic signs of withdrawal, pt
was placed on CIWA scale but did not require any benzos. He
improved with rest, IV fluids, and treatment with vitamins (MVI,
folate, thiamine, B vits). Upon discharge the pt was feeling
much better and was AOx3, cooperative, ambulatory, tolerating a
normal diet with stable vitals (never had any evidence of ETOH
withdrawal during his admission). We recommend to not treat the
patient with benzos as he is not withdrawing and to continue
monitoring and supportive care with nutrition, PT (ambulation),
and social work for long term support. Notably, he also has
allergies to haldol (unknown reaction) so this drug should be
avoided.
.
# Psych / familial myoclonus - psych service was consulted and
we held the pt's  vistaril, lexapro, inderal and topamax.
Psychiatry recommended to hold his psych meds until further
outpatient evaluation.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - Pt has low platelet count of 102, which is
likely secondary to chronic EtOH use. We continued to monitor
and upon discharge the pt's Plt count was improved to 171.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted due to changes in your mental status which was
thought to be either due to depression with psychosis or alcohol
intoxication compounded by intoxication with librium given at
your rehab center. You were initially quite agitated and we had
to transfer you to the ICU for monitoring. You were worked up
for other potential causes of your mental status changes but
they were negative. You did not have any signs of alcohol
withdrawal. In the ICU you were given some medicine to lower
your agitation and calm you. Once you were more stable and less
agitated you were transferred to the medical floor where you had
improved mental status. You were cooperative and were able to
ambulate, use the bathroom normally, and tolerate a normal diet.
You were given vitamins and IV fluids during the time that you
improved.
.
You will be discharged with new medicines: thiamine 100mg daily,
multivitamin daily, vitamin B complex 1 tab daily, folic acid

Brief Hospital Course:
87yo woman with history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, presenting with diaphoresis, melana, and found to
have upper GI bleed.  During her hospitalization, the following
problems were addressed:.
#.  GI bleed:  Patient was initially admitted to the ICU and
transfused three units PRBC.  Emergent EGD was done in the MICU
showing an ulcer at the GE junction, but it was too obscured by
blood for further investigation.  She was monitored overnight in
the MICU and then transferred to the floor.  She underwent
repeat EGD which showed two distal esophageal ulcers.  It was
later noted that the patient had been taking only a minimal
amount of water with her weekly Fosamax, and this was thought to
be the cause.  Fosamax was held until further discussion with
the patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], can be had.
Aspirin and Plavis were also held, and she was treated with big
iv Protonix.  Hct stabilized, and her diet was advanced.  She
was discharged to home on Prevacid 30mg [**Hospital1 **], liquid formula. She
will resume taking Plavix 75mg daily on [**2180-4-19**].  She was
instructed to resume Aspirin 81mg daily 4 weeks after discharge.
 She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to review her hospital
course On [**2180-4-18**].  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
repeat endoscopy [**2180-6-8**], 8 weeks after initial
evaluation.
#.  Leg twitching:  On day two of her hospitalization the
patient began complaining of bilateral leg twitching.  A
neurology consult was called and found her exam to be consistent
with myoclonus due to metabolic insult.  Specifically they felt
the elevated urea level after her GI bleed likely resulted in
the muscle spasms.  Other sources of metabolic insult were
evaluated including tests for thyroid function, and were
nondiagnostic.  The neurology services believed it would resolve
spontaneously with clearance of the urea.  The remainder of her
neurologic exam was within normal limits.
#.  CAD:  There were no acute issues.  She was ruled out for
acute MI and continued on her outpatient regimen of captopril,
carvedilol, and statin for secondary prevention.  Plavix will be
restarted [**2180-4-19**], aspirin 4weeks after discharge..
#.  CRI:  Baseline creatinine 1.0-1.1, and was elevated as high
as 1.3 during her hospitalization.  It was thought to be
prerenal in etiology and treated with gentle iv fluids.
#.  Hypothyroid:  continued Synthroid per outpatient regimen.  A
TSH was checked and was mildly elevated at 4.4; however, free T4
was within normal limits at 1.6.
#.  Psych:  continued citalopram, trazadone per outpatient
regimen
#.  Osteoporosis:  We discontinued weekly Fosamax out of concern
that this was related to the developed of GE ulcers.  The
patient was instructed to discuss resuming Fosamax with her
primary care physician.
#.  Dispo:  The patient was discharged to home.  She has full
time home health aides.  Health care proxy is her daughter [**Name (NI) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 94693**].  She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**2180-4-18**].

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2170-10-9**] 2:21 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-8**], there has been
placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3
cm above the carina. Left subclavian catheter extends to the
mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Patchy areas of opacification
again seen, especially in the right upper zone.  Haziness of the
left and also probably right bases could reflect free pleural
fluid.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2170-10-10**] at 10:46:11 AM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
60-70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old [**Location 7972**] man with active
tuberculosis (on INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide), HIV (last CD4
count 156 on [**2170-9-20**]) who was recently evaluated for epigastric
abdominal pain and was found to have a CT demonstrating
mediastinal, mesenteric, and pelvic nodal masses compatible with
high-grade lymphoma.
.
# Abdominal Pain/Lymphadenopathy:  Pt presented with diffuse and
achy abdominal pain, which he had for the preceding month. He
went to the infectious disease clinic, where he had been
followed for his tuberculosis and HIV. A CT torso was performed
on [**2170-10-5**], with preliminary read showing multiple masses
suggestive of lymphoma. He was referred to the ED for
evaluation; his LDH was 1095 and uric acid 22.6. He was admitted
to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] hospitalists and rapidly transferred to the
BMT service for further management.  A bone marrow biopsy was
obtained surgery was emergently consulted for to obtain tissue.
The patiet underwent a mini ex-lap and axillary lymphnode
disection for biopsy.  Both bone marrow and abdominal lymphnode
biopsies demonstrated plasmablastic lymphoma.  The patient was
started on [**Hospital1 **] and tolerated the treatment well.  He was
discharged with instructions to follow-up with the hematology
clinic.
.
# Tumor lysis syndrome/methemoglobinemia: The patient was
admitted with concern- Check tumor lysis.  The renal team was
consulted on [**10-8**] for spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome, with
specific question of prophylactic hemodialysis, and recommended
rasburicase to decrease serum uric acid. Allopurinol was
continued.
On [**10-8**] in the evening, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7600**] for hypoxia with
desaturations to the 80's. He was given Lasix 20mg x 2 with
minimal improvement and was transferred to the ICU.  A
discrepancy was noted between his oxygen saturations and PaO2 on
ABG. Methemoglobin level was noted to be elevated at 10%.
Rasburicase was held given its known association with
methemoglobinemia.
.
# Tuberculosis/Eosinophilia/HIV: Infectious disease was
consulted for help with management of tuberculosis, HIV, and
possible parasitic infection given elevated eosinophilia; they
recommended continuing treatment for tuberculosis and treating
for possible parasitic infection with ivermectin x 2.
Charcot-[**Location (un) 5244**] crystals were seen in the stool, which was
thought to be secondary to successful treatment of intestinal
parasites.  The patient was continued on TB therapy with INH,
PZA, rifabutin.  Sputum from [**9-27**] had been positive for minimal
AFB, concerning for either profound immunosuppression,
noncompliance, and/or MDR TB.  MTD testing was negative for M.
Tuberculosis on [**10-3**].  The patient was continued on TB therapy.
Induced sputum samples from [**10-10**] and [**10-12**] were negative for AFB
on gram stain.  Repeat cultures were obtained on [**10-15**] and were
pending at the time of discharge.
Regarding the patient's HIV, the patient was ARV naive.  His
last CD 4 156 with VL 489,000.  Due to the need for
chemotherapy, it was felt that ARV therapy should be postponed.
Upon discharge, the patient was scheduled for follow-up with the
ID. clinic.
.
# Thrush: Several days following his inital chemotherapy
treatment, the patient was noted to have the [**Last Name (un) **] appearance of
oral thrush.   He was started on nystatin with instructions to
complete an outpatient treatment course.
.
# Inguinal Hernia:  Pt complained of intermittant abdominal pain
when standing or coughing.  On further exam, the patient was
note to have bilateral inguninal herias.  Surgery was consulted
for concer for infarction.  However, bith inguinal hernias were
reduced without difficulty.  No further interventions were
taken.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.8, BP 104/60, heart rate 56, respiratory rate 16,
saturations 98% on room air.  General:  The patient was
awake, alert, oriented times three, fluent speech, good
comprehension, able to name months of the year backwards.
Her cranial nerves were intact.  HEENT:  She did have some
uvular deviation to the left.  Mild left facial asymmetry
with no evidence of excursion.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  She did have weakness in the left upper
extremity as well as left lower extremity.  She had 4+ of the
deltoids, biceps, triceps, wrist extension, and wrist flexion
on the left side as well as [**3-10**]- in the IPs, quads, and
hamstrings.  She was 5 in the [**Last Name (un) 938**], AT and plantar flexion on
the left.  On the right side, she was [**4-10**] in the muscle
groups in the right upper extremity and [**3-10**]- in the right
upper extremity.  Her reflexes were 3+ throughout.  Her toes
were upgoing.  She did have some spasticity but a negative
[**Doctor Last Name **].  Her sensation was intact to light touch throughout.
Her coordination was slightly slow on the left side and her
proprioception was decreased on the left side.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  She had a head CT which showed
evidence of a right frontal parasagittal lesion which arises
from the corpus callosum and infiltrating in the left frontal
lobe.

HOSPITAL COURSE: On [**2186-7-18**], the patient was taken
to the OR for a right frontal craniotomy for excision of
tumor without intraoperative complications.  The patient was
monitored in the Recovery Room overnight.  She was awake,
alert, and oriented times three, following commands, had some
continued left facial droop, continued left-sided weakness.
She was a [**2-8**] in all muscle groups in the upper extremities
and lower extremities on the left side.  The pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Her EOMs were full.
She did have some periods of severe agitation and
hallucinating on the first night postoperatively.

She was medicated with Haldol and Ativan.  She was
transferred to the ICU on postoperative day number one due to
drain placement.  On [**2186-7-19**], she was seen by the Psychiatry
Service due to the severe psychosis while in the ICU.
Psychiatry assessment found the patient delirious and given
the acute onset following craniotomy as well as
disorientation, psychotic beliefs about Satan, there are
obviously concerns.  They suggested holding Wellbutrin and
Ativan and minimizing narcotic use and starting Haldol 2 mg
IV t.i.d. and p.r.n. for agitation.

The patient was also started on lithium 300 mg p.o. b.i.d.
and concurrently is on Haldol 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Psychiatry
continued to follow the patient throughout her hospital stay.
Her delirium resolved and her mood was stable on lithium and
Haldol.  Her vital signs remained stable.  She was
transferred to the regular floor on [**2186-7-22**] after her vent
drain was discontinued.  Her vital signs have remained stable
throughout her hospital stay.

She was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and
felt to be safe for discharge home.  She has been weaned down
on her steroid medication.  She will be weaned down to 2 mg
p.o. b.i.d. over the course of a weeks time and follow-up in
the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic on [**2186-8-14**].  She will return
to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] V on postoperative day number ten for staple removal.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.

IMAGING:
- [**2172-9-22**] ECHO: FOCUSED STUDY: Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small
to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen. No
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade physiology. Compared
with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2171-11-6**], the pericardial effusion is new. Left ventricular
function appears less vigorous. The severity of mitral
regurgitation is increased.
.
[**2172-9-22**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Portable semi-upright chest
radiograph demonstrates an interval increase in right basilar
opacity, which likely represents a component of pleural
effusion. Superimposed atelectasis and/or consolidation is not
excluded. The heart size is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal
contours are notable only for calcification of the aortic arch.
The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
.
[**2172-9-22**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST:
LUNG BASES: Granulomata are seen within the lungs bilaterally.
There is a
large right and small left pleural effusion with a density of
simple fluid.  Compressive atelectasis is seen at the right
greater than left lower lobes.  There is a moderate-sized
pericardial effusion, with the attenuation of slightly complex
fluid ([**Doctor Last Name **] 15-30). There is coronary arterial calcification, and
the heart is moderately enlarged.
ABDOMEN: Evaluation of the abdominal viscera is limited by lack
of
intravenous contrast. The liver is grossly unremarkable, without
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The spleen is normal
appearing with note made of marked splenic arterial
calcification. The adrenals are normal bilaterally.  The
pancreas demonstrates coarse calcification as noted previously,
consistent with diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, with atrophy
of the distal body and tail. Within the body of the pancreas,
there is a 1.8 cm ovoid soft tissue focus which is more dense
than the surrounding gland and is stable compared with multiple
priors. A calcification is seen within the wall of the
gallbladder which was not seen on the prior which is likely a
non-dependent or adherent stone. The gallbladder is otherwise
unremarkable. The kidneys are atrophic and there is perinephric
stranding. There is no hydronephrosis and there are no stones,
though note is made of diffuse vascular calcification.
Paraesophageal lymphadenopathy is noted, increased in size
compared with
prior, and likely reactive. The stomach is collapsed and not
well evaluated.  Loops of small bowel are normal in caliber and
enhancement. There is fecalization of distal loops of ileum.
There is a moderate amount of abdominal ascites. There is no
intraperitoneal free air. The aorta is
calcified along its course, though normal in caliber. There is a
small
fluid-filled periumbilical hernia. There is no retroperitoneal
hematoma.
There is a fluid-filled left inguinal hernia. There is diffuse
body wall
stranding compatible with anasarca.
PELVIS: The bladder is normal appearing. The prostate and
seminal vesicles
are unremarkable. The rectum is normal. The [**Doctor Last Name 499**] is normal. The
appendix
is normal. There is haziness of the central mesentery and
retroperitoneum,
which is likely resulting from similar process from the
patient's ascites.
BONE WINDOWS: There is multilevel degenerative change of the
thoracolumbar
spine, but no concerning lytic or blastic osseous lesions.
.
[**2172-9-23**] ECHO (TTE): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pericardial effusion with no echo signs of
tamponade. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Mild pulmonary
hypertrension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-11-6**],
the pericardial effusion is new. Left ventricular function is
now mildly depressed. Estimated pulmonary artery pressures are
similar.
.
[**2172-9-23**] ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY):  Study is technically
limited. The liver is grossly normal without focal lesion or
intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Moderate
volume ascites is noted. The gallbladder is minimally distended
without wall thickening or edema. There may be a small tiny
adherent stone. The common bile duct is not dilated measuring 3
mm. Pancreas and aorta are not well seen due to overlying bowel
gas. The imaged IVC is unremarkable. The spleen is top normal in
size measuring 12.1 cm. There is no hydronephrosis, stone or
mass bilaterally with the right kidney measuring 10.7 cm and the
left kidney
measuring 10.8 cm.

Pericardial fluid:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

MRI Head
. Multiple punctate foci of restricted diffusion in the left
cerebellar
hemisphere which represent small acute infarcts in the left
posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory. These are likely
of embolic or hypoxic etiology. MRA was not performed but major
flow voids are grossly patent.

TTE [**10-12**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is a very small circumferential
pericardial effusion without RA or RV diastolic collapse. There
are very prominent left pleural and right pleural effusions as
well as ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
79M with CAD, diastolic CHF (EF 50-55%), afib on Coumadin
admitted with volume overload in setting of N/V at home x 3
days, found to have INR 19 with no bleeding complications and
moderate pericardial effusion with no tamponade physiology
transferred to CCU for hypotension in setting of diuresis. He
was stabilized and went to the floor. On the floor, the patient
was unwilling to participate in most aspects of care. He took
off his telemetry leads, then was found unresponsive by a nurse
and was found to be in PEA arrest, likely secondary to cardiac
tamonade. There was a prolonged amount of time without a pulse.
He was taken back to the CCU, where he underwent intubation and
cooling protocol. Off of sedation, there was evidence of
extensive neurologic damage, and a poor functional recovery was
expected. Because of underlying kidney failure and uremia, he
received hemodialysis to achieve a BUN less than upon admission
(when he was mentating well). Because of poor renal clearance,
serum benzos remained positive. He was given flumazenil to
reverse any effect they may be having, and there was a minimal
response. Ethics was involved and after extensive discussion
with all available contacts, it was decided to make the patient
CMO. The patient expired several hours later on [**2172-10-13**].

CXR:
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to
previous
exam from [**2113-3-14**]. Compared to prior, there is new
central pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild cephalization
of the pulmonary vasculature.  There is no confluent
consolidation or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable, as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular
congestion without frank pulmonary edema.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Thickened bladder wall with surrounding stranding potentially
secondary to cystitis and correlation with UA suggested.
2. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. Hypodense lesions in each kidney likely represent cysts,
however, not
fully characterized on nonenhanced CT scan. If desired US could
help
characterize.
4. Enlarged prostate.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yom with history of a.fib, on pradaxa, now presenting with
worsening BRBPR and hematuria
.
# GI Bleed: Patient was monitored in the MICU overnight for GIB
given pradaxa use.  He remained normotensive throughout his MICU
stay without drop in Hct.  He was evaluated by GI who felt no
urgent colonoscopy was needed, and symptoms were likely
secondary hemorrhoidal and exacerbated by anticoagulation.  He
was transferred to the medical floor where he remained stable
o/n.  After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the patient's out- patient
cardiologist, given the fact that he has been in sinus for the
better part of a year and has not flipped into AFIB he was d/c'd
on full dose ASA with GI f/u scheduled.
.
# UTI: Patient was started on ciprofloxacin for UTI as evidenced
by UA and dysuria.  He was subsequently switched to cefpodoxime
given concern for prolonged QTc in combination with amiodarone.
Micro showed a sensitive E. Coli.
.
# Afib: Patient remained in sinus rhythm.  Anticoagulation was
initially held, then switched to ASA as above.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine was 2.0 on admission, improving to 1.2 the
following day and 1.0 on the day of discharge.  Thought to be
secondary to volume depletion.

# Wheezing: Patine twas initially slightly wheezy on exam
thoguht to be sedcondary to mild volume overload.  The following
day pulmonary exam had improved, patient was comfortable on room
air.  He refused scripts for inhalers at home, saying he only
needs them when he is sick.

.
# Hypertension: Home medications initially held in the MICU,
were restarted after patient demonstrated hemodynamic stability
and transferred to the floor.  Did well from this standpoint
until discharge.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 44 yo female with PMHx of allergic fungal
sinusitis, who presents from OSH with obstructed kidney stone.
Pt, who has no history of stones, says that Friday [**2185-9-9**] she
started to have pain on the right side. She is unable to

Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress, slurred speech

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19017**] is a 69-year-old male with past medical history
significant for severe COPD on home oxygen at 4L, HTN, GERD, CAD
(prior NSTEMI), hyperlipidemia, h/o resistant pseudomonas PNA
and chronic back pain who was brought to ED via EMS after wife
noticed he had worse confusion and altered mentation this
evening. Patient denies recent cough, fevers, chills or
increased/discolored sputum production. Of note, he had recent
ED visit on [**4-5**] for worse weakness and depression and was seen
by psychiatry and SW and discharged home. Much of history
collected from wife given patient's AMS.

In ED a fentanyl patch was noticed on his back and he was having
some slurred speech so there was concern for narcotic induced
hypercarbia after initial ABG showed pH 7.28, pCO2 116, pO2 56,
HCO3 57. He is also taking Ativan and Percocet at home regularly
for anxiety and low back pain. He complained of some generalized
weakness along with 1 week of more focal right hand weakness.
Therefore, neurology was called to evaluate him in ED and his
exam was non-focal. A CT head was done which was unremarkable.
Neuro recommended CTA head and neck.  There was also concern for
COPD flare up from possible infection as well but CXR was
unremarkable for PNA.

Initial vitals in ED were: T98.2F, HR 93, BP 137/77, RR 28 and
O2 Saturation 99% on 6L. He was given albuterol nebs,
ipratropium nebs, 125mg IV Solumedrol, 1g IV Ceftriaxone, 500mg
IV Azithromycin and Naloxone .4mg x1 for presumed narcotic
induced respiratory distress. He became quite agitated after
Naloxone so he was given 2.5mg IV Haldol. Lactate was normal at
0.8 and he also had hyperkalemia to 5.4 range. WBC count was
normal at 8.6 and Hct near baseline at 37.2. FSG was 184. Repeat
ABG much improved s/p BIPAP with pH 7.36, pCO2
85, pO2 65, HCO3 50.

On evaluation in the MICU, he appeared confused, somewhat
agitated and was not cooperative with initial questions but then
calmed down within minutes and was able to give a limited
history. Speech somewhat garbled at baseline and patient was
only oriented to place and year but did not know month or why
exactly he was in ICU.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI. Limited ROS otherwise due to
patient's AMS. Patient also endorses decreased appetite and wife
also corroborates poor PO intake x 1 week.

Past Medical History:
1. Severe COPD on 4 L O2 at home
2. History of VRE UTI
3. History of MRSA
4. CAD w/ NSTEMI ([**2101**]) (last cath in [**4-/2103**] w/o abnormalities.

5. Steroid induced hyperglycemia
6. Hypertension
7. Hyperlipidemia
8. Chronic low back pain after L1-2 laminectomy
9. Bilateral shoulder pain
10. Cataracts bilaterally - s/p surgery for both
11. GERD
12. BPH
13. History of resistant Pseduomonas PNA

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 686**] with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] was born in [**Country 7936**].

=================================
IMAGING:

CXR ([**2108-4-17**]) - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous
radiograph, there is no evidence of newly appeared focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged
hyperinflation of both lungs, the right lung base is better
ventilated than on the previous examination. No pleural
effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Moderate
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.

CXR ([**2108-4-15**]) -  IMPRESSION: COPD. No definite signs of
pneumonia. If needed, correlation with a lateral view may aid.

CT Head ([**2108-4-15**]) - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
69-year-old male with severe COPD on home 4L NC, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, CAD, GERD, depression and chronic back pain on
multiple sedating pain medications and psychiatric medications
who presented with AMS, hypercarbic respiratory distress.

# Severe COPD & Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: Initial
desaturations and hypercarbia was felt to be related to
narcotic- and benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression. He
is also a CO2-retainer at baseline. Patient had been taking
fentanyl patches, percocet, and ativan at home. The patient had
cultures with no growth, was afebrile, and had a clear CXR,
making infection less likely. Moreover, he had no sputum changes
or worse cough from usual baseline. He was initially treated as
a COPD exacerbation with albuterol/ipratropium nebs, solumedrol,
ceftriaxone, azithromycin. Ceftriaxone was ultimately stopped,
and steroids were switched to oral prednisone. He was continued
on a 5-day course of azithromycin. While he was in the MICU,
meetings were held with the patient, his family, and the
palliative care team. Given his advanced end stage COPD status
and his wished to focus on his comfort, the patient was made CMO
(comfort measures only). He was given the option of BiPAP to
help with his breathing but did not like the way the BiPAP mask
felt. Given his CMO status, his medication regimen was adjusted
(see below). He was discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**], with plans for eventual
transition to hospice.

# Altered Mental Status: As above, felt to be secondary to
hypercarbia and narcotics. CT head negative for any acute
process. Mental status improved over the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course. Pt was started on haloperidol and clonopin to help with
anxiety and agitation. Pt's ativan was also increased from
nightly PRN to q6hours PRN.

# Coronary Artery Disease: Past medical history significant for
prior NSTEMI in [**2101**]. On admission, he had no complaints of
current chest pain or palpitations. After decision was made for
comfort care, many of his cardiac medications were stopped,
including lisinopril, pravastatin, and aspirin.

# Chronic Back Pain: Given concern for decreased respirations
and somnolence with hypercarbia, sedating narcotics were held on
admission. He was started on [**Year (4 digits) 1988**] tylenol as well as
lidoderm patches for pain control. At the time of discharge, the
patient was not complaining of any pain.

# Goals of Care: While the patient was in the ICU, meeting was
held between the patient, his family, the ICU team, and the
palliative care team. The decision was made to transition to
comfort care. Many non-essential medications were stopped at
that time (see medications section below). At discharge, he was
started on morphine elixir for shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**]. He was also
started on haldol and klonopin for anxiety, as described above.
He was discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**], with plans for eventual transition
to hospice.

Service:  MEDICINE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 28912**] is a 27-year-old HIV
positive male who presented with fevers, chills, headache to
the Emergency Room.  The patient was in his usual state of
health until last week while being on vacation in [**Location (un) 28913**].  He developed throbbing frontal occipital headache
eyes and dry mouth and the headache was alleviated only
slightly with ibuprofen.  About one day later, the patient
developed diffuse myalgia, began having shaking chills, and
noted an intense erythema over both legs and injected
conjunctivae and sclerae.  These symptoms persisted over
three days and patient returned from vacation.  At home, he
noted a temperature of 103.9 and came to the Emergency

On review of systems, the patient had not had any headache as
above before, is not photophobic, but does complain of a
stiff neck.  He did not have any visual disturbances,
photophobia, nasal congestion, sore throat, oral ulcers or
odynophagia.  He does complain of mild shortness of breath
over several months but is unable to quantify this in more
detail and shortness of breath did not limit him in daily
activities.  He does complain of a cough.  He is not
complaining of nausea or vomiting, chronic fevers.  He does
complain of tarry loose stools, twice to three times per day,
otherwise, has no urinary symptoms.  He cannot recall any
exposure to wild plants and animals or travels to exotic
rural settings.  He does not recall when his last PPD was
done.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   HIV was diagnosed in [**2171-2-25**].
Until then, he had a stable CD4 count in the mid 300s and
never had any opportunistic infections or AIDS defining
illnesses until now.  He was in no previous HAART.  Two weeks
ago, CD4 count was 171, his viral load 200,000 and was
started on Bactrim for Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis.
2.  Status post auricle cyst excision.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Bactrim, acyclovir.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a single homosexual young man
who at the moment has no current partners and is not sexually
active.  He denies alcohol or intravenous drug abuse.  He is
employed as a coordinator for a program for the Pediatric
Justice Department, working with HIV positive kids.  He is
also a part-time veterinarian technician.  Recently, his
travel history included a stay in [**Location (un) 5953**] last week and
a stay in D.C. last month, Phoenix last year.  At home, he
has three cats.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature was 99.6.  Blood
pressure 116/62. Pulse 93.  Respiratory rate 19.  02
saturation on room air 98%.  In general, he is an awake,
alert and oriented young man, looks slightly uncomfortable
and is coughing.  His pupils are equally round and reactive
to light.  He has some conjunctival and scleral injection on
both eyes.  No oral lesions.  His neck exam reveals post
cervical tender lymphadenopathy and supple meningismus.
Auscultation of his heart revealed regular rate and rhythm,
no murmurs, gallops or friction rubs. Auscultation of the
lungs reveals scattered inspiratory crackles in the right
post mid lung field.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended and only shows slight right upper quadrant
tenderness on deep palpation.  Bowel sounds are normal active
over all four quadrants.  There is no edema and his
extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing.  The skin on his
back and on both legs proximally shows a diffuse erythema
with no open ulcerations, no desquamations and no petechial
purpura like appearance.  On neurological exam, he is alert
and oriented times four.  Muscle strength 5/5 throughout.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 2.3,
hematocrit 37, platelet count 133,000.  Differential is 57
polymorphonucleocytes, 35 lymphocytes, 6 monocytes, 1
eosinophil.  MCV is 85, sodium 136, potassium 3.4, chloride
102, HCO3 25, BUN 9, creatinine 0.9, glucose 92.

COURSE OF HOSPITAL STAY:  To rule out meningitis, a head CT
was performed showing no acute intracranial process.  A
lumbar puncture revealed 2 white blood cells, no red blood
cells, protein of 31, glucose of 53 in cerebrospinal fluid.
Because of his shortness of breath and to rule out pneumonia
as the source of his symptoms, a chest x-ray was performed
showing no cardiopulmonary process.  The next day, his cough
increased as well as his shortness of breath, and he became
hypoxic.  His 02 saturation dropped to 85% on five liters.
Another chest x-ray was done showing now an acute
interstitial and valvular pulmonary edema.  The heart size
now was borderline with diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema.
Predominantly perihilar air space opacities and small
bilateral pleural effusions.  Induced sputums were performed
and the patient was started on intravenous Bactrim and
prednisone for a possible PCP infection and levofloxacin for
any community-acquired pneumonia.  An echocardiogram was also
performed showing an ejection fraction of over 65% with
normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
systolic function.

As the patient continued to worsen and became increasingly
hypoxic, he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit on day two of his hospital stay.  Blood cultures, urine
cultures, stool cultures were obtained, but were all
negative.  The patient was also feeling increasingly anxious
and was given morphine, pantoprazole, zolpidem, and heparin.
On day three of his hospital stay, the patient had to be
intubated due to increasing hypoxia and respiratory distress.
Another chest x-ray now showed a worsening in aeration.  The
previously noted pulmonary edema, which had predominated in
the central lung zone, appeared to have extended into more
peripheral portions of both hemithoraces.  It was consistent
with adult respiratory distress syndrome and possibly
superimposed pneumonia.  The patient was sedated through
Fentanyl, lorazepam and also received nicotine.

On day five of his hospital stay, hematocrit dropped to 26.7.
He had not stooled and laboratory findings were not
significant for hemolysis; therefore, an abdominal CT scan
was performed to rule out retroperitoneal bleeding.  The CT
showed evidence of bilateral pneumonia aspiration, mild
pleural effusions, but no focal consolidations and no
retroperitoneal bleeding.  To identify the source of his
infection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed but viral
culture was negative.  Influenza antigens A and B were
negative.  Respiratory syncytial virus [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was negative.
No acid fast bacillus in the smear was detected.  No
polymorphonuclears and sparse oropharyngeal flora could be
seen.  Fungal culture was negative.  Legionella culture was
negative and PCP was negative.  The sputum showed only sparse
oropharyngeal growth.  Cerebrospinal fluid culture was
negative for cryptococcal antigen fungus.  The HIV viral load
was 343.  Serology was as follows:  EBV:  VCA, IgG antibody
positive.  EBNA IgG antibody negative.  VCA, IgM antibody
negative.  Toxoplasma IgG antibody equivocal.  CMV IgG
antibody 385 AU/ml. Hepatitis A antibody negative. IgG
indeterminate, IgM negative, IgA negative.  HBS antigen
negative.  HBS antibody positive.  HBV antibody negative.
HCV antibody negative.  HIV antibody positive.

Stool cultures showed no ova or parasites. No
Cryptosporidium, no Giardia, no polymorphonucleocytes.  C.
difficile was repeatedly negative.  As Bactrim has been
described to be associated with adult respiratory distress
syndrome, Bactrim was discontinued on day five of hospital
stay.  Within the next three days, the patient improved,
still had fevers, but could be put on a spontaneous breathing
ventilator on day eight of his hospital stay and extubated on
day nine.  The skin signs markedly improved and his 02
saturation on hospital day nine was now 98% on four liters of
oxygen/nasal cannula.

On day ten of his hospital stay, the patient developed
withdrawal symptoms consisting of agitation, hallucinations
and tachypnea, which could be attributed to the high doses of
Fentanyl he had received.

The patient was transferred to the Medicine Floor on day ten
of his hospital stay.  A chest x-ray showed no significant
changes to previous ones.  The patient remained to be anxious
and agitated.  He also still had hallucinations and an oral
thrush could be observed and treated with Nystatin.  He
continued to have diarrhea, but his stool cultures remained
negative.  Blood cultures were drawn and were still pending.
On day 12 of his hospital stay, the patient was started on
Dapsone for PCP prophylaxis, but the patient developed a rash
on both arms and the back again.  As Dapsone is known to show
a cross reactivity to Bactrim in [**10-20**]%, Dapsone was
discontinued.  Patient continued to have fevers and further
blood cultures were drawn which are still pending.

On day 14 of his hospital stay, all medications except
prednisone and the nicotine patch were discontinued.  The
patient was seen by Physical Therapy and started to walk
around the floor.  Diarrhea seemed to have gotten better.
His temperatures remained at low grade.  On day 15 of his
hospital stay, the patient was discharged.  Blood cultures
will have to be followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], with whom he
has an appointment within two weeks and a Infectious Disease
Consult for starting of HAART and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  His
medications on discharge are Nystatin and nicotine patches.

History of Present Illness:
77M history of schizophrenia, neurogenic bladder presenting from
NH with ACS with resuscitation at [**Hospital1 2177**] 1 month ptp, brought in by
EMS due to hypoxia, concern for PNA at nursing home. The patient
is schizophrenic per history and is unable to provide a history
of his own.  Per discussion with the floor nurse from his
nursing home, a CXR was obtained 4 days prior to admission for a
cough that was consistent with a pneumonia.  He was started on a
Z-pack.  One day prior to admission, he developed tachypnea and
started to desaturated in the the low 80's.  EMS were call and
he was stat low 90's on a NRB.  He was brought in by Ambulance.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CT ANGIO CHEST [**2185-6-24**] -
TECHNIQUE:  CTA of the chest was performed per department
protocol.  Oblique sagittal and coronal reformats were available
for review along with the axial images.
CT OF THE CHEST:  There are small pulmonary arterial filling
defects in the subsegmental bronchi supplying the lingula (4:71)
as well as additional filling defect in the subsegmental right
lower lobe bronchi (4:87).  An additional area of segmental
pulmonary embolus is seen in the apical segment of the right
upper lobe (4:33).  There is no evidence of right heart strain.
Within the right middle and upper lobe there are extensive
nodular opacities as well as several more gound glass appearing
areas of opacity (4:61 and 4:27).  There is extensive
atelectasis of the right lower lobe (4.83) with relative
[**Name (NI) 71062**] peripheral area within the collapsed lung.  No
definitive arterial supply with embolus is seen in this area;
however in the setting of other emboli and configuration of this
finding, it is concerning for infarct.  There is no pleural or
pericardial effusion.  In the left hemithorax, there is a large
hiatal hernia with stomach and GE junction above the diaphragm.
This causes compressive atelectasis (4:102) on the adjacent
lung. The patient is intubated with endotracheal tube
terminating approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An nasogastric
tube is seen in the esophagus but does not reach the GE junction
or the stomach. Subdiaphgramatically, gallstones are seen. The
aorta and the great vessels appear unremarkable. No suspicious
lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen within the bones.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right middle and upper lobe nodular opacities as well as
several areas of ground-glass opacity consistent with infectious
process.
2.  Bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and subsegmental
levels with no evidence of right heart strain. There is an area
of hypoenhancement within the atelctatic right lower lobe along
the periphery concerning for infarction.
3.  Complete right lower lobe atelectasis.
4.  Large diaphgramatic hernia.
5.  Cholelithasis.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND [**2185-6-24**] -
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of the left common femoral, left
superficial femoral, left popliteal vein show normal
compressibility, flow and augmentation.  Note is made of
duplicated left superficial femoral veins. The left calf veins
show normal flow. Grayscale, color, and spectral Doppler
examination of the right common femoral vein shows normal
compressibility and flow.   Note is made of duplicated right
superficial femoral veins. There is partially occlusive thrombus
noted within
one of the right proximal superficial femoral veins which is of
unclear
chronicity.  The distal superficial femoral vein, the entire
length of the
other superficial femoral vein,  popliteal vein appear patent.
The right
posterior tibial veins were patent.  The right peroneal veins
were not
visualized.

IMPRESSION:
1. Partially occlusive thrombus noted within one of the two
right proximal
superficial femoral veins which is of unclear chronicity. Right
peroneal veins were not visualized.
2. No DVT in left lower extremity.

ECHO [**2185-6-24**] -
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Conclusions
Technically suboptimal study.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). No definate aortic regurfgitation is seen. The
mitral leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a very prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2185-6-26**]
Compared with [**2185-6-25**] at 5:46 a.m., an NG tube is again noted.
It overlies the lower chest, but appears to overlie the gastric
fundus, which is elevated due to a diaphragmatic herniation, as
seen on [**2185-6-24**] CT scan.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view
could help to confirm this. Again noted is ET tube in
satisfactory position above the carina. Prominence
of right paratracheal soft tissues is noted, but may be
accentuated due to
patient rotation.  There is focal opacity in the right upper
zone and patchy opacity in the right lower zone medially.  These
findings are better depicted on [**2185-6-24**] CT scan.  The lung apices
are excluded from the film. Electronic battery pack is noted
overlying left iliac crest.

CXR [**2185-7-6**]
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-5**], the orogastric
tube has been
removed.  Other monitoring and support devices remain in place.
Persistent
opacification at the left base with progressive clearing of
opacification at
the right base.  No vascular congestion.

CXR [**7-8**] Portable:
IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification in left base with some
volume loss.

CXR [**7-10**] Portable: IMPRESSION:  Possible area of loculated fluid
with trapped air verses pneumothorax verses atypical appearance
of stomach bubble near the left CPA. Follow up upright chest
radiograph with the patient swallowing 15 cc of barium just
prior to imaging should help rule out these etiologies

CXR [**7-11**] PA/Lat: CONCLUSION:
There is no significant pneumothorax.

ECG [**7-17**]: Sinus rhythm. Borderline low QRS voltage. Possible
inferior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. The
lateral lead Q waves are likely not representative of a
myocardial infarction but rather septal Q waves. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2185-7-8**] the sinus rate has decreased by 20
beats per minute with no other diagnostic change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71063**] is a 77 yo M transferred from MICU [**7-7**] with
schizophrenia, neurogenic bladder, without guardianship, and
found to have pneumonia and bilateral pulmonary emboli causing
hypoxia/hypotension requiring pressors and intubation. He has
been relatively stable on the floor while undergoing treatment
for UTI.

# UTI- Currently has suprapubic catheter in setting of
neurogenic bladder and was found to have GNR's 10-100K in urine
on [**2185-7-3**]. Species on [**7-3**] was Alcaligenes achromobacter.
Patient complained of need to void urine on [**2185-7-11**] several
times which was new for him. His suprapubic catheter was changed
[**2185-7-13**] by urology. Levofloxacin was started on [**2185-7-11**] per
[**2185-7-3**] sensitivities; for total 14 day course (last day is
[**7-24**]).

# Acute Pulmonary Emboli: Patient previously on Coumadin. [**2185-6-24**]
CTA showed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and
subsegmental levels without evidence of right heart strain.
There was no clear cause for why he developed a PE. There was an
area of hypoenhancement within the atelectatic right lower lobe
along the periphery concerning for infarction. Increased
coumadin from 1mg po to 2mg po daily on [**2185-7-13**]. Further
increased coumadin from 2mg po to 4mg po daily on [**2185-7-16**]. His
INR has been difficult to manage, likely in setting of
antibiotics, malnutrition, Levothyroxine. On discharge, his
Coumadin has just been restarted at 3mg after he has been
supratherapeutic for the past 2 days. As an outpatient, he
should have his INR followed (check in 48-72hrs). If his INR <2,
he should be bridged with Lovenox 60mg q12h due to high risk for
thromboembolism. On discharge, he is on room air, slightly
tachypneic and tachycardic but has been stable.

# Tachycardia/Hypotension: Related to above.  Heart rates have
been in 80-110's. SBP <80s in the ICU requiring pressors.
Likely due to known pulmonary emboli with infection. Patient
does not currently have sx of infection, so sepsis is less
likely cause. It may be from pain, since patient is relatively
unable to communicate.

# Schizophrenia- Difficult to evaluate mental status. No
evidence of responding to internal stimuli. Baseline over past
few months [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is that he is able to communicate
pain/discomfort but does not have capacity.  He is mostly lucid
but answers questions in mumbles and broken statements.  Patient
had court date for guardianship on [**2185-7-19**] which was approved.
He sometime says inappropriate comments but not frequently.
Patient was ambulatory in [**Month (only) 205**] with assistance per previous [**Hospital1 1501**].
We continued his Depakote, Risperdal, and Remeron.

# Pneumonia, MRSA: Treated with 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn for
bilateral patchy infiltrate and found to be MRSA positive on
bronchial washings. Patient was hypotensive and hypoxic
requiring intubation and pressors for 10 days in MICU. Extubated
[**2185-7-6**]. [**2185-7-6**] CXR: Persistent opacification at the left base
with progressive clearing of right base without vascular
congestion. Later CXR cleared, he has finished treatment.

# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine started this admission for TSH
8.6 in setting of acute septic shock. TSH 7.8 on [**2185-7-9**]. He
should continue levothyroxine 25mcg po daily. He will need
outpatient follow up of TSH in 1 month [**2185-8-8**]

# FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes prn, ground solids, if ever
needs tube feeds, needs post-pyloric b/c hiatal hernia

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Continued on Levofloxacin until [**7-24**]
- Guardianship obtained during admission.
- Will need outpatient psych follow-up
- He will need close management of coumadin with goal INR [**12-24**]
indefinitely. He should have a bridge with Lovenox 60mg q12 if
ever INR<2. Discharge Coumadin dose is 3mg.
- please check TSH and free T4 on [**2185-8-8**]. Patient started on
levothyroxine [**2185-7-3**] for low Triiodothyronine Thyroxine (T4),
Free 0.78* and TSH 8.5.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71063**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] on [**2185-6-24**] for shortness of breath at your nursing
facility. You were found to have pneumonia with MRSA in your
lungs in addition to multiple blood clots in your lungs. This
required you to be in the intensive care unit on a ventilator
for over 1 week and requiring medicine to keep your blood
pressure normal. After you had several days of antibiotics for
your pneumonia, you were taken off the ventilator. Due to your
lung clots, you will need to be on coumadin (a blood thinner)
indefinitely. We have continued to change your dose depending on
your INR (which needs to be between [**12-24**] to help prevent blood
clots). You will be returning to your nursing home.  Please
follow up with your primary care physician.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your Primary Care physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **]
where you stay.

[**2153-1-17**]:
CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
Compared to the prior radiograph obtained yesterday, there is
decreased CHF.  There is mild cardiomegaly. There are small
bilateral effusions, more on the left. The new biventricular
pacer device is seen in the left hemithorax. The pacer leads are
seen in the right atrium and two in the floor of the right
ventricle. The previous abandoned right pacer leads are also
seen in the right atrium and right ventricle. No pneumothorax.
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving CHF.
2. Small bilateral layering pleural effusions, more on the left.

3. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
4. Good position of the new biventricular pacer device.
.
[**2153-1-17**]:
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.
FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. The
appearance of
the ventricles, cisterns, and sulci is unchanged. There is no
mass effect,
hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally midline structures. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved.
The visualized mastoid air cells are clear. Again noted is sinus
mucosal
thickening bilaterally in the maxillary sinuses, not fully
characterized here.
IMPRESSION:
1. Similar sinus mucosal thickening.
2. No evidence of significant interval change.
3. Similar appearance of the brain including prominent
encephalomalacic
changes in the right occipital lobe, and possibly in the left
occipital lobe as well.
.
[**2153-1-17**]:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a biventricular
pacemaker in place, not fully characterized here, and evidence
of prior sternotomy. There are large bilateral pleural effusions
with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis. Otherwise, the
lung bases are clear.
Within the limitations of the non-contrast study, the liver,
gallbladder,
pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. A
7-mm
nonobstructing stone is again visualized in the left kidney, as
well as a 12 mm stone in the left renal pelvis. These are
unchanged. A small new 2- mm nonobstructing stone is now seen in
the right kidney. Left-sided
hydronephrosis has resolved. Within the limitations of the
non-contrast study, the appearance of the kidneys is otherwise
unremarkable.
There is calcification of the abdominal aorta, and of the
splenic artery. The stomach, small and large bowel are
unremarkable. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric
lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.
Along the anterior left lateral ribs at the base of the chest,
there is a soft tissue density, not fully characterized here,
which may represent a small hematoma or inflammatory stranding
from recent pacer placement. Its
extent is not delineated here. There is no evidence of a
retroperitoneal
hematoma.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is considerable
amount of stool in the rectum. The prostate, seminal vesicles,
and bladder are within normal limits. There is a 5-mm calcific
density in the distal left ureter, which could represent a
nonobstructing stone. It was not seen previously.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Possible hematoma along the left basal chest wall, in the
subcutaneous
tissues, not fully evaluated here.
3. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
4. Multiple nonobstructing stones in the kidneys bilaterally, as
well as a 6- mm calcific density in the left pelvis, which may
represent a nonobstructing renal stone in the left ureter.
.
[**2153-1-18**]:
TECHNIQUE: Left upper extremity venous ultrasound and Doppler
examination,
and limited evaluation of the subcutaneous tissues of the left
upper
hemithorax.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left internal
jugular,
axillary, basilic, and paired brachial veins show no evidence of
deep vein
thrombosis. Because of the presence of the overlying pacer, the
left
subclavian vein could not be evaluated. No intraluminal thrombus
is
identified.
In the tissues overlying the pacemaker, there is heterogeneous
appearance,
which may represent postoperative change, but the presence of
hematoma cannot be excluded. No large discrete fluid collection
is identified. Laterally, near the insertion of the pectoralis
major muscle, the appearance suggests either edematous muscle or
complex fluid, but the static images presented are
indeterminant.
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous tissue in the region of the pacer, which is
indeterminant in etiology.
2. Suggestion of edematous left pectoral muscle and/or complex
fluid,
suggested by resident review in real time scanning. However on
the static
images, it is difficult to discern the relationship between the
muscle, the adjacent heterogeneous soft tissue, and the pacer.
A followup ultrasound for evaluation and comparison, or
alternatively a CT, which may show an area of hyperdensity to

Brief Hospital Course:
A 73yoM with parkinson disease, HTN, DM, systolic HF (EF 20% in
[**11-4**]), history of CVA (residual left visual field cut), AF s/p
AVN ablation and pacer, inmediate s/p BiV pacer upgrade with
slowly recover after sedation transfer to CCU for monitoring.
After the haldol wore off, mental status was felt to return to
baseline.  Of note, hematocrit was noted to drop on the day of
procedure.  CT abd/Pelvis was done and was negative for
retroperitoneal bleed.  Left upper extremity also noted to be
more swollen on [**1-18**] and ultrasound was performed which was
negative for DVT.

# mental status change: Patient likely sensitive to sedation,
requiring , more alert, able to follow simple commands. He is
able to movilize all extremities, still somnolent. more likely
given his baseline disease, he is more sensitive to sedation.
Patient seemed to recover in the 10-12 hours post-sedation.
Head CT was performed and was negative for intracranial bleed.
Neurology was consulted and agreed that mental status changes
likely to haldol being given.
.
1. Parkinson's disease: will continue home medications sinemet,
mirapex and pramipexol.

2. CV:
Rhythm: h/o Afib - heparin bridge to coumadin.  Heparin was
stopped in setting of hematocrit drop and restarted on [**2153-1-19**].
S/P BiV pacer- he was given Vancomycin Iv x 3 doses.
AV paced
Carvedilol continued for rate control
Pace maker checked on [**2153-1-19**].
Pump: EF 17% on MIBI, currently euvolemic. Will continue
Carvediolol and Furosemide home dose and digoxin. We will
recommend to discusse with your primary cardiologist regarding
Ace inhibitor medications
CAD: continue aspirin, statin, Carvedilol

3. Heme: On admission Hct noted to be 37.  This was likely
hemoconcentrated as Hcts from 3 weeks prior were 31-32.
However, given Hct decrease to 25, CT scan of Abd/Pelvis and
including upper thighs done and negative for hematoma or bleed.
He was tranfused 2 units of pRBCs and Hct increased. Hematocrit
should be monitored on an outpatient basis.

4. left upper extremity swelling: noted on [**1-18**].  Concern for
DVT or bleed. Ultrasound of upper extrmity done and negative for
DVT.

5. GERD: Continue Pantoprazole

6. FENA: Cardiac healthy -diabetic diet.

7.  Dispo: to rehab.  Patient should have Hematocrit checked on
[**1-22**] (Hct 27.6 on [**1-19**]).  Left upper extremity swelling seems to
be resolving.  His left arm may be elevated to decrease
swelling, but is not to be elevated above shoulder level given
new biVentricular pacemaker placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to ICU. Intubated.
1. Septic shock: GPC thought to be from line infection vs a
pulmonary source.  He was started on Vanco CTX, and Gent, with
requirement of pressor support for hypotension. Renal was
consulted and a decision was made to attempt to treat without
pulling the line.  The patient was weaned off of pressors.
Discussion with the patient's girlfriend revealed that he had
been having large volume diarrhea prior to being found on the
floor. Further discussion with surgery ensued and pt was slated
to go to the OR on [**7-4**] for evaluation of the infected graft
stump.

In early AM on [**7-4**], pt found to be in asystole. Immediately
started on pressors and IVF for hypotension.  Rhythm changed to
Vtach, labs sent and pt found to have hyperkalemia, started on
Bicarb, Insulin, glucose.  Rhythm returned to asystole, code
called, pt pronounced deceased at 4:10AM.

Chief Complaint:
Nausea, labored breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
endocardial biopsy


History of Present Illness:
35yF with multiple medical problems (including SLE, restrictive
lung disease, global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed
systolic function, nephrotic syndrome), with recent admission
[**Date range (1) 68983**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, re-admitted with
shortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea.

Her symptoms began in [**Month (only) **] (after a recent
hospitalization), when she developed diarrhea (which she relates
to her metoprolol). The diarrhea (multiple times daily,
non-bloody, brown in color) initially improved but then worsened
again. She then developed nausea, vomiting, and dry heaves,
without abdominal pain, and was admitted on [**10-10**]. She also
reported worsening shortness of breath, 3 pillow orthopnea, and
episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She was felt to be
intravascularly dry, so she was given IV fluids. She had a
thorough workup for causes of her diarrhea (infectious,
structural, medication related etc.) and was scheduled for GI
follow up on [**10-16**]. During the admission, an echocardiogram was
performed, demonstrating worsening systolic function (EF
15-20%), but she was felt to be intravascularly dry, so her
Lasix was held. Given the patient's concern that her diarrhea
started at the same time as metoprolol (75mg daily), this
medication was also stopped (and switched to carvedilol 3.125mg
[**Hospital1 **]). She was to have close follow up with her cardiologist. She
had acute on chronic renal failure which returned to close to
baseline (1.5) with IV fluids; she had a renal biopsy during
that admission, the results of which are still pending. Her
Imuran was initially held during the last hospitalization but
was restarted after a conversation with her [**Hospital1 112**] rheumatologist.
During that hospitalization, her nausea was not fully explained,
but there was a possibility that restarting her Imuran may have
contributed.

Her presentation today is similar. She has nausea and dry heaves
(non-bloody, non-bilious), along with worsening shortness of
breath/PND/orthopnea. Her husband (who follows her vitals
closely) has noted increased blood pressures and heart rates
since she was discharged from the hospital. Given her worsened
nausea and tachycardia to the 120's, he brought her to the
hospital. She denies any history of blood clot (but had IUFD at
21wks recently).

In the ED, triage vitals were T97.6F, HR 124, BP 126/109, RR 18,
Sat 100%. She was given 4mg IV ondansteron x 2, in addition to
ceftriaxone and azithromycin given an equivocal chest x-ray. She
was transferred to the floor for further evaluation. Her
respiratory rate was noted to be as high as 33.

On review of systems, she reports nausea and vomiting, as well
as shortness for breath and orthopnea as above. Diarrhea is
unchanged. She denies fevers, chills, chest pain (but perhaps
some chest ""heaviness""), palpitations, pleuritic chest pain,
cough, weakness, numbness, tingling, abdominal pain,
constipation, hematemesis, hematochezia, urinary symptoms.

Past Medical History:
- SLE: diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease
(membranous nephropathy by report of biopsy), facial rash,
Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis
- Gastritis
- Restrictive lung disease: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], noted to
be moderate to severe on PFTs completed 5/[**2179**].
- History of pancytopenia associated with varicella zoster
infection
- History of persistent thrombocytopenia
- Baseline proteinuria (Cr 0.8-0.9 pre-pregnancy)
- Intrauterine fetal demise [**7-/2180**] (at gestational age ~21wks)

normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2180-11-9**]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-11-6**],
left ventricular cavity size is smaller, global systolic
function is improved (quantitative biplane LVEF 30% on review of
prior study), and the severity of mitral regurgitation and
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are reduced.


Brief Hospital Course:
35yF with multiple medical problems (including SLE, restrictive
lung disease, global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed
systolic function, nephrotic syndrome), with recent admission
[**Date range (1) 68983**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, admitted with
shortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea.
.
#) Cardiomyopathy: Pt was initially admitted to the hospitalist
service but transferred for cath and endocardial biopsy in the
setting of worsening EF.  Her cardiomyopathy was thought to be
due to lupus.  Peripartum cardiomyopathy was also considered
however given the timing of onset and biopsy showing immune
complexes seen on endocardial biopsy, lupus cardiomyopathy was
thought to be more likely.  She was treated with steroids,
cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, IVIG and supportive care, and improved
from an EF of 15 to 33%.  It is unclear which therapy led to
improvement.  She did require temporary CCU transfer for
milrinone given worsening EF, however was weaned after a few
days and transferred back to the floor in stable condition.  Her
mitral regurgitation and hypertension also contributed to her
poor forward flow, and htn improved with diuresis, hydralazine,
lisinopril and amlodipine.
.
#) sCHF, volume overload: On admission, pt was clearly
tachypneic but satting well on room air. Reported 3 pillow
orthopnea and paroxysmal noctural dyspnea, in the setting of
recent d/c Lasix and IVF resuscitation, LE edema also suggested
fluid overload.  BNP extremely elevated at 65,187.  She also had
non-specific sxs concerning for HF including throat tightness
and GI sxs.  Her sxs improved with diuresis and symptomatic
management and she was discharged on oral torsemide.  She was
also treated with BP control and bblocker therapy.  Given her
SOB and LE edema R>L, a LE US was performed and showed no LE
clot, therefore PE was thought to be unlikely.
.
#) SLE. Pt diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease
previously membranous nephropathy, facial rash, Sjogren's
syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis.  Previously
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 68981**] at B&W, however has requested to transfer
her care to [**Hospital1 18**] after this admission.  Initially contined on
Plaquenil and Imuran, as well as prednisone.  Plaquenil dc'd per
rheumatology recs.  Cardiomyopathy and renal failure on current
admission were felt to be manifestation of underlying lupus.
Rheumatology was consulted and recommended aggressive therapy
with steriods, cytoxan and plasmapheresis.  Received solumedrol
1g daily x 3 followed by solumedrol 30mg IV q12hrs, which was
uptitrated to 60 q 12 hrs and subseuquently tapered and she was
ultimately discharged on prednisone 60mg orally daily.  She was
also placed on atovaquone PCP prophylaxis in the setting of
immunosuppression.  She recieved 1 dose of cytoxan 750mg on [**10-20**]
with mesna, cell counts with nadir on [**11-5**].  Prior to cytoxan,
she received 7.5mg Lupron for ovarian protection with plans to
pursue egg harvesting for fertility as an outpatient.  Received
5 cycles of plasmapheresis.  3 doses of IVIG was also
administered given that pts HF continued to worsen during the
hospital stay.  Additional plasmaphoreis was considered but held
due to her continued improvement.
.
#) Nausea/diarrhea. Initially thought secondary to restarting
Imuran, however pt and husband attributed to bblocker therapy.
Most likely due to gut edema in the setting of right HF.  GI was
consulted and agreed however recommended ruling out infectious
etiology given her immunosuppression; w/u was negative. She
improved with symptomatic tx and treatment of her HH.
.
#) thrombocytopenia: Pt bleeding from HD site [**10-21**], improved
with Cryo, Platelets, and Surgicel. Patient developed
thrombocytopenia with nadir of 68, likely multifactorial related
to dilution, imunnosupression, and possibly pheresis.  Heme
consulted and recommended removing ASA, NSAIDs, all heparin
products, f/u LFTs, fibrinogen.  Platelet drop was too quick to
be related to Cytoxan and likelihood of developping 4T score is
3. HIT ab negative. Fibrinogen nomralized. Thrombocytopenia
quickly improved, however then fluctuated in the setting of
cytoxan use.  IgG and IgM ACA negative, so unlikely to have
prothrombotic state.
.
#) Acute on chronic RF: Pt with h/o SLE Nephritis. Pt previously
with membranous nephropathy on prior biopsy.  She had repeat
biopsy showing type 3,4,5 lupus nephritis.  Worsening renal
failure with creatinine increased to 3.7 up from 1.4 on
admission.  Urine lytes indicative of prerenal ischemia (FeUrea
< 0.02%) +/- evolving ATN  likely from poor cardiac output/
cardiorenal syndrome.  renal U/S show's no obstruction.   While
her renal function showed some initial worsening with diuresis,
diuresis was continued due to continued volume overload, and
creatinine remained stable.
.
# HTN: BPs improved with uptitration of hydralazine and addition
of lisinopril.  Pt concerned that hydralazine may be causing
joint pain.  Given this and her improved renal function,
lisinopril was uptitrated and hydralazine discontinued.  Blood
pressures stable
.
# Anemia:  Likely due to acute renal disease, cytoxan therapy.
Pt was given one unit of PRBCs while in patient and started on
epo with good improvement in her crit.
.
# Joint pain: ? medication side effect (IVIG, hydralazine) vs
lupus flare, however pt has never had joint pain with lupus
flares in the past.  Hydralazine was discontinued, symptomatic
relief with tylenol, PT.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o male with metastatic rectal ca diagnosed [**3-26**] s/p xrt
(last [**6-25**]) and chemo (last [**2120-9-25**]) who was admitted with
diarrhea, fever, and neutropenia who developed hypoxemia, lactic
acidosis, and confusion.  Since his admission, the patient's
diarrhea and fevers had progressively improved on cefepime,
vancomycin, and metronidazole as well as Lomotil.  Since then
his course has been complicated by a steadily declining
hematocrit (33 to 25 over the admission), worsening
thrombocytopenia, and a new coagulopathy (INR up to 5.4).  On
[**10-12**], he was noted to be hypoxemic and had chest x-ray showing
only a distended stomach and a CTA with no PE (but also a
distended stomach and known liver mets).  ABG was 7.44/25/63
then 7.32/21/84 that afternoon.  His oxygen requirement waxed
and waned, from mid 80's on room air to mid 90's on room air.
His hypoxemia persisted and the patient became increasingly
tired, confused, and tachypneic.  A repeat ABG was 7.3/19/75 but
his lactate had climbed from 3.5 to 8.0. He was transferred to
the ICU at which time he was fatigued and appeared disoriented.
In this setting, he denied pain (including abdominal) as well as
dyspnea despite obvious tachypnea and mild accessory muscle use.
He was started on IVF with 3 amps bicarb, lactate trended down,
acidosis resolving. CT abdomen showed SBO with no obvious cut
off for obstruction a NGT placed and medical management
recommeneded by surgery. Primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
continued to follow.
  In the ICU he was found to have guiaic positive NGT
secretions.  He was transfused PRBCs for a dropping HCT.  In
addition he was noted to have an elevated INR for which he was
treated with FFP.  He was evaluated by surgery who felt him to
be a poor surgical candidate.  For his confusion a CT of his
head was performed which was negative for bleed or other change.
 His hypoxia resolved and was felt to be due to aspiration
initially.  He was treated with TPN given his poor nutritional
status.  He was treated with octroetide per surgery recs with no
improvement.  On [**2120-10-18**] a family meeting was held at which
time it was decided that the goal of care was maximal comfort.
At that meeting it was decided to continue with fluids and
analgesia but to limit other medications and TPN.  The family
will provide Chinese herbs and prayer.
.
# GI: Diarrhea was believed to be chemo-induced diarrhea.  The
patient was covered with cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl given
neutropenic fever.  The CT of abdomen on admission did not show
any inflammatory processes in the abdomen. The patient was given
supportive care with IVF and Lomotil once obtained stool samples
for cultures which were negative and his diarrhea improved with
lomotil.  However, patient became acidotic and CT abdomen was
repeated and revealed SBO. NGT was placed and surgey was
consulted but did not feel that the patient was a good surgical
candidate. Patient was continued on medical management.
Octreotide was added to his regimen to help to relieve
obstruction. His lactate continued to trend down and NGT outout
began to slow. Patient denied any abdominal pain.
    However, while in the ICU he developed bloody stools in the
setting of coagulopathy. This was felt to be likely secondary to
his rectal cancer. He was tranfused pRBCs and FFP. After several
bloody stools and rectal tube placement his bloody bowel
movements slowed, his coags improved and his hematocrit was
stable.
.
Coagulopathy: Likely DIC secondary to cancer. He devloped GI
bleed as mentioned above and was transfused several units of FFP
and pRBCs and 1 unit of platelets. By tranfer from the ICU his
HCT and INR was stable but platelets were 34. The patient and
family did not want any further transfusions as their goal was
comfort and this would require daily monitoring of his CBC and
coags.
.
# NEUTROPENIC FEVER: The patient was started on cefepime, vanco,
and flagyl on admission. He had some fevers early in his
hospitalization but remained afebrile for the rest of his
admission. He because hypoxic and acidotic and a CT chest was
otained which revealed likely aspiration/pneumonia. He was
continue on his antibiotics to complete a 14 day course and
received daily neupogen injections. By the 11th day of his
antibiotic course he was no longer neutropenic. His neupogen was
discontinued and he remained afebrile.

# AG METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: concerning for lactic acidosis [**1-24**] to
hypovolemia.  Patient refused central line/sepsis protocol in
ED. He was  hemodynamically stable on transfer to the floor.
Lactate normalized after IVF. Then the patient continued to have
non-anion gap acidosis [**1-24**] to diarrhea.  ABG was obtained and
the patient appropriately compensated with decreased CO2 (25)
with normal pH 7.4-7.44. He then became more hypoxic and acidotc
and was tranferred to the ICU. In the ICU it was discoved that
he had an extremely dilated stomach and SBO. It was felt that
the lactic acidosis ,may have been secondary to the extreme
distension of his stomach given the rapid decline in his lactate
on decompression with NGT. His gap closed and his lactate
conitnued to tened down.
.
# RECTAL CANCER: Last chemotherapy was last avastin/5FU on [**9-25**].
Given that he did not tolerate this well, no further
chemotherapy was planned. He also developed what is believed to
be lower GI bleed, SBO and DIC during admission all which were
thaough to be related to his metastatic disease. Due to his poor
prognosis and worsening medical condition a family meeting was
held and the family and patient agreed that comfort was the most
important goal at this point. He was continued on IVF and the
NGGT was kept in place to prevent worsening pain from his SBO.
It was decided that no further blood products would be given.
.
FEN: Patient was actively hydrated in the setting of diarrhea
and acidosis. He was continued on IVF given his SBO. Given his
poor prognosis and that comfort was the goal, he was not started
on TPN, but rather hydrated with IVF in the setting of SBO.

History of Present Illness:
pt is a a 55 F with h/o RA (on methotrexate, enbrel, prednisone)
and spinal stenosis who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2184-1-1**] s/p
recent fall with ""inability to walk."" Pt apparently had
developed increasing weakness of her lower extremities with some
urinary incontinence. Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt was treated with
narcotics for pain of the left lower extremity and back, and
developed mental status changes. Her O2 sats acutely dropped,
(etiology unclear, [**2-7**] narcotics versus infiltrate), with
tachycardia to 140s, hypoxia to 88%, and CTA showing RLL/RML
opacity but no PE. Pt was intubated for airway protection and
transferred to MICU.
.
MRI spine on [**1-1**] revealed severe L3-L5 spinal stenosis for
which pt underwent lumbar decompression of L2-S1 on [**1-2**] with
gross pus evident in epidural space. X-ray of the foot revealed
left ankle fracture, for which she was placed in a walking cast.
She also had cervical and retropharyngeal abscesses, for which
she underwent cervical decompression and drainage of cervical
abscesses, from C2-C7, with instrumentation and fusion from
C3-C7, on [**2183-1-8**]. Retropharyngeal abcesses were drained, and
she had bilateral knee arthrocentesis and washout for septic
joints. Pt was treated with vancomycin after nafcillin resulted
in rash (pt seen by derm, termed ""drug hypersensitivity""). In
addition, on [**1-3**] pt noted to have SVT, with rate up to the
160s, and SBP decrease. She was cardioverted x2 and started on
amiodarone, which has since been discontinued. Pt seen by
cardiology, without apparent further recommendation.
.
Pt most recently taken to OR on [**2183-1-25**] for debridement of
postoperative lumbar wound, and decompression of L4-5 and repair
of dural leak after pt was persistently febrile and MRI of
lumbar spine showed fluid collection (+GPC per aspiration). Pt
last febrile on [**1-25**].
.
Pt exubated on [**1-21**] per notes, and now breathing comfortably on
RA. Lower extremity weakness appears largely resolved, though pt
signficantly deconditioned [**2-7**] hospitalization. Per ortho/spine,
pt full weight bearing, though must wear hard cervical collar at
all times, and TLSO brace whenever out of bed.

IMAGING:
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2183-1-1**] 6:01 PM
1. No major organ injury in the abdomen.
2. Bilateral acute and chronic rib fractures as described above,
as seen on the prior chest CT.
3. Bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis as seen
on the prior CT.
4. Small left retroperitoneal fluid.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2183-1-1**] 11:40 AM
1. Airspace opacities in the lower lobe and right middle lobe
with volume loss suggesting atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be
completely excluded on the radiology basis.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. No pulmonary embolus identified.
4. Multiple old fractures of the ribs bilaterally at different
stages. Some are clearly healed, some are healing and some
appear somewhat acute. Clinical correlation is recommended.
.
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-1-1**] 5:56 PM
At L2/3, moderate canal stenosis due to degenerative changes and
epidural lipomatosis. At L3/4 and L4/5, severe canal stenosis
and severe right foraminal stenosis due to combination of
degenerative changes, disk herniations, and epidural
lipomatosis.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2183-1-1**] 8:45 AM
Bibasilar atelectasis with possible infiltrate at the right
base.
No other obvious acute findings.
.
ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT  [**2183-1-1**] 7:04 AM
1. Base of fifth metatarsal fracture.
2. Possible nondisplaced distal fibular fracture.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2183-1-1**]  4:23:48 PM
Sinus tachycardia
Right bundle branch block
Low voltage
Inferior ST segment elevation suggestive of inferior myocardial
infarction
Since previous tracing of [**2182-12-2**], inferior changes are new -
clinical
correlation is suggested
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2183-1-3**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W& W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-1-11**] 9:43 PM
1. Overall improved prevertebral area of abscess seen on [**2183-1-6**].
Secondary to inadequate post-contrast T1-weighted images, the
tissue remaining in this area could represent either persistent
abscess versus postoperative changes. If clinically indicated, a
repeat, contrast-enhanced scan could be performed.
2. Unchanged intraspinal epidural signal that overall appears
less extensive compared to previous exam.
3. New hyperintense signal at the T2 to T3 interspace could
represent progression of discitis.
4. Likely bilateral pleural effusions. Infectious etiology
cannot be ruled out based on these images secondary to poor
post-contrast study.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2183-1-31**] 9:55 AM
Interval placement of right-sided PICC line with tip in the
right atrium.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt was treated with narcotics for pain of the
left lower extremity and back, and developed mental status
changes.  Her O2 sats acutely dropped, (etiology unclear, [**2-7**]
narcotics versus infiltrate), with tachycardia to 140s, hypoxia
to 88%, and CTA showing RLL/RML opacity but no PE.  Pt was
intubated for airway protection and transferred to MICU.
.
MRI spine on [**1-1**] revealed severe L3-L5 spinal stenosis.  X-ray
of the foot revealed left ankle fracture, for which she was
placed in a walking cast.  She also had cervical and
retropharyngeal abscesses, and was transferred to the SICU.
.
SICU Course
Pt was admitted to SICU post-operatively after L3/L4 & L5/s1
decompression/laminectomy for epidural abscess on [**1-2**].
Neuro: PT was admitted with altered MS, and was maintained on
propofol while intubated for sedation.
.
CV: PT had episode of SVT on [**1-3**], was shocked twice and
returned to [**Location 15364**] was consulted and recommended
amiodarone, which was d/c'd prior to transfer to floor.  Pt had
a TEE on [**1-14**] that was negative for thrombus (concern for septic
emboli).  Pt also had an IVC filter placed on [**1-14**] for PE
prophylaxis.  Pt was maintained on lopressor with tight BP
control while in the SICU, and she had no further cardiac
issues.
.
Resp: Pt was extubated initially on [**2183-1-5**], but was
re-intubated on [**2183-1-6**] [**2-7**] respiratory distress.  On [**1-9**], pt had
R VATS/decortication/washout for R empyema, and on [**1-17**] pt had a
pleural tap; the pleural fluid from [**1-9**] grew MSSA, and the
pleural fluid from [**1-17**] was no growth.  Additionally, the pt had
2 [**Doctor Last Name **] drains post-operatively that were pulled on [**1-16**] and
[**1-22**].
.
Musculoskeletal: Pt had L3/L4 and L5/S1
laminectomy/decompression on [**1-2**], on [**1-7**] pt had C5-6 ACDF
w/ICBG & Post Cervical decompression for cervical prevertebral
abscess, on [**1-9**] pt had knee tap with MSSA and subsequent bilat
knee washouts (left knee was not infected - the drains were
d/c'd on [**1-11**].  On [**1-24**], pt went to IR for drainage of L3,4,5
collection (approx 10cc out).  On [**1-25**], pt returned to OR w/
ortho spine for debridement of postoperative lumbar wound, and
decompression of L4-5 and repair of dural leak after pt was
persistently febrile and MRI of lumbar spine showed fluid
collection (+GPC per aspiration).  Pt last febrile on [**1-25**].
.
ID: Pt was initially started on nafcillin/gentamicin; initial Cx
were positive for MSSA and pt was maintained on nafcillin until
[**1-13**], when she developed a drug rash and was changed to
vancomycin.  Additionally, on [**1-18**] pt developed papular rash
over posterior thighs and peri-rectal area and was started on
acyclovir.  Pt was intermittently febrile without obvious source
throug much of ICU stay, but was afebrile for several days prior
to transfer to floor.  Her pertinent Cx data is below:
.
[**1-25**]: abscess Cx: coag + staph
[**1-21**]: UCx/BCx - NG
[**1-18**]: +HSV2; skin tiss: rare CSNx2, enterr, coryn, diptheriod

MSSA
12/27,28,31: BLd Cx MSSA
GI: While patient was intubated, she was started on tubefeeds
for nutrition; following extubation, pt was advanced to a
regular diet without problem.  Pt was maintained on GI ulcer
prophylaxis with H2-blocker while in the ICU.

Medicine Floor Course
.
#Neuro: mental status improved spontaneously.  Neuro exam
stable.  CN2-12 intact, MAE. 4/4 strength B/L uppers, left >
right.  LE grossly intact bilaterally.  wiggles left toes.  hip
flexion, knee flexion and extension [**1-10**] b/l.  [**5-10**] [**Last Name (un) 15365**] and
plantar flexion of right LE.  left LE wiggles toes, mobility
limited by cast.  Per ortho/spine, pt full weight bearing,
though must wear hard cervical collar at all times, and TLSO
brace for 6 weeks whenever sitting up unsupported or out of bed.

-Vancomycin was continued per ID recs for multiple abcesses, at
least 8 week duration s/p [**1-25**] debridement. Hardware cleared for
repeat MRI if needed.
.
# ID: last fever on [**1-22**] was 102.3, pt was followed by ID for
multiple spinal abcesses, on vancomycin for MSSA given pt had
rash in reaction to nafcillin (seen by derm, ""drug
hypersensitivity reaction"" on [**2183-1-13**]).  Pt was placed on
acyclovir for perianal ulcers which grew HSV 2 on [**2183-1-18**], but
this was d/c'ed [**2183-1-28**]. Leukocytosis trending down with normal
diff.  Prednisone for RA as above, but further immunosupression
was avoided. Vancomycin was continued for now, plan for 8 week
course s/p last debridement on [**2183-1-25**].  Vancomycin end date is
[**2183-3-24**]. A psoas abcesses was too small to drain per IR.
Bilateral knee swelling s/p arthrocentesis and washout decreased
over time, without redness tenderness.
Needs weekly CBC w/diff, BUN/creat ratio, vanco trough.
.
# PULMONARY: pt initially presented without respiratory
symptoms, however was intubated in ED [**2-7**] increasing mental
status changes (?[**2-7**] narcotic medications) for airway
protection.  subsequent CT showed ?right side pneumonia.  Pt
extubated on [**1-5**] s/p OR for spinal procedure, then reintubated
on [**1-6**] (presumably [**2-7**] developing empyema felt [**2-7**] septic emboli
for which pt went to OR on [**1-9**] for VATS and chest tube
placement, though not clear), and extuabted on [**1-21**].  [**Name (NI) 15366**],
pt without SOB, on RA.  chest tube removed [**1-27**], and CXR s/p
removal showing small right side effusion, no PTX, no pneumonia.
 O2 was weaned, and ipratropium nebs continued.
.
# CARDIAC: Pt was placed on telemetry.  Episode of SVT on [**1-30**]
to 120s, no chest pain or SOB.  EKG showed sinus tachy, old RBBB
and new ST depressions in V3, V4 and inferior leads.  ST
depressions quickly resolved.  Troponin and CK-MB were negative
x 3.  Metoprolol increased in house to 75mg PO TID. ASA was
started.
.
# RENAL: pt with foley in place, presumably placed given initial
urinary incontinence, however, pt may be able to urinate on her
own now.  for now will continue foley given pt difficulty on
bedpan.  creatinine trending downward from 1.1. on admission to
0.5 presently, likely represents loss of muscle mass.
.
# GI: pt with h/o hiatal hernia, on omeprazole at home. Did not
have complaints of abdominal pain presently, LFTs and alk
phosphate mildly elevated on admission, now within normal
limits.  Pt tolerating regular diet without difficulty.  Per
intervential radiology, psoas abcess too small to drain.
Lansoprazole continued given steroid regimen.
.
# GU: no urinary complaints presently, foley in place presumably
[**2-7**] incontinence earlier during admission.
.
# ENDO:  pt on prednisone chronically for RA, and initially
received pulse dose of steroids (hydrocort/fludrocort) given
concern for adrenal insufficiency.  insulin sc sliding scale was
dc/d on [**2-1**] due to blood sugars less than 150 for 24 hours.
pt seen by endocrine service who recommend minimum dose of
prednisone 10mg po qdaily give almost certain component of
adrenal insufficiency.  home regimen of prednisone 15mg qdaily
(home regimen for RA) was continued
.
# PAIN: pt with h/o LBP [**2-7**] spinal stenosis, and myofascial pain
syndrome.  pt being seen by pain service during this admission.
 pt on ultram, oxycodone, and indomethacin at home.  Was placed
on hydromorphone transiently, but this decreased her alertness.
now on percocet [**1-7**] tab PRN, fentanyl patch, standing
acetaminophen and ibuprofen with meals
.
# RHEUM: Pt with h/o RA, on enbrel, methotrexate, indomethacin,
sulfadiazine (?) at home, however (except prednisone) all are
being held presently in light of multiple infections.  Knee exam
without obvious effusion presently, healing well s/p
athrothrocentesis.  will follow for now and encourage PT.
Continued on nsaids for RA. DMARDS were not restarted due to
abscesses. Should followup with her outpatient rheumatologist.
.
# PSYCH: Pt with h/o anxiety and depression, presently somewhat
anxious, especially during movement, transition to sitting.
Ativan was continuedprn.
.
#FEN: Advanced to regular diet with ensure for increased caloric
intake.  Mg and K were replete lytes as needed.
.
#PPx: Pt was given lovenox and IVC filter for DVT prophylaxis.
PPI given steroid regimen. Bowel regimen
.
# DC to Rehab.

Chief Complaint:
Hypotension with elevated lactate, code sepsis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular venous catheter placement.


History of Present Illness:
44 yoM PMH ESRD secondary to Brights disease on HD s/p two
failed renal transplants, HCV, CHF with EF 20%, AF on coumadin
who presented to the ED with a two week history of diffuse
abdominal pain with one day of nausea and vomiting [**2114-12-24**]. Two
weeks prior to admission the patient began to experience diffuse
dull abdominal pain without nausea or vomiting and loose stools
2-3 times per day. The patient believed this was secondary to
fluid overload. One week prior to presentation the patient
complained of subjective fevers, cough productive of yellow
sputum. His nephrologist gave him a five-day course of
azithromycin. The patient had persistent symptoms and was
started on levofloxacin by his PCP two days prior to admission.
The patient had a history of tylenol use 3g/day for 5 days prior
to admission for fever, body aches. The day prior to admission
the patient began to experience worsened abdominal pain
associated with nausea, a few episodes of vomiting,
nonbilious/nonbloody, and diarrhea 4-5 times per day, watery,
nonbloody.
.
In the ED the patient was found to be hypotensive with lactate
of 5.6 and a code sepsis was called. He was given Vanco, Flagyl
and Zosyn for presumed infection. He was given Decadron for
presumed adrenal insufficiency. He was also given Calcium
gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, Insulin and D50 for hyperkalemia.
A CVL was placed and he received 3L of NS with normalization of
pressures. He was transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU the patient's LFTs were significantly elevated and
peaked at ALT 3016, AST 2956, LDH [**2064**], INR 4.3 on [**12-25**]. This
was thought to be secondary to shock liver in the setting of
hypotension/sepsis versus tylenol toxicity despite negative
serum tylenol. LFTs subsequently trending down.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient continues to complain of
cough productive of yellow sputum. Denies chest pain, shortness
of breath. The patient denied any fevers/chills, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting. Diarrhea improving. Denies dysuria/hematuria;
minimal urine output while on HD. Denies lightheadedness. Denies
myalgias/arthralgias. Review of systems otherwise negative in
detail.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2114-12-24**]
IMPRESSION:
Clear lungs, mild pulmonary congestion and cardiomegaly,
unchanged.
.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2114-12-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly with abnormal liver perfusion
likely secondary to passive congestion (nutmeg liver). No focal
hepatic abscess or adjacent hematoma.
2) Cholelithiasis and sludge/vicarious excretion of IV contrast.
Small amount of pericholecystic fluid is present. The fluid
could be due to patient's liver dysfunction/third spacing from
CHF. If cholecystitis is of clinical concern, HIDA scan can be
performed provided the total bilirubin is not elevated.
3) Hyperdense renal cortex in left lower quadrant transplanted
kidney. Findings are most likely due to chronic rejection or
prior ATN. There is apparent thickening of the arterial wall
supplying the transplant. No hydronephrosis or perinephric
collection.
4) Minor anatomic variant involving liver vasculature as
described above. Hepatic veins and portal venous system appear
widely patent.
5) 6 mm lesion in head of pancreas. Continued follow up of this
area is recommended on future studies.
6) Areas of ground glass opacity and intralobular septal
thickening in the lung bases, most likely due to fluid
overload/CHF. Nodular areas of opacity are also present which
could be due to infection. Continued followup is reccomended.
7) Small lymph nodes and vague retroperitoneal stranding.
Findings could be due to CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 year-old male with past medical history of ESRD on HD, HCV,
presenting with hypotension and elevated lactate, presumed
sepsis without source found. The patient was noted to have
elevated LFTs on admission. The patient was found to be HIT Ab
positive.
.
1. Sepsis: There was no source found, but patient had received
antibiotics prior to admission. The patient remained afebrile
and hemodynamically stable throughout transfer to the floor. The
patient had leukocytosis on admission but this resolved prior to
transfer. The patient completed an empiric seven-day course of
vancomycin/zosyn and ten-day course of flagyl. The patient's
immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine for history of renal
transplant was discontinued; prednisone 10 mg QOD was continued.
CXR x 2 without evidence of pneumonia. The patient's blood,
urine, stools, and sputum cultures were negative at the time of
discharge. C. difficile toxin B was negative. The patient
complained of continued cough and loose stools which were
improving prior to discharge.
.
2. Hypotension: Resolved prior to transfer to the floor. Likely
sepsis given elevated lactate. Hypovolemia possible in setting
of poor po prior to admission. Cardiac etiology unlikely; no
significant change in cardiac function and cardiac enzymes
unrevealing. Adrenal insufficiency was unlikely with random
cortisol of 36,  however, the patient on chronic steroids; the
patient was continued on prednisone 10 mg every other day for
history of renal transplant. The patient received treatment for
sepsis as above.
.
3. Elevated LFTs/coagulopathy: Secondary to shock liver versus
tylenol toxicity. The patient was initially maintained on
mucomyst gtt but this was discontinued when the patient's liver
function tests improved. There was likely a component of
congestion secondary to CHF. This was unlikely secondary to HCV
as there was no change in immunosuppression and only mild active
inflammation on very recent biopsy. Unlikely to be due to recent
liver biopsy. The patient's liver function tests continued to
trend down prior to discharge.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's coumadin was initially
held in the setting of liver failure and elevated INR. The
patient's digoxin and amiodarone were initially held in the
setting of renal and liver failure and the patient's rate was
subsequently poorly-controlled to heart rate 130-140s. The
patient was followed by his primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**],
during admission. The patient's amiodarone was restarted and
increased from previous per his recommendations. Digoxin was not
restarted. The patient's elanopril was discontinued on admission
and the patient was started on captopril; there was an attempt
to up-titrate the dose but the patient's blood pressure did not
tolerate the increase. The patient was discharged on captopril
6.25 twice daily. The patient's blood pressure does not tolerate
beta-blocker therapy. The patient was restarted on coumadin
prior to discharge. The patient's rapid ventricular rate is most
likely compensatory for low ejection fraction; rate control to
110-120s is acceptable. The patient's rate was at goal 110s-120s
on discharge. The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] as an
outpatient.
.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine [**5-2**]. The
patient is on HD status post two failed renal transplants. The
differential for the patient's acute renal failure included
acute tubular necrosis and cyclotoxicity (recently on
azithromycin). The patient's ACE inhibitor was initially held.
The patient's creatinine did not improve to baseline and was 7.5
prior to discharge. The patient was followed by the renal
service throughout hospitalization. The patient continued to
receive hemodialysis per his MWF schedule. The patient was
started on sensipar for elevated PTH. The patient was continued
on prednisone 10 mg QOD for history of renal transplant. The
patient's cyclosporine was discontinued. Amphogel was
discontinued and cinecalcet was added to the patient's regimen.
.
6. Thrombocytopenia/HIT Ab positive: HIT antibodies were sent
because of the patient's thrombocytopenia. The patient's HIT
antibodies were positive. The patient had been on heparin SC and
heparin flushes in the MICU but these were discontinued prior to
transfer to the floor. The patient was followed by hematology
during admission. The patient had a right basilic vein
thrombosis visualized but no other signs or symptoms of
thrombosis. After discussion with hematology and pharmacy, the
patient was started on argatroban and bridged to coumadin. The
patient's INR goal was 2.5-3.5 given his history of liver
disease.
.
7. Congestive heart failure. EF of 10% per echo [**12-28**] with 3+ MR,
2+ TR. Mixed ischemic/nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.
Patient has a fixed LAD/anterior defect on MIBI on 2/[**2114**]. The
patient is status post ICD placement [**1-1**]. The patient was
started on captopril as above. The patient's blood pressure does
not tolerate beta-blocker therapy. The patient's volume status
was addressed at hemodialysis. The patient was assessed for
biventricular ICD by EP; the decision was made not to place at
this time given the patient's narrow QRS duration and especially
in the setting of recent sepsis. The patient will follow-up with
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 437**] in [**5-3**] weeks. The patient will receive
outpatient cardiopulmonary assessment for possible cardiac
transplant.
.
8. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and
stent [**2105**]. The patient was without complaints of chest pain
throughout admission. The patient was continued on aspirin. The
patient's elanopril was discontinued and the patient was started
on captopril as above. The patient's blood pressure does not
tolerate beta-blocker therapy.
.
9. Nucleated red blood cells. There were 20 NRBC/100 white blood
cells on the patient's blood smear on transfer to the floor,
with low grade hemolysis and high reticulocyte count. Hematology
was consulted and believed this was likely secondary to
hyperactive marrow stimulated in the setting of recent sepsis.
This resolved prior to discharge.

Chief Complaint:  acute SOB

Reason for MICU transfer:  suspected PE, sepsis [**3-8**] UTI


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63F w/ recurrent stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian CA on cycle
8 day 14 of carboplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab (avastin),
complicated by ureter obstruction requiring left ureteral stent
and right nephrostomy tube. She had a week of SOB PTA but on
[**6-16**] had acute onset of SOB when at home, with fever, without
cough, and no abd pain, no dysuria. Oncologic course has been
complicated by b/l hydronephrosis thought to be [**3-8**] malignancy,
as well as utereral obstructions requiring right nephrostomy
tube.

In the ED, initial VS were:  101 108 158/67 24 100% 2L (highest
temp was 102.3). EKG showed ST 106 incomplete RB on previous,
incomplete L bundle.  CTA was deferred due to elevated Cr.
Non-con belly scan was ordered and bedside u/s showed normal
fast, no pericardial effusion, no right heart strain, mild left
hydronephrosis, normal right kidney. She was started on
Vanc/Cefepime and given APAP. Urine from nephrostomy was cloudy;
Foley'd urine was the second drawn. Heparin gtt was commenced
for suspected PE. She had an elevated pro-BNP but normal trop,
and no right axis deviation on ECG or on u/s: was not a
candidate for TPA.

On arrival to the MICU, she does not c/o any pain, but is still
feeling SOB, better when supine as opposed to sitting up.  She
denies CP, HA, abdom pain, pain upon deep inspiration, pain in
calves/thighs. Adds that on day of admission, she felt more SOB
fairly abruptly while sitting outside; at baseline, has no h/o
heart problems or SOB when walking. She still urinates and also
has UOP through the nephrostomy tube; is maintaining PO intake
and says she still made urine at home today.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18573**] is a 63F w/ recurrent stage IIIC papillary
serous ovarian CA on cycle 8 day 14 of carboplatin, gemcitabine,
bevacizumab (avastin), and b/l hydronephrosis [**3-8**] ureter
obstruction requiring left ureteral stent and right nephrostomy
tube. She p/w acute onset SOB in the setting of one week of
dyspnea and fatigue, which was initially concerning for PE.
Further w/u ended up ruling out PE, and her SOB was likely in
the context of her fever and GNR bacteremia, which were likely
[**3-8**] urinary source.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Dyspnea: Pt p/w acute onset SOB, and was found to be in sinus
tach with elevated d-dimer and BNP in setting of malignancy,
although bedside u/s showed no e/o R heart strain. She did not
undergo CTA due to elevated Cr, but was started on a heparin gtt
in the ED. Upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had no Si/Sx of
hemodynamic or respiratory collapse. ACS, PNA or pulmonary edema
were r/o. LENIs were obtained, which were negative. A VQ scan
was subsequently performed, and it was low probability for PE
and the heparin was d/c'd. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] her SOB vastly improved
without further intervention. Her dyspnea was most likely due to
her anemia as she significantly improved after transfusion of 2
units pRBCs for a HCT of 18.
.
# Fevers and UTI: UTI was likely cause for her fevers to 102.3
and diff with 91% PMNs. Pt has a h/o b/l hydronephrosis [**3-8**]
ureter obstruction requiring left ureteral stent and right
nephrostomy tube, and all UA's have been positive with pyuria
and hematuria since [**2-15**]. Upon admission, she again had positive
UA's from both foley and nephrostomy tube. She received
vanc/cefepime in the ED; her past urine Cx's have grown E coli
sensitive to cefepime. Per past urology notes, her R kidney is
not functioning as well as the left, and no other urological
interventions were necessary; she is scheduled for a left stent
change in [**7-17**].
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GNRs grew out of her blood Cx from [**6-16**], and
she was continued on cefepime (d1=[**6-16**]), and continued on vanc
(d1=[**6-16**]) given that she has a port. Her urine culture grew coag
+ staph and per Urology, it was recommended to continue treating
the UTI w/o indication for stent removal at this time. Her urine
culture eventually speciated as pansensitive staphylococcus
aureus, and she was transitioned to oral augmentin to compelte a
total 14 day course following discharge.  Her blood cultures
speciated as pansensitive E. coli and she was transitined to
oral ciprofloxacin, also to complete a 14 day course, priro to
dishcarge.  She remained afebrile and stable on oral antibiotics
for 24 hours prior to discharge.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline Cr is about 1.2-1.3; pt initially p/w Cr 1.9.
Likely prerenal etiology given fever and UTI and FeNa of 0.9%.
She has a h/o obstruction, but had been maintaining good UOP
from urethra and nephrostomy. Her Cr improved in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to 1.4
after 2 units pRBCs, and subsequently improved further to 1.2 by
the time of discharge.
.
# Anemia: Macrocytic anemia with Hct 24.9 and MCV 102 on
admission; baseline Hct is in high 20's. She had no Si/Sx of
active bleeding upon admission, although the pt endorses small
amts of blood in stool while on avastin, known to heme-onc. She
had a 6-point Hct drop after admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with no
identified source; her Hct bumped appropriately after 2U PRBC's.
Her stool was guaiac negative.
.
CHRONIC OR INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Most likely [**3-8**] chemo per her primary
oncologist, as per hx of similar s/p chemo and is unlikely HIT
as her platelets were decreased upon admission and before the
initiation of the heparin gtt.
.
# Recurrent stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian CA on cycle 8
day 14 of carboplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab (avastin).
.
# HTN: initially held home lisinopril 5mg daily given fevers,
UTI, and [**Last Name (un) **]. Once her creatinine decreased to 1.4, her home
lisinopril was re-started.

Ms. [**Known lastname 18573**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the [**Hospital1 771**].  You were admitted with shortness of
breath and fevers.  You were initially admitted to our intensive
care unit, where you were treated with antibiotics.  Your blood
counts were found to be low, and you were given blood
transfusions. You were initally started on a blood thinner to
treat you for a potential blood clot in your lungs, but
subsequent studies showed that you were unlikely to have
developed a blood clot, and the blood thinner was stopped.  Your
breathing improved after blood transfusion.

We found that you have an infection in your blood and urine.
You were treated initially with intravenous antibiotics, and
eventually switched to oral antibiotics.  You will need to
compelte a course of oral antibiotics as an outpatient.  Please

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7842**] is a 47 year old male who presented to OSH with left
sided chest pain, dizziness and diaphoresis while showering. CTA
revealed Type A aortic dissection. He was emergently med
flighted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical intervention.

Physical Exam:
At the time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 7842**] was found to be awake,
alert, and oriented.  His heart was of regular rate and rhythm.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His sternal
incision was clean, dry, and intact.  His sternum was stable.
His abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended.  +1 edema
was noted in his extremities.

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-8-14**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS - The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The ascending aorta is markedly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. A mobile
density originating from the right sinus of Valsalva is seen in
the ascending aorta, transverse arch and descending thoracic
aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. POSTBYPASS - LV systolic function remains normal. There is
a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. There is mild valvular AI. A graft appears in the
ascending aorta and transverse arch. The disection flap is still
present in the distal arch and descending thoracic aorta. Flow
is visualized in the true lumen. The study is otherwise
unchanged from prebypass.
[**2142-8-15**] Renal Ultrasound: No renal arterial abnormality detected.
Normal renal arterial waveforms.
[**2142-8-19**] Head MRI: Probable chronic small vessel infarct within
the inferolateral aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7842**] was emergently brought to the operating room where
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed replacement of his ascending aorta and
subtotal arch along with aortic valve replacement. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU in critical
condition. Initially coagulopathic, he required multiple blood
products. Postoperative TEE was notable worsening pericardial
effusion with questionable signs of early tamponade. He
concomitantly had a slight decline in renal function. Renal
ultrasound showed no evidence of aortic dissection into the
renal arteries. On postoperative day two, he returned to the
operating room for re-exploration. Given prolonged period of
sedation and intubation, tube feedings were started for
nutritional support. As sedation was weaned he became extremely
agitated with question of nonpurposeful movements. Head CT scan
and MRI were obtained which did not show any large area of
territory infarct. Neurology service was consulted and
attributed his altered mental status to most likely
toxic-metablolic encephalopathy. He remained hypertensive and
continued to require Labetolol drip for adequate blood pressure
control. He also experienced postop fevers, and pan-cultures
were obtained. He was empirically started on antibiotics for
possible ventilator associated pneumonia along with positive
blood cultures. Over several days, clinical improvements were
noted. He was eventually extubated on postoperative day nine. He
was transferred to the step down floor.  He was seen in
consultation by the physical therapy service.  He was gently
diuresed.  A PICC line was placed and he was screened for rehab.
 By post-operative day 15 he was ready for discharge to rehab.

who essentially was admitted to [**Hospital6 2018**] for EP ablation.  The patient had been admitted to
[**Hospital1 **]-Gluver on [**2-10**] through [**2-24**].  The
patient complained of left heart palpitations with weakness,
dry cough, no nausea, fever, chills or vomiting.  The patient
did have a little bit of yellow mucous when social history
awoke on [**2-10**] with palpitations, notified her primary
care physician who noted [**Name Initial (PRE) **] heartrate of 180 and sent her to
the Emergency Room.  The patient did have a history of atrial
tachycardia but it had been quiescent.  The patient had a
long ventriculoperitoneal tachycardiac narrow complex at 139,
a Dopamine drip was terminated but recurred.  Sotalol and
Metoprolol was added.  Cardizem eventually was made p.o.
Blood pressure had been limiting.  On [**2-12**] ? the
patient had had surgery for repair of gastric ulcer
perforation.  Records are not available at this time
regarding that procedure.  The patient had near total gastric
outlet obstruction, silk suture closed and placement of
jejunostomy tube and gastrostomy tube.  Right internal
jugular line was placed at the same time.  It was hard to
control the patient's arrhythmias and was originally
transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**] service for EP ablation.
However, the procedure was cancelled secondary to the patient
developing a fever.  On transfer to the Medicine Intensive
Care Unit the patient denies shortness of breath, chest pain,
dizziness and was evaluated in the Medicine Intensive Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypothyroidism,
hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation treated with
Verapamil and Digoxin with no recent episodes, status post
appendectomy, depression status post total abdominal
hysterectomy, status post motor vehicle accident.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with sister, no children.  She has
five siblings.

MEDICATIONS ON ARRIVAL:
Verapamil 120 b.i.d.
Aspirin q.d.
Synthroid 100 mcg q.d.
[**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. prn
Digoxin .125 mg times one year

On transfer the patient was on:
Subcutaneous Heparin
Sotalol 80 mg b.i.d., held
Risperdal 5 mg p.o. q. h.s.
Cardizem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d., held
Synthroid 100 mcg q.d.
Protonix 40 mg q.d.
Metoprolol 50 mg q. 6 hours, held

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival at the Medicine Intensive Care
Unit the patient had a temperature of 98.2.  Pulse was in the
160s.  Blood pressure was 112/60.  Respirations 20.  Room
saturations, oxygen 95 to 98%.  The patient weighed 54.7.
General:  The patient is an elderly female in no apparent
distress, lying in bed.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination:  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx
clear.  Dry tongue.  Left pupil, round and reactive to light.
Heart examination:  Tachycardiac, 160 to 180, S1 and S2
within normal limits, clear.  Lung examination, clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Abdominal examination, tender suprapubic, midline
vertical scar incision, positive bowel sounds, erythema and
pus coming from the gastrostomy tube site.

LABORATORY DATA:  Studies at an outside hospital,
computerized tomography scan noted right greater than left
pleural effusion, ascites free air.  Bilateral renal cysts.
Electrocardiogram on [**2-25**] noted supraventricular
tachycardia, 160s, left axis deviation, scalloped 1, 2,
flatter ST waves in V2 through V6.  White count on admission
was 16, hemoglobin 13.3, hematocrit 41.3, platelet count 230,
neutrophils 85, lymphocytes 10, monocytes 2.7, eosinophils
1.1, basophils .5.  PT 12.9, PTT 25, INR 1.2.  Glucose 246,
BUN 26, creatinine .9, sodium 140, potassium 4.4, chloride
104, bicarbonate 25.  Clostridium difficile positive for
stool on [**2152-2-26**].  Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus positive at gastrostomy tube site on
[**2152-2-26**].  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus positive for urine on [**2152-2-25**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2-11**] at the outside hospital she
was in normal sinus rhythm, within normal limits.  On
[**2-17**], narrow tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia
120s to 130 with rare related ST changes.  The patient was
placed on Telemetry.  Rate was in the 180s after examination.
Repeat blood pressure noted the patient to be in 80s/40s. The
patient was then sent to the medical floor for fever workup.
Diltiazem drip was started for tachycardia.  The patient
became hypotensive.  The patient was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for treatment of hypotension and
concomitant atrial tachycardia as well as fever workup.  On
[**2152-2-27**], the patient was noted to have a right
pneumothorax, status post right internal jugular line
placement.  Chest tube was placed.  The patient was also
noted to have Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in
the urine and gastrotomy tube.  Esmolol drip and
Neosynephrine drip were started for her hypotension.  On
[**2-29**], the patient underwent the ablation procedure.
Esmolol and Amiodarone were discontinued.  The patient was
weaned off of Neosynephrine.  On [**3-1**], the patient was
taken off of pressors and was placed on maintenance fluid.
The patient was also noted to have Clostridium difficile.
The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2152-3-1**].  Chart was reviewed and the patient was seen and
examined.

In summary, the patient is an 83 year old female with
hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, atrial tachycardia,
transferred from the outside hospital status post surgical
repair for a duodenal ulcer and was sent to [**Hospital6 1760**] for EP ablation for atrial
tachycardia.  The patient was admitted to Coronary Care Unit
secondary to decreased blood pressure in the setting of
intravenous calcium channel blocker for rate control, lymph
assist and tachycardia.  Intensive Care Unit course thought a
right pneumothorax secondary to attempted internal jugular
line placement.  The patient underwent successful ablation of
atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter on [**2-28**].
Infectious disease issues included Clostridium difficile in
stool, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pyuria in
urine in the setting of Foley catheterization.  On the floor
the patient remained stable and had numerous complaints of
pain.  The patient had no cardiac events.  The patient was
placed on Flagyl for a 14 day course, 500 mg b.i.d.  The
patient was on Vancomycin intravenously 750 q. 18 for a
course of seven days.  The patient got tube feeds via the
gastrostomy tube.  The patient is to be screened for
rehabilitation to assist with placement.  The patient's
laboratory data indicated the patient was generally
hypophosphatemic and would supplement as such.  The patient's
TSH was also elevated to 25 and we would be increasing her
Synthroid dose.

77 year old female with h/o COPD on 2L nc, hypercarbic resp
failure, HTN, pulmonary nodules who was found to be unresponsive
at her nursing home.
.
Per NH records and ED report, patient found to be at her normal
baseline status (A&Ox3) around 5pm.  Approx 15-30min later, she
was found to be unresponsive, and EMS was called.  Her VS at the
time were: BP 120/60, HR 100, RR 22, 82% on 15L, FS 190. Labs
from NH [**2-10**]: UA neg ket/nit/leuk/wbc/prot, Na 145, K 4.5, CO2
45, BUN 14, Cr 0.4, Ca 9.3, Glu 81, wbc 3.8, hgb 8.5.  Of note,
per nursing home records, she is on xanax standing and trazadone
prn for anxiety.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 92.7 100 86/37 90% 10L.  Her SBP ranged
70s-200s.  Per ED report, dropped w/ propofol and fentanyl,
improved with holding of sedations.   Her pupils were thought to
be minimally reactive with some weakness on the left, so a code
stroke was called.  CTA head/neck prelim negative.  CXR
hyperinflated w/o evidence of pna/effusions.  She was intubated
in the ED given worsening AMS.  There was question of jaw
[**Last Name (LF) 110199**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given ativan for possible seizure.  Her
labs in the ED were notable for Na 150, BUN/Cr 25/0.6, K 5, HCO2
>50, WBC 13.6 (85% PMN, 2% bands), trop < 0.01; UA neg
wbc/leuk/nit, pos prot, pos granular casts; lactate 2.2.  On the
vent, her ABG was: 7.34/78/501.  She has 2piv's, vent settings:
fio2 30%, tv 400, r18.
.
Currently, patient is awake and responsive; she denies pain,
history of cough, diarrhea, dysuria, fevers.

Imaging:
[**2169-2-16**] CXR- Endotracheal tube 2.5 cm from the carina. Linear
parenchymal
opacities in the right upper lung, potentially chronic; however,
followup of this region recommended on future exams.
.
[**2169-2-16**] CTA head and neck-
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Generalized parenchymal atrophy with changes of chronic small
vessel
ischemic disease.
3. Confluent hypodensity in the central pons likely represents
additional
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, given the
such findings in other typical locations. However, possiblity of
osmotic myelinolysis (""central pontine myelinolysis"") cannot be
excluded entirely, in the appropriate clinical context.
4. Tiny, 2 mm aneurysm arising from the proximal portion of the
right
posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
5. Unremarkable CTA of the neck.
6. Prominence of superior ophthalmic veins in both orbits,
likely varices.
7. Severe emphysematous changes in the visualized lung apices
with
ill-defined nodular opacities in the right upper lobe.
Comparison with
previous (outside) cross-sectional studies, if available, is
advised.
.
[**2169-2-17**] CTA chest-
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus with suboptimal
opacification of the
left lower lobe subsegmental arteries where there is scarring;
therefore,
pulmonary embolus cannot be excluded in this region.
2. Severe emphysema.
3. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
.
TTE [**2-21**]- The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 65%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
valve prolapse is present. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.
.
CXR [**3-2**]- As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant change. Large lung volumes, moderate cardiomegaly
without pulmonary edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural
effusions. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.




Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female with h/o COPD on 2L nc, hypercarbic resp
failure, HTN, pulmonary nodules who was found to be unresponsive
at her nursing home, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
distress, found to be hypothermic in ED, hyperNa, and w/
fluctuating BPs.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Patient with COPD on 2L home
O2, w/ elevated bicarb from nursing home a week ago and likely
CO2 retainer.  Her pH suggests compensated process and elevated
bicarb suggest that her respiratory status likely has
deteriorated over a chronic period of time due to worsening
COPD.  Although CXR was not notable for PNA, CTA showed some
suggestion of retrocardiac opacities and sputum w/ Gram positive
cocci on gram stain.  PE was ruled out w/ CTA.  Patient was
treated for HCAP (vancomycin, levofloxacin and cefepime), along
with standing nebulizers.  There was difficulty controlling her
anxiety with recurrent hyperventilation on pressure support.
Initial extubation attempt on [**2-20**] failed due to tachypnea, low
minute ventilation and eventually hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  Patient was continued on HCAP coverage and started on
steroids for COPD exacerbation and marked bronchospasm on
examination.  TTE showed a moderate pericardial effusion w/o
signs of tamponade with diastolic dysfunction.  Patient
underwent IV diuresis.

A major barrier to her extubation was felt to be anxiety leading
to tachypnea, in addition to above factors.  She was tried on
multiple sedative and antipsychotics and best regiment was felt
to be clonazepam 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] (prior attempted medications w/o
significant improvement - xanax, ativan, zydis, seroquel).

Per [**Hospital1 2177**] records, baseline ABG was confirmed to be
7.33-37/70-80/39/80-100.

Patient was extubated on [**2-26**]. She tolerated this well, however
was noted to be very sensitive to hyperoxia (as during nebulizer
treatments or increased supplemental oxygen) with resultant
hypercarbia, resp. distress (requiring return to ICU though no
intubation).  This improved w/ reduction of supplemental O2. She
was restarted on antibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin,
cefepime though there was no CXR evidence of recurrent
pneumonia.  She was narrowed to levofloxacin and remained
afebrile and stable.  Her goal O2 sat should be 88-92 to prevent
resultant hypercarbia and acidosis.  Patient's Advair dosing was
increased to 500/50 and tiotropium was restarted w/ albuterol
inhalers.  Nebulizers were discontinued seondary to hyperoxia as
above.  Patient was stable on 1.5L NC at the time of discharge,
sat'ing 88-96%.  Patient will continue levofloxacin through
[**2169-3-10**] for total 8 days treatment.

# Altered mental status: Patient recieved number of sedating
medications per nursing home records, which in addition to
hypercarbia could have contributed to her mental status changes.
 Patient w/ leukocytosis and hypothermia on admission, though
infectious w/o negative.  Labs also notable for hyperNa, and
appeared volume depleted by exam.  CTA head/neck unremarkable,
and neuro exam in non-focal.  Seizure seemed unlikely given the
above factors.  No meningeal signs on exam.  Urine and blood
cultures were negative; sputum culture positive as above. Sodium
was corrected.  Much of this was felt to be due to transient
hypercarbia and benzodiazapines.  At time of discharge, patient
was alert and oriented x 3.  She was tolerated clonazepam 0.5mg
qAM and qHS.

# Bacterial pneumonia: Hypothermic in ED 92.5 and patient w/
leukocytosis.  Lactate mildly elevated.  Hypotensive in the ED,
but normotensive in ICU.  See above for further discussion.
Patient completed vancomycin and zosyn course for HCAP. On
return to the ICU, concern for RLL pneumonia, so patient was
restarted on antibiotics, vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Patient
was narrowed to levofloxacin and is now day [**5-12**], should be dosed
through [**2169-3-10**].

# COPD with exacerbation: Discontinued nebulizers secondary to
respiratory distress in setting of hyperoxia. Albuterol inhaler
as needed and daily tioptrium restarted per home regimen.
Patient is on a long steroid taper, currently 30mg po daily,
with plan to decrease weekly by 10mg (next decrease Saturday
[**2169-3-12**]).

# Pericardial effusion:  Noted on prior OSH records.  TTE here
showed moderate effusion that seemed unchanged on repeat TTE.

# HTN: Blood pressure controlled with home amlodipine and
addition of lisinopril 2.5mg po daily.

# Transitional issues:
- discontinue levofloxacin after [**2169-3-10**] (8 day course started
[**3-3**])
- goal O2 sat 88-92% (patient has been reaching this goal with
1.5L NC)
- avoid nebulizers as high flow oxygen has worsened respiratory
distress, patient is stable on albuterol inhalers and tiotropium
- patient was full code throughout admission; several family
meetings confirmed her wishes for cardiopulmonary resuscitation
if necessary

History of Present Illness:
63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC,
osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who
presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was
found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of
sedatives for intubation.  She underwent induction for
anesthesia with propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl with blood
pressure dropping from the systolic 90s to 60s.  HRs also
subsequently dropped to 30s.  She received glycopyrolate with
HRs recovering to 100s; she then received esmolol to decrease
HR.  Blood pressure currently in 80s-90s prior to transport to
MICU.  ECG showed ST depressions in V3-6.  Cardiology was
consulted in the PACU who felt that ST depressions were likely
[**1-19**] demand ischemia from hypotension.  Repeat EKGs showed
resolution of ST depressions.

RFA was postponed given her hypotension and bradycardia.  She
received a total of 2.5L LR and neosynephrine approximately
every 1/2hour for 3 doses.  She also received 1gm iv cefazolin.

.
On arrival to the MICU, pt reports feeling well.  Denies chest
pain, SOB, palpitations, lightheadedness, headache.  States that
she was in her usual state of health prior to coming in for

IMAGING
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2102-4-12**]:
PRE-PROCEDURE IMAGING: Limited unenhanced CT scan of the abdomen
which
demonstrated a macro-nodular contour of the liver with mild
segmental atrophy in segment V consistent with known cirrhosis.
The spleen is enlarged. There is no ascites. The known segment
VIII liver lesion measuring 2.1 x 1.9 cm is redemonstrated as a
hypodense lesion (2:14). The segment VI lesion is not well
appreciated on non-contrast CT. The lung bases demonstrate
bilateral dependent atelectasis and mild middle lobe
atelectasis. The heart is normal in size.

PROCEDURE:

The procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed
with the
patient and written informed consent was obtained during a
preprocedure
interventional radiology consultation. The consent was reviewed
prior to the procedure. A preprocedure timeout was performed
discussing the planned
procedure, confirming the patient's identity with three
identifiers, and
reviewing a checklist per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.

Under ultrasound guidance, an entrance site was selected and the
skin was
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

The patient underwent induction of general anesthesia for the
procedure.
After prepping the patient, and prior to beginning the
procedure, the anesthesiologist noted ST depression on the
monitor and the procedure was put on hold. A 12-lead EKG was
performed, and based upon these findings, a stat cardiology
consult was requested. The procedure was terminated, and general
anesthesia was reversed.

For information on general anesthesia course/medications
administered, please see anesthesia notes. For further
information regarding the cardiac event, please see cardiology
consultation and inpatient medical records.

IMPRESSION:

Cancelation of ultrasound/CT-guided radiofrequency ablation
secondary to
cardiac event during induction of general anesthesia. Cardiology
consultation has been performed. The patient will be admitted
for observation.

PRELIMINARY REPORT***
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically-apparant flow limiting coronary
artery
disease.  The LMCA was short but widely patent.  The LAD gave
off modest
calibur diagnoals with a hinge point in D1.  The LAD had a 20%
ostial
lesion, and mild luminal irregularities leading into a 40%
proximal-mid
tubular lesion. There was a possible intramyocardial segment of
the LAD
distally, and the distal LAD wrapped around the apex. The LAD
had
slightly slow flow consistent with mild microvascular
dysfunction.  The
LCX was widely patent and supplied a large OM2, a large calibur
OM4/LPL,
a small LPL2, and a large left PDA.  There Lcx had slightly slow
flow
consistent with mild microvascular dysfunction.  The RCA was a
small and
non-dominant vessel free of angiographically-apparant flow
limiting
coronary artery disease.
2. Limted resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic
arterial blood
presure of 128/68 mmHg, and a mildly elevated LVEDP of 22 mmHg.
There
was no gradient with careful pullback across the aortic valve.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically-apparant flow limiting coronary artery
disease,
with evidence of some athersclerosis and slightly slow flow
consistent
with microvascular dysfunction.
2. Moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
3. Medical therapy for coronary artery disease with aspirin,
betablocker, statin, smoking cessasion, risk factor reduction.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC,
osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who
presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was
found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of
sedatives for intubation. Her EKG was concerning for ST
depressions in the setting of hypotension, with a troponin
elevation, so patient underwent cardiac catheterization with no
angiographical flow limiting disease.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypotension: Pt was found to be hypotensive as low as systolic
60s, likely secondary to medications for induction.  Per PACU
notes, she received propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl; she
was subsequently treated with IVFs, glycopyrrolate, and
neosynephrine with BP subsequently rising to 80s-90s.  Volume
depletion was  likely another contributing factor as pt had been
NPO since night prior to procedure and was fluid responsive in
PACU. She received additional fluid boluses in the ICU, but
still required dopamine temporarily overnight following her
procedure. She was quickly weaned off and she maintained her
blood pressure in the 90's-100's systolic afterwards.
.
# Bradycardia: This was also thought to be likely from agents
given for induction, particularly propofol and  succinylcholine.
 She also received esmolol after she became tachycardic from
glycopyrrolate.  Her bradycardia resolved over 24 hours.
.
# ST depressions: EKG showed ST depressions in lead V3-V6 that
were new from prior, in setting of bradycardia and hypotension.
Her repeat EKG later showed resolution of ST depressions.  Pt
was evaluated by cardiology who felt that ST depressions were
likely from demand ischemia from hypotension and bradycardia.
She had a troponin elevation to Trop elevated to 0.32 with mild
MB elevation to 8. Given that the patient is being evaluated for
transplantation, she underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed non significant coronary artery disease. She also had a
TTE which showed EF >55%, trace AR and MR.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HCC: Pt with HCV cirrhosis that is well-compensated (Childs
[**Doctor Last Name 14477**] A).  She has no history of jaundice, encephalopathy,
ascites, or esophageal varices.  She will need to have her RFA
rescheduled and will require an anesthesia evaluation prior to
the procedure.
.
# Osteoporosis: continued home raloxifene, calcium and vitamin D
.
# Tobacco abuse: Pt was supplied a nicotine patch while in
hospital
.
Transitional Issues:
# blood cultures were pending at time of discharge.
.
# Pt's initial chest xray was concerning for pneumonia, however
pt was clinically well and asymptomatic. No antibiotics were
started but would have low threshold to initiate treatment for
pneumonia if pt develops symptoms.
.
# Pt will need to have her RFA rescheduled. She should have a
pre-op evaluation by anesthesia to determine the safety of the
procedure.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 32687**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted for a radiofrequency ablation,
but had complications from the anesthesia so the procedure was
stopped. You required a short ICU stay for low blood pressure
and a slow heart rate. However, your blood pressure and heart
rate returned to [**Location 213**]. You had a heart catheterization to
evaluate for any blockages in the heart, and this was normal.

We have made no changes to your medications.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111746**] is a 78 year old gentleman with history significant
for hypertension who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**6-16**]
with abdominal distension, some lower abdominal pain, and blood
per rectum.  He says the blood has been alternately dark black
and bright red, but that the BRBPR has slowed significantly and
he has not had any bowel movements all day today.  His abdominal
distension is much better and he is passing gas from below, but
his lower abdominal pain is unchanged.  He had a CT scan at [**Hospital1 34**]
which revealed diverticular disease, gastrohepatic lymph nodes,
and subcentimeter hepatic
cysts, as well as gastric distension and moderate splenomegaly.
He then had an EGD which demonstrated a mass at the GE junction
that was actively bleeding.  His hematocrit was 50 on
presentation, then drifted down to 27 last night.  After a unit
of blood his repeat hematocrit was 26, at which point he
received
two more units of blood.  His Hct is now 30.

Brief Hospital Course:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 111746**] presented to the ED on [**6-19**] at [**Hospital3 **] for BRBPR.  Admission labs were notable for a Hct of
54.4 with WBC of 22.5. During his brief hospital course his Hct
continued to drop (to a low of 26) warranting a total of 3 PRBC
transfusions. The patient was evaluated by both the Oncology and
Gastroenterology teams and a upper endoscopy was performed on
hospital day 1 - notable for a large bleeding mass located in
the GE junction. Biopsies were performed and given the high
concern for malignancy the patient was prepared for transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] SICU for further management.
  Here, he was found to be hemodynamically stable.  His
hematocrit dropped from 30.9 on [**6-19**] to 24.7 on [**6-21**], so he was
transfused a unit of pRBCs.  His hematocrit stabilized and he
was transferred to the floor.  On [**6-22**], he underwent a
colonoscopy to evaluate for a lower GI bleed given his initial
presentation.  The colonoscopy showed dark melenic-appearing
stool in the whole colon and terminal ileum, non-bleeding
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, non-bleeding internal
hemorrhoids, and otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and
terminal ileum.  He tolerated the procedure well.  On [**6-23**], the
foley was discontinued, but the patient failed to void and
required reinsertion.  Also, an endoscopic ultrasound was
attempted but failed due to patient agitation.  The patient
apparently had an undocumented drug side effect of the
lorazepam, which resulted in two code purples being called.
Throughout the entire time, the patients vital signs were within
normal limits and stable, including oxygen saturation (once the
measurement was obtainable - originally the patient was refusing
pulse ox).  The patient was discharged on [**6-24**] in stable
condition with a leg bag in place.  His daughter declined our
offer to schedule him with a nearby urologist to follow up on
the leg bag because they live in [**Location (un) 5087**].  She was informed that
it is very important, therefore, that he follow up with his PCP
quickly to get a referral to a urologist in Hindham to manage
the leg bag.  Mr. [**Known lastname 111746**] was discharged in stable condition.

Chief Complaint:
atrial flutter

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
atrial flutter ablation, intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old patient with a PMH of DMII, HTN, MI
([**2135**])and history of persistent atrial fibrillation for several
years. He is s/p atrial fibrillation ablation in [**5-23**] and had
recurrent atrial flutter post procedure which required 2 DCCV??????s
in [**8-22**]. He again was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13177**] for an episode of
Atrial Flutter and was cardioverted in [**7-24**]. Although he feels
reletively well in atrial flutter he has noticed a decrease in
exercise tolerance due to shortness of breath. He used to be
able to walk one mile but in the last 2 months his exercise
tolerance has decreased to unable to climb 1 flight of stairs.
He also experiences lightheadedess when bending over when he is
in atrial flutter. Since the patient was becoming more
sympomatic he was scheduled to undergo elective ablation.
.
During the procedure, initial BP was 168/109 (baseline). He got
etomidate and succ for intubation, followed by fentanyl and
midazolam. The procedure went well and his atrial flutter
converted to NSR. Immediately after conversion, patient became
hypotensive to 70/50. Stat echo showed mildly depressed EF
without signs of tamponade. He was started on phenylephrine
briefly which was quickly weaned prior to arrival in CCU. He was
extubated without difficulty prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the CCU patient is in NAD, alert and animated. No
SOB, CP, dizziness, or nausea and vomiting.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion,
ankle edema, and palpatations. However there is absence of chest
pain.

.
# Rhythm: He was admitted for elective ablation.  The procedure
went well from a rhythm standpoint and his atrial flutter
converted to NSR.
.
In the CCU, he was monitorred on telemetry overnight and
remained in NSR.  Metoprolol was decreased to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]. [**Doctor Last Name **] of
Hearts monitorring was arranged prior to discharge, and he was
instructed to follow up with his cardiologist in 5 days.
.
The patient was therapeutically anticoagulated upon admission
and will continue his outpatient dose of warfarin with INR
monitorring upon discharge.
.
# Hypotension: Patient chronically hypertensive. Baseline SBP
160s-180s. During the procedure, initial BP was 168/109
(baseline). He got etomidate and succinylcholine for intubation,
followed by fentanyl and midazolam.  Immediately after reversion
to NSR, patient became hypotensive to 70/50. Stat echo showed
mildly depressed EF without signs of tamponade. He was started
on phenylephrine briefly which was quickly weaned. He was
extubated without difficulty and transferred to the CCU.  He had
no further episodes of hypotension.  In the CCU BPs were
100-140s systolic.  His home ACEI and metoprolol were restarted.

# Coronaries: Patient experienced a questionable MI in [**2135**] for
which he was cath and demonstrated 50% occlusion of an unknown
vessel.  Given that history, ASA was started.  He will discuss
whether it is appropriate to continue this with his
cardiologist.  ACEI and beta blocker were continued.  He was
noted to have been unable to tolerate statins secondary to
myalgias.
.
# Pump: Unknown EF.  Apparently euvolemic.  Lasix was continued
at home dose.
.
# Type II DM: Last HBA1C was 8.3%.  FS were initially 200s-300s
immediatley after procedure but well controlled subsequently.
Home insulin pump regimen was continued.
.
# Asthma:  No active disease.  Advair was continued

Chief Complaint:
GI bleeding, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p central line placement


History of Present Illness:
68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and gout who is
being treated on the biologics service with IL-2 for metastatic
melanoma.  He began the protocol on Monday and had been
tollerating the TID IL-2 infusions, but had a decline in his
plts from 200 to 56 as well as a 11# weight gain attributed to
capillary leak.  He also had significant electrolyte imbalances,
tachycardia, and tachypnea expected from this protocol.
   On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, patient had some mild epigastric
discomfort and complained to his daughter of heartburn.  Of
note, he was on daily indocin while on IL-2 therapy.  At 10pm,
he developed some diarrhea and then had an episode of nausea and
vomiting.  The covering MD noted 2 very large blood clotts in
the emesis.  Noted increased RR of 40s, was 84% on RA and then
improved to 100% on 4L NC.  Biologics attending was not
concerned about other parameters, but was worried abt bleeding
as patient may be at risk for bleeding given his plts have
dropped in the past few days.
  Brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GI team asks for FFP, plts.  Pt has guiac
positive brown stools, but complains of hemorrhoids and some
rectal irritation that may be contributing.  Holding on NG
lavage unless patient becomes unstable.  First two hcts are
stable.

Past Medical History:
Onc Hx per OMED notes:
Pt was diagnosed with melanoma in [**4-/2167**] when he was found to
have a mole on his left abdomen.  He underwent wide local
excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy at that time which
revealed no residual melanoma and the 3 sentinel nodes were
negative.  Two years later in [**4-18**], he developed a red raised
nodule under the scar of the local excision.  This was reexcised
and he subsequently did well until [**8-/2169**] when he had another
satellite recurrence and reexcision.  He then had a third
satellite recurrence and reexcision in [**10/2169**] and was then
started on interferon therapy that was stopped [**2-15**] side effects.
Recent PET/CT done revealed a left axillary lymphadenopathy as
well as 2 liver lesions.

[**2170-3-31**]
CHEST XR: A single AP supine view is compared to previous
examination earlier from the same day. Again seen extensive
bilateral parenchymal opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.
There is more dense consolidation in left lower lobe with air
bronchogram, compatible with pneumonia. There is a new
endotracheal tube with the tip overlying T3.
.
[**2170-4-2**]
BILATERAL LE DOPPLER
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
.
ECHO [**2170-4-2**]: EF>60%
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.

2. Two hypoechoic liver lesions likely corresponding to the
lesions seen on CT. Metastatic disease to the liver is within
the differential.
.
[**2170-4-9**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-2**] and 24:
Left lower lobe consolidation is clearing, probably resolving
atelectasis. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present but edema
has not returned. Azygous distention indicates volume overload.
Heart size is top normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and
a nasogastric tube passes through the mid stomach and out of

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, [**2170-3-29**], patient
had some mild epigastric discomfort and complained to his
daughter of heartburn. Of note, he was on daily indocin while on
IL-2 therapy. At 10pm, he developed some diarrhea and then had
an episode of nausea and vomiting. The covering MD noted 2 very
large blood clots in the emesis. Noted increased RR of 40s, was
84% on RA and then improved to 100% on 4L NC. Biologics
attending was not concerned about other parameters, but was
worried about bleeding as patient may be at risk for bleeding
given his plts have dropped in the past few days.
.
Brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GI team requested FFP, plts. Pt has guiac
positive brown stools, and complained of hemorrhoids and some
rectal irritation that may be contributing. He was not scoped
emergently that night, and his vitals were closely followed,
along with Hct.  His Hct was noted to be stable, with stable VS,
and no episodes of melena.  GI felt no emergent need for EGD.
He is receiving PPI [**Hospital1 **].  On [**4-1**], the pt was intubated for
respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema thought to be
secondary to capillary leak syndrome from HD IL-2.  He underwent
diuresis and was started on levo/flagyl for ?LLL PNA, started
[**3-31**].  On [**4-3**], levo/flagyl d/c'd as all cx negative, pt
afebrile.  Another reason abx d/c'd was b/c pt developed a rash
thought to be a drug hypersensitivity reaction, which improved
post d/c abx.  ID was consulted [**4-4**] for continued fevers and
recommended the initiation of broad spectrum abx incl.
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl (stopped [**4-8**]), RUQ US to r/o
cholangitis (b/c pt had elev LFTs), and stated would not give
steroids, and would do bronchoscopy/BAL for most likely pulm
source.  Chest CT demonstrated b/l lower lobe infiltrates c/w
pulm edema vs. PNA.  Pt underwent Bronch [**4-5**], showing limited
eval of right sided airways, lavage with RLL post segment,
result: no PMN, no microorg, grew OP flora, PCP negative, AFB
negative.  Vancomycin was continued for ? line infection, and
b/c the pt had difficult access, his line was continued for 19
days.  He has been on Vanco for 8 days. The pt's LFT elevation
was attributed to IL-2 therapy, a known side effect.
.
Also, he was noted to have renal insufficiency, with Cr to 1.6,
and eosinophilia, with presumed AIN.  His creatinine continued
to rise to 2.6 (baseline 0.9).  He was given prednisone, which
was subsequently d/c'd.  Renal was consulted [**2170-4-5**] and
recommended for pt to increase free water intake.  They felt he
had a number of reasons to have ARF, including: capillary leak
syndrome, NSAIDs, infection, contrast on [**4-2**], and drug reaction
though no eos or WBC in urine.  The pt's creatinine demonstrated
slow improvement, was 1.4 [**4-7**], and on transfer from ICU, his Cr
was 0.9 (baseline).
.
Subjectively on transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the medical floor, the pt
felt well, is laughing and joking with family, and has no pain
complaints.  States his breathing if fine.  No cough, fever,
chills.  No N/V.  No abd pain.  No diarrhea or constipation.  No
dysuria.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.

________________________________________________________________
Impression:  A/P: 69 M with metastatic melanoma s/p IL-2
therapy, last dose at 3 pm [**3-29**], now with fevers, resp failure
[**2-15**] non-cardiogenic pulm edema; now improving, extubated [**4-12**],
and satting well on NC.  Resolved ARF.  s/p Drug
hypersensitivity reaction with discontinuation of all
antibiotics and improvement.
.
#. Pulmonary status s/p respiratory distress: Mr. [**Known lastname 64730**] was
intubated initially [**3-31**] for resp distress, thought secondary to
non-cardiogenic pulm edema from capillary leak syndrome from
Il-2, with possible contribution from PNA. LLL inbfiltrate on
CXR, fevers, but sputum never grew anything, so unclear if PNA
vs atalectasis. He was intially started on levaquin and flagyl.
Chest CT showed lower lobe infiltrates c/w pulm edema vs PNA.
Lenis were neg, but he did not have a CTA because of renal
failure. He has no h/o CHF, COPD or asthma. No Echo on file. The
pt was then taken off all abx on [**4-11**] because all cx data was
negative and fevers seemed likely due to acute interstitial
nephritis given eosinophilia, ARF, rash versus due to his
melanoma and IL'2 treatment. ID was consulted, recommended
bronchoscopy and labs, empiric sntibiotics for presumed Hospital
acquired PNA vs. line infection, so he was started on
vancomycin. Bronchoscopy from [**4-5**] was negative. He remained on
vancomycin for 8 days until his central line was pulled.  We
then discontinued Vancomycin IV.
-now on room air, sats stable
-nebs prn if needed
-chest PT, mobilize secretions
-IS to bedside and encourage pt to use
.
# ARF, resolved: this was thought to be acute interstitial
nephritis given fever, rash and ARF with peripheral
eosinophilia. However, eos negative in urine. Renal consulted
felt to be pre-renal also question contrast induced nephropathy.
This fully resolved with hydration, so finally appeared to be
most likely pre-renal and contrast related.  His creatinine
continued to be at his baseline.  We ended up restarting his
outpatient ACEI.  Will see PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week.
.
# Fever: Unclear etiology still, all cultures negative. He has
been hemodynamically stable. ID was consulted in the setting of
contemplating starting steroids.  ID recomended to r/o infection
BAL prior to starting empiric antibiotics, multiples serologies
histoplasma antigen, EBV viral load, CMV viral load, cryptococal
antigen, Strongiloides serology. RUQ u/s. All work up
unrevealing to date, and fevers tapered off. Afebrile for 6 days
prior to leaving ICU. Initial empiric a/b regimen with flagyl,
aztreonam and vanco was D/C'd .  He has remained afebrile on the
medical floor and has been instructed to report to the ED for
fever, chills.
.
#. Hypernatremia, resolved: Likely due to increase insensible
lossess. Free water boluses and D5w was given with normalization
of sodium.
.
#. ?Line infection:  Pt was continuing to spike fevers in the
ICU with a negative panculture workup and no infiltrate.  Other
sources excluded, so IV vamco empirically given.   His line was
pulled, no drainage and erythema at site.  His blood cx are
negative to date.  We stopped IV vancomycin on transfer to
medical floor, no evidence to support its use.
.
#. Metastatic Melanoma:  Il-2 therapy on hold for now. Plan per
Onc team, attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **].  His restaging lung
CT, head CT showed only mediastinal nodes largest 1.7 cm, could
not assess for pulm nodules given pulm edema.  The pt has follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#. GI Bleed:  The pt had emesis with large clots on [**3-28**]. No
further bleeding, hct has since remained stable stable. The pt
can continue his PPI.  His Hct has remained stable, as well as
his vital signs.
.
#. Elevated LFTs: stable.  This is a known side effect of IL-2
therapy.  We held his IL-2, and trended his LFTs, which improved
over time.
.
#  Confusion/ICU psychosis:  Pt had vivid dreams as well as
hallucinations while in the ICU, and would often speak
inappropriately at times or answer questions with responses
unrelated.  He was started on low dose haldol.  On the medical
floor, the pt was appropriate in conversation, but would
occasionally state things that he was going to ""[**Country 4194**] to herd
cattle.""  On questioning his family, they stated that he has no
plans for a trip.  He is otherwise appropriate.  He has an
appointment to follow up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week. His haldol was
not given while he was on the medical floor.
.
#. Communication: with pt, wife and daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64731**]
.
#. Nutrition:
The pt initially failed his speech and swallow study, however
the study was done a few hours post extubation, when the pt
still had copious secretions.  At the time of transfer to the
medical floor, the pt was swallowing and chewing fine.  He did
not experience any choking or coughing episodes with eating, and
he is tolerating a po diet well.  We did not repeat his swallow
study.  He does not appear to be an aspiration risk now.
.
#. Access: RSC multi-lumen [**3-26**] discontinued, now with pIV
.
#. Code: full
.
#. Proph: PPI, pneumoboots, heparin sq tid
.
#. Dispo: Home with physical therapy services. Follow up with
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has a CAT scan scheduled for the last week in [**Month (only) 547**],
followed by a Heme/Onc appt on [**5-16**].

T-spine CT ([**11-1**]):
1.  Large mass involving the posterior elements at the level of
T9 on the left which is invading the central canal and causing
thecal sac compression.
2.  Multiple masses in the lung consistent with metastases.
Findings were discussed with you the day of the study.

L-spine CT ([**11-1**]):
1.  Congenitally narrowed central spinal canal as described
above.  Mild degenerative changes at L4-5 with a diffuse
broad-based disc bulge.  There is no evidence for neural
foraminal narrowing.
2.  No bony lesions are identified to indicate metastatic isease
in the lumbar spine.  Please see thoracic spine report of the
same date for significant findings regarding likely metastatic
disease.

Chest CT ([**11-1**]):
1.  Numerous bilateral soft tissue density pulmonary nodules
consistentwith pulmonary metastases. Given the history of prior
nephrectomy, metastatic renal cell carcinoma is likely.
2.  Destructive osseous lesion in the T9 vertebral body with
encroachment upon the spinal canal.  Urgent Neurosurgery consult
and further characterization with dedicated MRI is required.
3.  Coronary artery calcifications.

History of Present Illness:
65F with history of sciatica and chronic low back pain,
presenting to [**Hospital3 10310**] hospital with worsening back pain,
now admit to MICU with altered mental status, renal failure and
multiple epidural abcesses.  She began to feel ill one week ago
when she acutely felt ""awful"" with low-grade fevers, back pain
and thought she had the flu.  She went to the ED, where she was
treated with ibuprofen, Vicodin and Tamiflu.  She stayed home
for the rest of the week resting her back, until the pain
worsened on Friday and she went to see her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
diagnosed with sciatica and sent home with Percocet.  Over
Saturday and Sunday she became increasingly somnolent, sleeping
excessively and refusing to eat.  Initially she would still
drink water through a straw, but stopped doing that Sunday.  Her
husband called the [**Name (NI) **] for advice, and was told to call 911.  She
had not complained specifically of headaches and he did not
notice photophobia or neck stiffness.  She may have been
urinating less, but did not complain of dysuria.

EMS arrived to find her supine on the couch complaining of back
pain.  In the OSH ED her VS were T 99.6, HR 120, BP 132/68, 91%
on RA.   Given ceftriaxone, flagyl, clindamycin, and vancomycin.
 Episode of transient tachycardia to 120s that resolved with
fluids.  Found to have new ARF, a positive UA and leukocytosis
to 20K with 14% bands.  No imaging done there before she was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T97.9 HR103 113/76 R30 98% on
RA.  She was very somnolent and confused speech when awoken.
Noted to have pustular and petichial rash over torso and lower
extremities.  Difficult neurologic exam given cooperation.  Head
CT normal.  MRI performed that was concerning for multiple
diffuse epidural collections on a noncontrast scan limited
somewhat by motion.  Spine service was consulted, who reviewed
MRI and felt no spine compression - no surgical intervention
right now.  Lactate elevated.  She received vanco, ceftriaxone,
and was supposed to get ampicillin and acyclovir, which did not
happen prior to transfer.  Did not LP given concern for epidural
collections.  Blood cultures drawn (others pending at OSH) and
heme/onc consulted out of concern for TTP.

On the floor, she is somnolent but arousable and does open her
eyes.  She grimaces on movement of any of her extremities but
does not speak.  Will answer yes if asked if she has pain but
does not speak.
.

[**10-15**] MRI spine:
Multifocal small epidural collections as detailed above,
predominantly in the thoracic spine. No significant cord
compression is noted at any level.
Etiology for these collections could include infection or
hematomas.
Appearance is not suggestive of neoplasm, although correlation
with CSF
evaluation would be recommended.Evaluation is limited due to
lack of
contrast. Extensive degenerative changes in the lumbar spine
with clumping of nerve roots at L5-S1.
.
[**10-15**] CT head:
No acute intracranial process.
.
[**10-15**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
No evidence of hydronephrosis or obstructive renal calculi.
Given
noncontrast technique, pyelonephritis cannot be excluded.
Recommend clinical correlation.
.
[**10-16**] Echo:
No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular
disease seen (reasonable-quality study). Normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of
vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude
endocarditis.
.
[**10-17**] CXR:
Findings suggestive interval worsening of mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema; chronic interstitial lung disease may be
present.
.
[**10-20**] MRI Spine:
Overall no significant change compared to the previous study
with
the exam limited by motion. Severe degenerative changes are
identified with foraminal narrowing as above. The previously
noted tiny epidural collection at L5-S1 level is not apparent
but mild epidural enhancement is seen. No definite new
collection is identified.
.
[**10-20**] MRI Head:
No significant abnormalities on MRI of the brain with and
without
gadolinium.
.
[**10-21**] CT Pelvis:
1) No evidence of right hip infection or abscess. Note that MRI
or
radionuclide bone scan are more sensitive for the detection of
early
infection.
2) Diffuse anasarca.
.
[**10-25**] EMG/NCS:
Complex, abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings are
consistent with
a severe, subacute multilevel polyradiculopathy involving
cervical and
lumbosacral myotomes diffusely and would be consistent with
either an
inflammatory/infectious meningeal process. The abnormalities are
most
pronounced in the midcervical region. In addition, there is
evidence for a superimposed neuromyopathy, as may be seen in
acute quadriplegic myopathy of intensive care.

[**10-30**] C-Spine Non-Trauma:
Five intraoperative radiographs of cervical spine with final
images showing both anterior and posterior fusion extending from
C4 through T1 posteriorly and C5 through T1 anteriorly. There is
an interbody anterior graft at C5-6 and apparently C7 body has
been partially replaced by a metallic device.
.
[**10-31**] MRI Head:
1. No acute infarction or hemorrhage.
2. Sinus disease as described above, the activity of which is to
be
determined clinically.
3. Enhancing fluid within the left temporalis region suggestive
of phlegmon. This enhancing collection previously demonstrated
restricted diffusion. Additional subcutaneous scalp fluid
collections in the bilateral parietal regions may represent soft
tissue edema; however, there is no evidence of enhancement to
suggest abscess.
.
[**10-31**] MRI L Spine:
1. New posterior epidural abscess extending from the level of
L4-L5 to the
level of S2 with phlegmonous extension into the paravertebral
and paraspinous musculature. No evidence of enhancing
intervertebral discs to suggest discitis.
2. Advanced degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, unchanged
since the
previous examination.
.
[**11-1**] MRI T spine:
1. Epidural abscesses are identified at the upper thoracic spine

involving the levels of T1, T2, and T3, apparently slightly
smaller since the prior examination, however, there is
persistent enhancement surrounding the thecal sac and the spinal
cord.
2. No evidence of abnormal signal within the thoracic spinal
cord.
3. Epidural abscess is again demonstrated at the level of T7/T8,
causing
anterior thecal sac deformity and also demonstrating pattern of
enhancement.
4. Heterogeneous signal is again redemonstrated in the bone
marrow, likely
consistent with a combination of osteomyelitis/discitis.
5. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**11-2**] XR L-Spine:
Single intraoperative radiograph performed without a radiologist
present.
These demonstrate the lower lumbar spine. At the lumbosacral
junction,
instrumentation is demonstrated. Background degenerative change
is
demonstrated in the remainder of the lumbar spine in the single
intraoperative radiograph. For full details of surgery, please
consult the operative report.
.
[**11-9**] MRI SPINE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent multiloculated small epidural abscess anterior to
the thecal
sac at the L5-S1 level measuring up to 2 cm in the SI dimension
and
compressimg the thecal sac at this level.
2. Markedly improved epidural abscesses at C5 through T1, T3-T4
and
posteriorly at L4-L5. Fluid collections in the resection bed
within the
cervical and lumbar spine may be postoperative, though infection
cannot be
excluded.
3. Persistent multifocal abnormal bone marrow signal
abnormality, consistent
with extensive osteomyelitis.
4. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**11-9**] right upper extremity ultrasound:
1. Fibrin sheath identified around PICC line in the right
basilic vein. The
fibrin sheath does not extend beyond the basilic vein.
2. No deep venous thrombosis identified in right upper limb.
.
[**11-12**] Ultrasound:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the common
femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed
bilaterally. Normal
compressibility, flow, waveform, and augmentation demonstrated.
No
intraluminal thrombus is identified. Subcutaneous edema is noted
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No lower extremity deep venous thrombosis
bilaterally.




Brief Hospital Course:
#. MSSA infection (including epidural abscesses/vertebral
osteo/meningitis/bacteremia/skin lesions/UTI): Pt found to have
MSSA from blood and also grew MSSA from urine.  Vancomycin was
started, then switched to Nafcillin when the organism was
identified. TTE was performed and showed no vegetations. It is
unknown what the portal of entry for the MSSA was. The
bacteremia, skin lesions and UTI resolved with appropriate
antibiotic therapy. Ortho spine was consulted and recommended
serial imaging to determine whether epidural abscesses were
increasing in size or causing spinal cord compression. Pt got
MRIs approximately once a week and on the 3rd it was more clear
that the patient would require surgery. She underwent
neurosurgery [**10-30**] and for epidural abscess drainage (and C7
corpectomy, C4-T1 fusion, T3-4 laminectomy).  Multiple abscesses
present (~5, with 3 major ones), hardware place, cultures sent,
debrided.  Upon repeat imaging post operatively, MRI showed
expanding T-spine epidural abscess, so she then underwent L
spine decompression [**11-2**] with debridement.  Per ID, Gentamycin
was added to help with Nafcillin penetration for a 5-day course,
which was completed on [**11-6**]. Pt will continue on nafcillin for
at least 8 weeks and will follow up with spine and ID.  Her
tentative stop date for nafcillin is [**2187-12-29**], or it may be
stopped on [**12-14**] when she visits ID.  She has an appointment with
Spinal surgery on [**2186-12-27**].  she will need to have her staples
removed on [**2187-11-23**] in rehab with log role [**Last Name (LF) 10313**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Spine
surgery. She is to have weekly [**First Name3 (LF) **] draws faxed to the Infectious
Disease Physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
#Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: treated for HAP with vancomycin
and cefepime from [**11-11**] through [**11-18**].  Her nafcillin was
stopped during this treatment and was restarted on [**11-19**].
.
#. Altered mental status: The patient was initially minimally
responsive. This was thought to be secondary to meningitis as
well as the severity of her infection. This resolved
substantially with antibiotics. She did remain minimally
delerious throughout her stay (generally oriented x3 with
moments of confusion). MRI head was normal.
.
# Weakness: As pt's mental status improved and she became
cooperative with  neuro exam, it became clear that she had
diffuse weakness with some focality (especially R arm) with
sensation relatively intact. Neurology was consulted who felt
that some of the weakness could be [**12-25**] cord inflammation and so
pt recieved pulsed steroids early in her admission without
significant effect. Pt underwent EMG which showed a mixed
picture (see EMG report for full details). Pt did undergo
decompression on [**10-30**] and [**11-2**] but strength remained similar.
.
#. GI Bleed:  On [**2187-10-28**] pt developed melanotic stools and a
hematocrit drop from 24 to 20. IV PPI was continued and she
recieved 1U of prbcs and had an EGD which showed severe
ulcerations in stomach and duodenum most consistent with nsaid
use (pt did use ibuprofen at home). Per pt she had had a normal
colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 112**] 4 yrs ago and this was not repeated as an
inpt. Pt also reports h/o duodenal ulcers in the [**2147**]. An h
pylori was sent and was positive. Treatment of h pylori was
deferred in setting of nafcillin therapy and severe infection.
Pt was continued on PPI, eventually  transitioned to PO. Pt will
need 2 week course of amoxicillin and clarithromycin after her
nafcillin treatment is complete (nafcillin does not cover h
pylori.)
She should continue lansoprazole until her visit with the
Gastroenterologist in [**Month (only) 404**].
.
#. Persistent Sinus Tachycardia: Pt maintained HR of ~100
throughout her admission (~1 month). This was felt to most
likely be related to her severe underlying infection and
recurrent low grade fevers. Intravascular volume depletion was
also a likely contributor given pt's low albumin and anasarca
and clinical appearance of being dry (dry mouth, low JVP). PE
was considered, however, pt was on DVT ppx throughout admission
and EKG did not have any changes. Further, pt's oxygen
requirement was minimal to none and ultimately it was decided
that PE was highly unlikely. Also given her prolonged stay may
be a PE, though this is less likely.
.
#. Edema: Patient was noted to have anasarca and an albumin of
1.9. Pt was not diuresed aggressively as she appeared
intravascularly depleted and had minimal oxygen requirement. Her
edema improved upon discharge.
.
#. Anemia: Pt remained anemic throughout her stay. Perhaps she
has had ulcers for some time contributing to her anemia. Her
reticulocyte count was 6.7 arguing against marrow suppression as
the etiology, however, iron studies were consistent with anemia
of chronic disease. The transfusion goal was set at 22. She
recieved 2U of PRBCs throughout her stay.
.
#. Pain: Patient had severe back pain throughout her admission
that was ultimately treated with a fentanyl patch with small
boluses of IV morphine for breakthrough pain. A kanair bed was
also found to help with her pain.
.
#. Rash: On admission pt had 2 rashes. She had diffuse small
pustules which grew MSSA and resolved c antibiotics. She also
had, on the left back, a 4 x 3cm erythematous plaque with a
central brown / black, rough, necrotic area which was biopsied
by dermatology and showed ""Focal necrotizing vasculitis in
mid-dermis with focal thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis of
epidermis and appendages"" which dermatology felt was consistent
with a reactive process, rather than representing a primary
vasculitis, given the clinical scenerio.
.
#. Acute renal failure: Pt had [**Last Name (un) **] on admission, which resolved
c IVF.
.
#. Elevated transaminases: Pt had elevated LFTs on admission,
most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of dehydration or
billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  RUQ ultrasound
unremarkable. This was trended and resolved.
.
#. Thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemia
was concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC on
admission, however no chistocytes on smear.  Most likely due to
poor production in the setting of infection and resolved during
admission.
.
#. Nutrition: she failed speech and swallow on [**11-12**].  A
percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube was placed on [**11-15**] and tube
feeds continued.
.
# Electrolyte Abnormalities: Patient had persistent hypokalemia
and hypophosphatemia. Standing electrolyte orders were instilled
and should be continued in rehab until levels normalize. Also, a
Chem-10 should be checked every other day while taking these
medications.

#. Access: Patient has a PICC placed in the right arm on
[**2187-10-19**].

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
MSSA epidural abscesses, MSSA meningitis and vertebral
osteomyelitis and discitis, MSSA UTI, MSSA bacteremia, MSSA
diffuse skin pustules, profound weakness. dysphagia. anasarca.
duodenal and gastric ulcers complicated by bleeding.


Discharge Condition:
Vital signs stable. very weak legs and R arm more swollen than L
arm, but very diffuse weakness. anasarca. intermittently
confused.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a bacterial infection of your spinal
fluid and the bones of your spine as well as your urine and
blood and skin. You were treated with antibiotics and the
orthopedic surgeons did two surgeries to take out the abscesses.


You also had a lot of weakness, for which we had neurology see
you. They felt that your weakness was due to a combination of
factors including the infection around your spine and also some
muscle weakness from being so weak. You worked extensively with
physical therapy and will continue to do so at rehab.
.
You were having difficulty swallowing as well, thought secondary
to pharyngeal inflammation from your cervical spine surgery and
muscle weakness from prolonged hospitalization.  You therefore
had a gastrojejunostomy tube placed to receive nutrition.
.
You will need to wear the cervical collar until you meet with
the spine surgeons on [**2187-12-27**]. You have staples on
your back. These will need to be removed [**2187-11-23**]. We spoke with
the spine surgeons and they stated your facility can remove
these under log role precautions.
.
You will need to continue nafcillin until at least [**2187-12-28**],
unless the Infectious Disease specialists tell you otherwise at
your appointment on [**2187-12-14**].

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 75 year old woman on Coumadin and
Plavix, s/p mechanical MVR, h/o GI bleed (ten years ago), now
presenting with black tarry stools overnight, with 2 additional
episodes of melena this morning. Pt was seen in urgent care at
PCP's office today and was guaiac positive. In PCP office she
noted three black tarry stools. During this time, she has no
nausea, vomiting, no epigastric pain, no lightheadedness, and no
chest pain. She has not taken any  over-the-counter medications.
She usually takes MiraLax has a bowel movement every few days,
and she has had three bowel movements in less than 24 hours. The
patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease diagnosed in the
mid 90s. She has been maintained on ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. for

recommended NG lavage, which showed brown effluent, no coffee
grounds. Following NGT placement the pt developed brisk
epistaxis, now has packing in place. Repeat hct stable at 40.
Major source of bleeding is now iatrogenic nosebleed. Vitals on
transfer were: 96.4 HR 97 127/63 19 100%RA.

Pertinent Results:
EGD [**2188-10-22**]: Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Mild erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis
Erythema in the stomach body compatible with NG tube-induced
trauma
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
During this procedure, we did not find activate bleeding.
Small hiatal hernia
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Because we did not identify the etiology of her
G.I. bleeding during this procedure, she might need colonoscopy
to rule out right colonic bleeding. We will discuss with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2987**] this afternoon to recommend either regular colonoscopy or
virtual colonoscopy.

Colonoscopy [**2188-10-23**]: Angioectasia in the cecum (thermal
therapy)
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: In patient care
Capsule endoscopy. Serial hematocrits

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 75 year old woman on Coumadin and Plavix,
s/p mechanical MVR, h/o GI bleed (ten years ago), now presenting
with GI bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, c/b
nasal bleeding following NGT placement.
.
# GI Bleed: The pt had three melenotic stools over 24 hrs, but
has stable hct on labs and is otherwise asymptomatic (without
fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion, chest pain, or
orthostasis). NG lavage was negative for any coffee ground
material or bloody contents. EGD did not reveal any source of
bleed. The patient also underwent colonoscopy, revealing a
bleeding AVM, which was coagulated using thermal therapy. She
will need a capsule endoscopy as an out-patient in order to
assess for additional, non-visualized AVM in the small bowel.
She was monitored with serial hematocrits, which trended
downward precipitating transfusion with 1 unit of blood. Her
anti-coagulation with Plavix and Coumadin was held for her
procedures. After, she was re-started on coumadin with a heparin
bridge to therapeutic INR, and her plavix was restarted after
being held for 7 days.  Her hematocrit was stable at discharge.
She was discharged once INR was therapeutic.
.
# Nasal trauma: Following NGT placement, pt developed bleeding
from nose that was quite profuse. Packing was placed by ENT
which was dislodged overnight. We suspect that a minor
lac/contusion from NG tube in the setting of elevated INR
precipitated this event. She experienced no further epistaxis
during this admission.
.
# Mechanical MV replacement: Goal INR is 2.5-3.5. The patient is
on a higher dose of Coumadin (5.5mg) to maintain this INR. Per
discussion with cardiology, her anti-coagulation was not
reversed. All anticoagulation was held pending her EGD, and she
was started on a heparin drip afterwards. After her colonoscopy,
she was restarted on Coumadin and a heparin drip was used to
bridge the patient until her INR was therapeutic. At discharge,
her INR was 2.6.
.
# CAD s/p 1 vessel CABG [**2177**]: The patient's beta blocker was
initially held so as not to mask hypovolemia. It was re-started
after the patient's procedures with normal heart rate and
excellent blood pressure control.
.
# TIA's (on plavix): Plavix was restarted after being held for a
total of 7 days after her colonoscopy.

Date of Birth:  [**2089-3-6**]        Sex:  F

Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old
female with a history of [**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia and cardiomyopathy
with ejection fraction of 35 percent and diastolic
dysfunction with negative catheterization, atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, and insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, who was in her usual state of health until 2-3
weeks prior to admission she had episodes of nausea and
vomiting.  The patient also noted paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and orthopnea with a 30-pound weight gain and
decreased urine output.  She was noted to have an INR of 19.5
on admission.  She was given vitamin K and admitted to the
Fennard Intensive Care Unit for concern for gastrointestinal
bleed.  The patient was also found to have nephrotic range
proteinuria and elevated LFTs.  Echocardiogram revealed
depression in her ejection fraction to 20 percent.  GI
Service was consulted and it suspected that her increasing
liver function tests were secondary to ischemic liver injury
with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension.  The
Renal Service was consulted and felt her creatinine increase
and proteinuria may be secondary to underlying diabetic
nephropathy with severe right-sided heart failure.  She was
initially started on Lasix for her uncompensated congestive
heart failure, but her creatinine rose, so she was
transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to initiate nesiritide
treatment.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 66-78,
blood pressure 125-130/82-91, respirations 20, she is
saturating 100 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Generally,
in mild respiratory distress, alert and oriented x 3.  HEENT:
Mucous membranes moist.  Obese neck.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
slightly distended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Show total body 2 plus edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 14.2, hematocrit 41.7,
platelets 417, 93 percent neutrophils, 5 percent lymphocytes,
2 percent monocytes.  Sodium 140, potassium 5.1, glucose 140,
chloride 105, bicarbonate 20, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, and
magnesium 2.  INR is 5.4 and PTT 34.3.  ALT is 915, AST
1,311.  Troponin T is 0.15, MB index is 3, MB is 12, and CK
is 397.  Alkaline phosphatase 114 and total bilirubin 3.1.

Chest x-ray on [**4-7**], shows congestive heart failure versus
bibasilar atelectasis.  Renal ultrasound shows unremarkable
left kidney, limited evaluation of the left.  No
hydronephrosis.  Normal echo texture.

Echocardiogram shows ejection fraction of 20 percent, severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe global right
ventricular and free wall hypokinesis, 3 plus TR, mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Abdominal ultrasound shows normal liver echo texture,
hepatopetal portal venous flow.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Congestive heart failure:  The patient with
non-ischemic congestive heart failure associated with
[**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia with a recent worsening of her ejection
fraction to 20 percent.  The patient had mild elevation in
her cardiac enzymes, more consistent with atrial fibrillation
and hypotension in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  These enzymes trended down and
were not consistent with myocardial infarction.  The patient
was felt to be at risk for arrhythmia secondary to her severe
congestive heart failure and would likely need pacemaker
replacement in the future.  She was started on a Natrecor
drip due to her worsening renal function with Lasix.  She was
diuresed well with the Natrecor and the Congestive Heart
Failure Service followed her while she was in the hospital.
After several days of Natrecor diuresis, she was transitioned
to Lasix, although her creatinine rose to 2.1 and therefore
her Lasix was held for 1 day and her Lasix dose was
decreased.

Atrial flutter:  The patient has evidence of sick sinus
syndrome with occasional positives and is very sensitive to
beta-blockers.  She was started on dofetilide per the
Electrophysiology Service in an attempt to convert her to
sinus rhythm to improve her congestive heart failure.  The
patient did convert to sinus rhythm on dofetilide, although
her creatinine was unstable and rose to 2.1.  Therefore,
dofetilide was considered to be a poor antiarrhythmic choice
for her.  Per the Electrophysiology Service, there were no
other antiarrhythmic options and the patient will need to
follow up for a flutter ablation and if the flutter ablation
is unsuccessful, likely AV node ablation with pacemaker
placement.

Renal:  The patient was in nephrotic range proteinuria,
likely due to diabetic nephropathy.  The patient's creatinine
during her hospitalization rose to 2.1 and her Lasix dose was
subsequently decreased.  Because of her unstable creatinine
dofetilide was felt to be a poor antiarrhythmic for her.

Elevated LFTs:  There was no clear toxic etiology for
increased LFTs.  Her hepatitis A virus IgG was positive,
although all other hepatitis serologies were negative.
Acetaminophen level was negative.  This was felt to be either
related to transient hypotension in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] versus hepatic
congestion from congestive heart failure.  During her
hospitalization, her LFTs improved.

Urinary tract infection:  The patient with a positive UA, was
treated with levofloxacin.

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus:  The patient was
followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] Service while an inpatient and started
on Lantus which was titrated up, and sliding scale insulin.

Depression:  The patient was with a history of severe
depression with suicide attempts.  She was continued on her
Paxil and during her hospitalization denied any suicidal or
homicidal ideations.

[**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia:  The patient was followed by Dr.[**Name (NI) 22985**]
team, the neurogeneticist, and initiated on coenzyme-Q
treatment while in hospital.  She will continue on this as an
outpatient and follow up with her neurologist.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home in the
care of her husband.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levothyroxine 25 mcg p.o. q.d.

Images:
[**10-7**] Chest AP: Low lung volumes with known idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis. While a subtle superimposed acute consolidation in the
lung bases is difficult to exclude, it would be highly
coincidental and is felt less likely with the increased opacity
likely due to crowding.

CXR ([**10-8**]):
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Status post sternotomy, status post valvular
replacement. The
external and internal pacemaker with leads are visible.
Unchanged evidence of a right basal opacity with a predominantly
reticular pattern, that might, in part be, fibrotic.  These are
likely to be related to the known history of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. There is no evidence of fluid overload on
the current image. No pleural effusions. No parenchymal
opacities have newly occurred.
.
CT Torso: [**10-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis with mild bibasilar
consolidations, worse on the right than the left, likely
reflecting atelectasis, although
superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
2. Status post right mastectomy.
3. Cholelithiasis in a nondistended gallbladder with mild wall
edema/pericholecystic fluid likely reflects either CHF or
hypoproteinemia.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. No evidence of intra-abdominal free air or organized fluid
collection.
6. Indistinct pancreatic head; correlate with pancreatic enzymes
if clinical concern for pancreatitis.
.
RUQ US [**10-25**]
1. Sludge and stones in the gallbladder neck without other
findings to
suggest acute cholecystitis. If there is continued clinical
concern, a HIDA scan may be more definitive in the exclusion of
acute cholecystitis.
2. Dilated hepatic veins consistent with diastolic dysfunction

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y.o woman with PMH of IPF,COPD,anemia, mechanical mitral
valve,and pacemaker presents with worsening dyspnea, acute renal
failure, and fluid overload.

#. Anemia: On admission hemoglobin of 4.6 and hematocrit of 14.2
from a
hgb 10 and hct 33.1 within the last several weeks. Hemolysis
labs negative, and rectal exam showed guiac positive brown
stool. Her anemia was believed to be secondary to a GI bleed.
She was transfused 4 units total with appropriate hct response,
and her hct/hgb ramined stable. She underwent EGD/colonoscopy
which showed esophageal and fundal varices and a large polyp in
the colon, concerning for malignancy which was believed to be
the source of bleeding.  On biopsy, this lesion was found to be
an adenoma with high grade dysplasia. Gastroenterology believed
that it would be possible to perform a transluminal resection
but that the procedure would have high risk of perforation and
death. After a goals of care discussion with the [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15155**], and the gastroenterology team
it was decided that though the adenoma is high risk for
malignancy, she will likely succumb to her severe pulmonary
disease in the next 1-5 years and removal of the mass is not in
line with her goals of care. She was started on nadolol for
esophageal varaces.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Obtain 2x weekly HCTs and transfuse for HCT <21
-- Continue Fe supplementation and epo administration
.
#. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient presented on 5L
trans-trach from a baseline of 4L at home in the setting of
known IPF, COPD, and chronic heart failure.  Her dyspnea was
attributed to anemia vs fluid overload from CHF, and remained
stable in-house and gradually improved upon discharge from the
ICU.  There was low suspicion for a COPD or IPF exacerbation.
She was given IV Torsemide for diuresis with her packed red cell
transfusions, and her home Bumex was held in-house.  Her home
prednisone and nebulizers were continued in-house.  Related to
her shortness of breath, she occassionally coughed up ""blood
balls"", which she attributed to bloodly mucous originating at
her catheter site.  These were inconsistent, and associated with
epistaxis, and we believed that there was a component of bloody
post-nasal drip contributing, exacerbated by the fact that she
was on a heparin gtt for her heart valve.  The total blood loss
from these episodes was essentially non-contributory.  On the
floor, she continued to be dyspneic at times.  She was found to
have evidence of a RUL HAP, so she was started empirically on
vancomycin and cefepime. She developed progressive respiratory
distress and returned the MICU where she was intubated. She
underwent broncheoalveolar lavage which was culture negative and
her antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-23**]. She continued to be
intermittently diuresed but it was stopped when her creatinine
bumped from 1.8 to 2.7. She was extubated and returned to the
medical floor with o2 sats 95% on 2LNC The thought is that her
respiratory distress was likely due to a mucus plug and
pulmonary edema. After two days on the medical floor, she pulled
out a nasogastric tube which had been used for tubefeeds,
aspirated and developed respiratory distress with hypoxia and
acidemia. She was transferred to the MICU for a third time where
she was again intubated. Out of concern for HCAP the pt was
started on vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]. Due to increasing wbc and decreased stool
output there was also concern for c.diff, which ultimately was
positive, and the pt was started on flagyl/PO vanc. The pt's
respiratory status improved and she was successfully extubated.
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**10-30**] with plan to complete a
total of 8d of meropenem.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Continue meropenem thru [**11-3**].
-- Ongoing discussion regarding replacement of transtracheal
catheter.
.
#Clostridium Difficile: The pt was found to have a rising WBC,
episodes of hypotension and decreased stool output. She was
empirically started on IV flagyl and PO vanco which were
continued when stool culture was positive for c.diff. Pt had
subsequent decreased in WBC to normal with improvement in loose
stools.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Plan to complete PO vancomycin 125mg PO Q6hrs as well as
Flagyl 500mg Q8hrs; end date [**11-9**].
.
#Anticoagulation: Patient anticoagulated due to presence of
mechanical valve. Patient presented with an INR of 10 for
unclear reasons.  She received 5mg PO Vit K, and her INR
down-trended to the sub-therapeutic range and she was started on
a Heparin gtt for her mechanical mitral valve.  She experienced
epistaxis and coughed up bloody mucus in the setting of a
slightly supratherapeutic PTT which resolved with decreasing her
Heparin gtt.  She was kept on a heparin drip for bridging on the
medicine floor.  When the decision was made to pursue
endomucosal resection of her adenoma, her warfarin was
discontinued, however given this was put on hold, the pt was
restarted on coumadin [**10-29**]. At time of discharge patient
remained on hep gtt as well as coumadin 3mg daily; INR on day of
discharge 1.9
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- COntinue hep gtt and coumadin until INR therapeutic (2.5 -
3.5).
.
#Volume Status/Acute Renal Failure. Patient with oscillating
renal function in house. Peak   Cr 2.8 from a baseline of ~1.4,
likely secondary to hypovolemia as well as renal hypoperfusion
[**2-27**] anemia.  Urine lytes showed were consistent with
hypovolemia. Initially Bumex was held and she was given IV
hydration. Creatinine increased from 1.8-2.7 in the setting of
diuresis (as above) and bumex was held. During hospital stay
patient was intermittently diuresised and prior to discharge
restarted on PO Bumex 5mg daily with creatinine of 1.7. Weight
at time of discharge: 62.4kg ; sating >95% on 5L NC.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Pleae continue Bumex 5mg PO daily; monitor weights daily as
well as renal function; may consider increasing bumex to [**Hospital1 **] or
transitioning to IV if weight increases >3lb
.
# Esophageal Varices. Newly diagnosed. Patient placed on nadolol
10mg daily.
.
# Hypertension. Patient largely hypotensive to normotensive in
house. Decision made to hold home amlodipine 5mg daily as well
as spironolactone 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Close hemodynamic monitoring; plan to re-initiate
anti-hypertensives if needed.
.
# Pulmonary fibrosis. Patient with transtracheal O2 catheter as
well as use of chronic steriods as an outpatient. During 1st
intubation transtracheal cath was removed. In house patient
received stress dose steriods which were weanted to home
prednisone 10mg daily at time of discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Continue chronic prednisone; consider need for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
[**Name9 (PRE) **] Continue discussion re replacement of transtracheal cath
.
# Hypernatremia. Patient noted to be intermittently
hypernatremic when NPO/intubated. Received free water boluses
thru NGT as well as IV D5 with improvement. Na at time of
discharge 152
OUTPATIENT
-- Continue monitoring of electrolytes; encourage PO intake and
adminster D5W if needed (however by cautious in setting of known
diastolic CHF).

# Goals of Care: On [**2137-10-25**] a goals of care discussion was held
with the patient's HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15155**]. The decision was made to
forgo aggressive management of the colonic adenoma as her life
expectancy with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (which she has
suffered with for ~8 years) is now less than 5 years and likely
less than one. The family wanted the patient to remain full code
and to have aggressive management of her pulmonary disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname **] it was a pleasure taking care of you.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of GI bleed and while
in house you developed respiratory compromise requiring
intubation.
.
Regarding the GI bleed, you were seen by our team of GI doctors
who performed a colonscopy. During the procedure a colonic
lesion was seen and a plan was devised to proceed for excisional
biopsy. You were transfused RBCs as needed and your blood counts
were monitored closely. After discussion with your family the
decision to undergo biopsy was deferred to the outpatient
setting.
.
While in house your breathing became labored on several
occassions which required intubation twice. The cause of the
distress included aspiration and possible pneumonia. You were
started on antibiotics with a plan to complete an 8d course.
Your transtracheal catheter was removed with plan to discuss
replacement as an outpatient. At time of discharge you were
oxygenating well using supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal
cannula.

Also you were noted to have an infection in your GI tract and
were started on antiobiotics to eradicate this bacteria.

Prior to discharge you were feeling much improved and the
decision was made to transition to a nursing facility/rehab
where you can work to optimize strength, mobility and nutrition.
.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS:
START 10mg Nadolol daily for gastric varices
CONTINUE MEROPENEM until [**2137-11-3**]
CONTINUE VANCOMYCIN AND FLAGYL until [**2137-11-9**]
STOP SPIRONOLACTONE and AMLODIPINE until told otherwise
CHANGE COUMADIN to 3mg daily (goal INR 2.5 to 3.5)
CHANGE BUMEX to 5mg daily (previously 5mg twice a day)

Again it was a pleasure taking care of you. Please contact with

direct admit from OSH for transplant work-up

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis
Placement of tunnel line for hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 54 yo male with alcoholic cirrhosis, h/o esophageal
varices, who has had multiple recent admissions to Southern
[**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center for ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Pt
presented recently to the OSH with encephalopathy, and developed
oliguric ARF, severe hyponatremia, and severe hyperkalemia. He
also had a transaminitis on admission to OSH, which improved
during his hospital stay. He had diarrhea, and was found to be
positive for C.dif (presumably [**1-1**] recent Abx treatment for
SBP), and was placed on flagyl. He was treated with octreotide,
midodrine, and albumin for likely HRS. He was initially treated
with levofloxacin, but this was d/c'd after a negative urine cx.
Pt also reportedly underwent therapetuic paracentesis (12 L
removed) 1 week ago. Pt was evaluated for TIPS procedure,
however this was deferred until pt could be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.
.
Pt currently complains only of feeling ""bloated"". He denies
abdominal pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
SOB.

Pertinent Results:
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2150-6-26**] 2:01 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent portal vein, with waveforms suggestive of stagnant
flow, without specific evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
2. Please see report from previous ultrasound regarding
description of left hepatic mass.
.
[**2150-6-26**] ABD U/S: [**2150-6-26**] 8:06 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. 2.2 cm hypoechoic mass in left hepatic lobe that is
concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma.
2. Ascites marked for paracentesis at right lower quadrant.
3. Splenomegaly.
.
[**2150-6-29**] MRI ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis and evidence of portal hypertension given
portosystemic collaterals, splenomegaly, and large volume
ascites.
2. 1.7 cm lesion within segment VIII with unusual enhancement
characteristics; however, which does contain an 8 mm peripheral
nodule which contains some microscopic fat, early hepatocellular
carcinoma cannot be excluded. A hemangioma would be much less
likely.
3. No portal venous enhancement on the post-contrast images,
these findings are suspicious for portal vein thrombosis.
.
[**2150-7-1**] ABD U/S:
IMPRESSION:
No flow seen within the portal vein. It may represent
thrombosis.
Lesion in right lobe of liver, which may represent
hepatocellular carcinoma and previously identified on ultrasound
and MR.
Ascites. Splenomegaly. Splenic varices.
.
[**2150-7-3**] ABD U/S:
CONCLUSION:
Thrombosis of intrahepatic portal vein. Ascites. Approximately
2.5 cm area of low echogenicity in relation to the right lobe of
liver which may represent a hepatocellular CA. Splenomegaly.
Splenic varices.
.
[**2150-7-16**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis.
2. Large amount of ascites.
3. Portal vein thrombosis extends 1-cm into the superior
mesenteric vein and 1.5-cm into the splenic vein.
4. Large right pleural effusion with atelectasis of the right
lower lobe.
5. Ileus.
.
[**2150-7-17**] Portable abdomen:
ABDOMEN, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW.
The lateral aspects of the abdomen are not included on this
film, nor are the obturator foramina. Residual oral contrast is
present in portions of the colon. There are multiple air-filled
dilated loops of small bowel in a stepladder configuration.
Nonethe less, air is seen throughout much of the colon. No
supine film evidence of free air is identified. No bowel wall
thickening is detected and no intramural emphysema is seen. Note
that many forms of hemorrhage would not be evident
radiographically.
.
There appear to be rib fractures in the left posterior ninth and
tenth ribs and question eleventh rib near the costovertebral
junction. The possibility of metastatic lesions in these areas
cannot be excluded.
.
Residual contrast is noted in the bladder.
.
[**2150-6-27**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology identified,
including no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**2150-7-2**] CHEST CT:
IMPRESSION:
1) 4 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule. 3 month follow up
chest CT is recommended in this patient with possible
hepatocellular carcinoma.
2) Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated mild
compressive atelectasis.
3) Bilateral upper lobe peripheral ground glass opacities are
likely inflammatory in etiology or due to resolving pulmonary
edema.
4) Cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
.
[**2150-7-3**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Stable mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural
effusion.
.
[**2150-7-2**] BONE SCAN:
IMPRESSION: 1) Increased tracer activity in region of right
sternoclavicular joint may be degenerative. If isolated osseous
metastasis is considered, then correlation with CT may be of
value. 2) Ascites. 3) If additional characterization of liver
lesion is desired, then a blood pool study may be useful in
evaluation of a possible hemangioma.
.
[**2150-7-8**] RENAL U/S:
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 10.3 cm, and the
left kidney measures 10.8 cm. There is limited evaluation of the
lower pole of the right kidney. There are no renal masses,
stones, or hydronephrosis. The echogenicity of the kidneys is
normal. Ascites is noted in the right upper and lower quadrants.
The bladder is partially collapsed.
There is a small nodular liver consistent with known cirrhosis.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Ascites.
.
[**2150-7-8**] RENAL U/S:
Conclusions:
Suboptimal study.
.
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. The LV is not well seen but
limited views demonstrate normal regional left ventricular wall
motion.. Overall left ventricular systolic function appears

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo M w/ETOH cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus, DM, ARF p/w
ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and w/u for liver transplant
.
# CIRRHOSIS: Patient's cirrhosis most likely secondary to
alcohol and patient was admitted with multiple complications.
Ultrasound at OSH demonstrated possible portal vein thrombosis,
although this finding was not present on 1st doppler study at
[**Hospital1 18**]. Patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis many times
during this admission. He was always negative for SBP. He was
continued on cipro for SBP prophylaxis. Pt's initial U/S was
unremarkable for portal vein thrombus, subsequent Abd U/S with
doppler as well as CT and MRI, notable for Portal vein thrombus.
Anticoagulation was contraindicated given his thrombocytopenia,
pt also developed some oozing around temporary central lines.
His clot then extended into SVC and was no longer a candidate
for transplant surgery. Further transplant work up stopped and
pt was made DNR/DNI given no further options for treatment.
.
# RENAL FAILURE: Patient was admitted with oliguric renal
failure. Patient's renal function decreased rapidly during this
episode of hepatic decompensation,  suggesting hepatorenal
syndrome although likely compounded by intravascular depletion
and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Patient was started on
octreotide, midodrine, and albumin at the OSH. Patient's SBP
dropped during HD from base line BP of 90's to low 80's. He was
then transferred to the ICU for CVVH. He tolerated several
sessions of HD. Plan for continued HD as outpatient as pt would
like to continue HD. Plan was to provide HD as outpatient close
to home. The patient was admitted to the MICU for ongoing CVVHD
given his pressures were prohibitive for traditional HD. The
patient was maintained on midodrine and octreotide for possible
hepatorenal syndrome and was additionally treated with IV
albumin, which was discontinued on [**2150-7-11**]. Midodrine was
increased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. The patient's pressures tolerated CVVHD
well and his creatinine decreased from 5.9 to 2.5. He has
required dialysis, though, since being transferred from the MICU
to the floor, and his renal function has not improved.
Unfortunately, given his coagulopathy, he has had issues with
bleeding from the dialysis catheter site following dialysis. He
did not bleed following his last course of hemodialysis and was
deemed safe to go home.
.
# COAGULOPATHY: Pt developed some oozing around line sites. Labs
showed picture consistent with DIC but this could also be from
underlying liver disease. He received FFP/Cryo before
procedures. He recieved several units of PRBC for low HCT but
remained stable. Had some bleeding from tunneled line. Was given
conjugated estrogen and Vitamin K x 3 doses.
.
# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: During this admission, patient had
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, suggesting likely hepatic
encephalopathy. Patient's mental status much improved with
lactulose therapy. The patient was maintained on lactulose for
encephalopathy. He was noted to have some fluctuation in mental
status but was generally appropriate and oriented.
.
# LIVER MASS: Patient also noted to have hepatic mass on
abdominal ultrasound, suggestive for possible HCC although AFP
only 2.9. Unclear etiology of mass.

known AAA (4.4x4.1cm), AV nodal disease s/p pacer placement, PVD
and AS with valve area 0.81 who presents after diagnostic right
and left heart cath with a hypotensive episode.
.
The patient presented today from home for diagnostic right and
left heart cath. Prior to the procedure, the patient was noted
to be hypertensive to 145/110. She received 5mg IV lopressor.
During the procedure, the patient was noted to be hypertensive
to >200/100. She received heparin 1000U, nitroglycerin gtt at
40mcg/min and then 80mcg/min during the procedure with some bp
response to 180/90. In the post-cath holding area after the
procedure, the patient was again hypertensive to 224/94. She
received hydralazine 10mg IV. Approximately 3 hours after the
procedure at 1:15PM the patient complained of left leg pain
described as cramping, contralateral to her groin access site on
the right. She also complained of nausea and vomiting. She was
noted at this time to have over 2L urine output in her foley
bag. Her BP was 70/palp from 162/60. She received NS bolus of
1L, zofran 4mg IV, dopamine at 5 and then 12mcg/kg/min with
improvement in her bp to 108/52. She was noted to have no
hematoma or at her right groin site and dopplerable pulses in
the distal extremities bilaterally.
.
On presentation to the ICU, the patient was noted to have a bp
141/74 off of dopamine. She complained of some mild epigastric
discomfort. She denies experiencing this pain in the past
however notes in OMR and verbal report from other physicians
describes frequent complaints of abdominal pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. She endorses DOE after 3
flights of stairs in a recent cardiovascular clinic note though
denies this currently. ROS otherwise negative in detail with the
exception of some calf cramping occurring with activity and
relieved with rest.

Right- and Left- Heart Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA. The LAD had no demonstrable stenosis. LCX was
non-dominant
with no significant obstructive disease. The RCA was dominant
without
critical lesions.
2. Left ventriculography showed preserved ejection fraction of
55% and
normal wall motion with small cavity suggestive of diastolic
dysfunction.
3. Abdominal aortography showed an aneurysm of about 4 cm in
size.
4. Hemodynamic assessment revealed markedly elevated systemic
pressures
of above 200 mm Hg. There was a 30 mm Hg gradient across the
aortic
valve with calculated valve are of 0.8 cm2 which was unchanged
from
prior exam. Left and right sided filling pressures were normal
and
cardiac index was preserved. Administration of intravenous
nitroglycerine did not increase PCWP and decreased systemic
blood pressure to 185 mm Hg with brisk diuresis in the lab.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Severe systemic hypetension.
.
.
ECG ([**2180-2-24**]): Atrial pacing. Left axis deviation. Left
anterior fascicular block.
Non-specific lateral and anterolateral ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the
previous tracing ventricular pacing is no longer present.
.
.
2D-[**Year (4 digits) **] ([**2180-2-17**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-12-16**],
aortic gradients and pulmonary pressures are lower but there is
still significant aortic stenosis
.
P-MIBI ([**2178-2-16**]): No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from
baseline. 1. Normal myocardial perfusion.  2. Normal left
ventricular cavity
size and function. EF 66%.
.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2179-12-21**]): 1.  44 x 41 mm abdominal aortic
aneurysm as described above with extensive atherosclerosis in
the branches of the abdominal aorta as well as ectasia of the
iliac arteries. 2. Bilateral renal cortical thinning and
bilateral renal hypodensities likely represent cysts. 3.
Uterine calcifications likely represent fibroids.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 88-year-old [**Location 7972**] woman with
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, known AAA (4.4x4.1cm), AV
nodal disease s/p pacemaker placement, PVD and AS with valve
area 0.81, who presents after diagnostic right- and left- heart
catheterization with a hypotensive episode in the setting of
multiple antihypertensive agents, 2 liter autodiuresis, and
severe abdominal pain.
.
#. Hypotensive episode - The patient experienced hypotension
post-catheterization, likely from a combination of receiving
multiple anti-hypertensives within a short amount of time
(metoprolol, nitroglycerin, and hydralazine), with a
large-volume auto-diuresis, and likely a component of vasovagal
response in the setting of severe abdominal pain. She received
approx 1.5L of volume resuscitation and her anti-hypertensives
were held. She did well clinically thereafter, with good
response in her blood pressure. Her beta-blocker was resumed at
home dose on [**2180-2-26**], which she tolerated well, and she was
started on a low-dose ACE-inhibitor as well, which she also
tolerated well. Her HCTZ was held and was not restarted. She was
discharged on [**2180-2-26**] with follow-up planned with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in 2 weeks.
.
#. Coronary Artery Disease (ischemia) - The patient had no
significant CAD on her left-heart catheterization, and she had
no signs of active ischemia. She was maintained on her home baby
aspirin for primary prophylaxis.
.
#. Pump - The patient has a preserved EF on her most recent TTE,
with no signs of CHF currenty. She is pre-load dependent given
her valvular disease.
.
#. Rhythm - The patient has a history of high-degree AV nodal
disease s/p recent pacemaker placement. She currently has a
paced rhythm.
.
#. Valves - The patient has known severe AS with valve area 0.8.
She will have outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for further
management of her valvular disease.
.
#. Hypertension - The patient's home anti-hypertensives, HCTZ
and metoprolol, were initially held given her hypotensive
episode above. The metoprolol was re-instituted as the patient's
blood pressures improved, and she was also started on an
ACE-inhibitor prior to discharge. Her HCTZ was discontinued.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on her home
cholestyramine and Lescol.
.
#. Vascular Aneurysms - The patient has known AAA (4.3cm),
ascending thoracic aneurysm (3.5cm), and right proximal
popliteal aneurysm, all of which are followed as an outpatient.
.
#. Peripheral Vascular Disease - The patient has PVD s/p
bilateral lower extremity revascularization. She was continued
on her home baby aspirin.

Imaging:
CT-Neck [**9-3**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Soft tissue attenuation noted within the soft tissues of the
right neck
extending from the level of the hyoid bone inferiorly to the
superior
mediastinum as described above. Nonvisualization of the inferior
right
internal jugular vein, which reconstitutes at the level just
superior to the
hyoid bone. Adjacent focal area of hypoattenuation may represent
thrombosed
jugular vein vs cystic lymph nodes. Color doppler US is may be
obtained for
further characterization.

2. Tracheal stent noted originating in the subglottic airway,
extending to
the superior mediastinum with secretions noted inferior to the
stent.

3. Right vocal cord paralysis, with or without tumor
involvement. Correlation
with direct visualization is recommended.

4. Linear air-filled structure extending to the right of
midline, originating
from the esophagus, possibly representing an esophageal
diverticulum.

5. Lytic lesions in vertebral bodies C2 and C3, present on prior
PET without
abnormal FDG uptake. While these findings may be attributed to
degenerative
change, a bone scan may be obtained for further
characterization.
.
Neck US [**9-3**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Large mass in the right neck consistent with tumor spread.

2. Occlusion of the right internal jugular vein but apparently
related to
mass effect or invasion rather than thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure/Methemeglobinemia:  The patient was
intubated with sats in the high 90s after methylene blue.  ABGs
showed improving trend.  Methemeglobinemia likely over at point
of transfer to MICU.  Weaned off vent to CPAP and was extubated
in the afternoon on [**9-2**] by the pulmonary team.  Cardiac enzymes
were trended and were stable.  Reglan was held. Toxicology
followed during stay in MICU and methylene blue was redosed.
.
# Thyroid & Esphageal Carcinoma: Intent of care remained
palliative during this admission. Chemoradiation was deemed to
not have made a significant impact on the patient's symptoms,
which continue to be cough, difficulty breathing / talking, and
dysphagia. The decision was made to stop further chemotherapy
and pursue potential surgical avenues for further palliation. A
number of medication changes were also made, including starting
Mirtazapine for appetite stimulation per palliative care, and
Acetylcysteine and Codeine/Guiafenesin to promote productive
coughing.
.
# Transient hypotension: The patient developed transient
hypotension in the setting of propofol boluses, diarrhea.
Hypovolemia also possible given sinus tach.  Blood pressure
normalized with fluid boluses and in the absence of fever or
leukocytosis, sepsis was deemed unlikely and empiric Vanc/Zosyn
was discontinued.
.
# ARF: Recent elevation this month in the setting of new chemo,
possibly prerenal from chemo associated diarrhea. Cr remained
stable at 1.2; the patient was discharge with Cr 1.1.
# Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia normalized from 132 to
139 upon discharge with volume resuscitation.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for issues with your breathing.  A
bronchoscopy was attempted to see if your stent needed
adjustment but it was appropriately positioned.  Due to a rare
side effect of a medication your oxygen level went low and you
had to go to the intensive care unit.  You were then extubated
and brought to the floor.

On the floor we adjusted your medications to try and help you
deal with your coughing and secretions.  This slightly improved.
 Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] discussed mechanical or procedural fixes to your
swallowing and breathing issues with interventional pulmonolgy
and surgery and they have one possible solution that requires
further work up.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will help arrange this next week.


Your medications have been changed.  Please take your
medications as prescribed.

and got a 2nd L sided chest tube.  She was discharged on [**9-7**] on
Dilaudid 2 mg PO Q8.
.
Pt. presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**9-7**] c/o diffuse weakness,
episodic numbness, diffuse body pain.  She was given 2 mg IV
Dilaudid in ED, 0.5 mg Ativan, and admitted to medicine for pain
control.  She was started on Amitriptyline however she never
received a dose. In the morning she was found to be complaining
of back pain and pain at the site of her chest tube placement.
She denied constipation, diarrhea or bowel incontinence, dysuria
or incontinence of urine, weakness or numbness, though she did
report ""tingling"" in her abdomen, and that she ""can't feel bowel
movements coming out.""  At 9PM that evening, she was found to be
unresponsive with a poor respiratory effort.  She was moving all
extremities spontaneously.  She was lethargic but appropriate 20
minutes before.  Initially her O2 sats were 70% on RA, HR 100,
SBP 160.  Her O2 sats improved to 94% on a face mask.  She had
clear breath sounds bilaterally.  She was intubated for airway
protection.  Her ABG was found to be 6.86/179/168/35/lactate
2.4.  Of note her WBC count increased to 22.4 with 78%
Neutrophils and 0% bands from 7.8 earlier today. She received
Narcan x1. She was transferred to the MICU.

CT CHEST

INDICATION: History of recurrent pneumothoraces, Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome,
pulmonary embolism with increasing left-sided chest pain.

Comparison is made to the prior chest CT dated [**2132-9-18**]
and prior
chest x-ray on the same day.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed
following
intravenous administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.
Multiplanar
reconstructions were also obtained.

FINDINGS: Compared to the prior CT scan, there has been interval
development
of a large left-sided pneumothorax. This also appears to have
progressed
significantly compared to the chest x-ray performed on the same
day. There
are associated atelectatic changes in the left lung. There is
again evidence
of left upper lobe wedge resection. Multiple peripheral blebs
are noted along
the right upper lobe. Linear atelectatic changes are
demonstrated in the
right lower lobe with marked interval reexpansion of the right
lower lobe.
There has been development of an oval shaped roughly 3.8 x 2.1
cm
low-attenuation lesion in the right lower lobe with a few foci
of gas most
consistent with loculated fluid. The pulmonary arteries
demonstrate no
evidence of pulmonary embolism. The heart, pericardium, and
great vessels are
within normal limits. Note is made of a tracheostomy tube. An NG
tube is
also noted. No pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or
hilar lymph
nodes are demonstrated.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: The above findings were confirmed with
multiplanar
reconstructions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of very large left-sided pneumothorax.
2. Marked interval reexpansion of the right lower lobe compared
to the prior
CT scan with residual small loculated fluid collection in the
right lower
lobe.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Approved: SAT [**2132-9-27**] 9:06 AM
Procedure Date:[**2132-9-26**]

Clinical: Left recurrent pneumothorax.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh and labeled with the
patient's name, medical record number and ""right upper lobe
wedge"" and consists of three wedge resections of lung, the
smallest measuring 2.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm, the second measuring 3.6
x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, and the largest measuring 8.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm.
The pleural surface is smooth and without any gross
abnormalities. Serial sectioning reveals a red-brown spongy cut
surface without any lesions. The specimen is represented in A-C.

TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2132-10-16**] AT 14:51

COMPARISON: Previous study of earlier the same date at 8:24.

INDICATION: Status post removal of left-sided chest tube.

Since the recent chest radiograph, a left-sided chest tube has
been removed.
A small left apical pneumothorax is present, best visualized on
the lateral
view. In retrospect, this is also present on the pre-chest tube
removal
radiograph and is without interval change. On the PA view, the
pneumothorax
was partially obscured by the overlying chest tube on the
previous film,
rendering it more difficult to visualize prospectively. The
remainder of the
chest radiograph is without change since the recent radiograph.

IMPRESSION: Small left apical pneumothorax, stable in retrospect
compared to
pre-chest tube removal radiograph of earlier the same date.

Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2132-10-16**] 5:53 PM
Procedure Date:[**2132-10-16**]

INDICATION: 35-year-old woman with abdominal distention. Please
assess for
bowel obstruction.

COMPARISON: Abdominal radiograph dated [**2132-10-6**].

TECHNIQUE: AP supine and upright abdominal radiographs were
obtained.

FINDINGS: There is an NG tube which on [**2132-10-6**] had
shape
consistent with post pyloric position but now is coiled over the
left abdomen
presumably within the non-distended stomach. Small and large
bowel are of
normal caliber. Air is seen throughout loops of small bowel and
within the
proximal colon. There is no definite free air identified. There
are two 5 cm
metallic linear objects overlying the right abdomen with shape
consistent with
[**Doctor First Name **] pins and are likely external to the patient. There is
stable appearance
of bilateral breast implants. Bony structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction. NG tube with tip
previously in post-
pyloric position has now migrated back into the stomach.

Procedure Date:[**2132-10-10**]


Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo F with h/o spontaneous PTX, GBS, HIT induced PEs,
vent-associated pneumonia called out from the MICU [**10-1**].  Her
recent history is significant for 2 admissions to [**Hospital1 2025**]
([**Date range (1) 32318**]/05) for spontaenous left pneumothoraces.  On her first
admission, she had a left sided chest tube placed, a VATS, and
pleurodesis.  She tolerated this well and was discharged on PO
dilaudid for pain control.  She re-presented for her second
admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] with a recurrent pneumothorax, got a 2nd left
sided chest tube, and was again discharged on PO dilaudid.
After being dischraged from [**Hospital1 2025**] she presented the same day to
[**Hospital1 18**] complaining of diffuse weakness and body pain as well as
episodic numbness.  She was initially treated with pain control
with a morphine PCA per the pain service.  She continued to have
diffuse weakness, increasing anxiety and psychiatry was
initially consulted for ? conversion disorder.  On the evening
of [**9-9**] a code was called as she was unresponsibe with a poor
respiratory effort (HR 100, sBP 160, O2Sat 70% on RA --> 94% on
face mask).  An ABG revealed pH 6.86, pO2 168 pCOs 179).  She
was intubated and transferred to the MICU.

1st MICU course:
A neurology consult felt her elevated LP protein (112), diffuse
motor weakness, rapid time course, and rapid increase in her
peripheral WBC ([**8-8**]) were all consistent with GBS.  She was
started on plasmapheresis and received four sessions (fifth
session was not completed because pheresis line had to be pulled
due to positive HIT antibody).  She also developed ventilator
associated pneumonia for which she was treated with
vanco/levo/vanc for a 7 day course which was finished on [**9-17**].
She also developed heparin associated thrombocytopenia which
improved after d/cing all heparin products.  On [**9-18**], she had
increasing respiratory distress and increasing O2 requirements
and a CTA revealed pulmonary emboli found within all 3 segmental
branches of the RUL pulmonary artery.  Due to her positive HIT
antibody, she was started on argatroban and coumadin.  She was
switched to a trach mask on [**9-23**] and tolerated this and on [**9-25**]
was transferred to the floor.  The morning of [**9-26**] she developed
[**10-27**] stabbing, non-radiating, L sided chest pain.  Cardiac
enzymes were negative and a stat ECHO showed no WMA.  A CXR was
unremarkable but a CT scan showed a large L PTX and she was
transferred back to the MICU.

2nd MICU course:
Her INR was reversed and on [**9-30**] she had a mechanical
pleurodesis and LUL wedge resection.  No blebs were seen but
there was abnormal appearing lung tissue in the apex.  She was
transferred out of the MICU on [**10-1**].

1. Pneumothorax: unclear etiology of recurrent PTX.  Possibly
secondary to her stature.  alpha-1-antitrypsin was negative.
S/p L-sided wedge resection and pleurodesis on [**9-30**].  She had 2
chest tubes and one was removed [**10-6**], but [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain was left
in place.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was removed on [**10-17**] after a
successful flamping trial.  She will follow up with CT surgery
in 1 week.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: She had a PE in all 3 branches of RUL
pulmonary artery on [**9-18**] CT scan.  Developed HIT with
plasmapheresis for GBS.  Restarted argatroban and coumadin [**10-1**]
following CT surgery.  She was initially on coumadin 2.5 mg PO
QHS and stable with an INR between [**2-21**].  Her INR started to
trend down, however, and her coumadin was adjusted to 3 mg PO
QHS.  Before discharge however, her INR started to trend up
slightly past 3, so she was discharged on 2.5 mg PO QHS.  Her
INR will be followed up by her PCP during her appointment later
this week.  He has been called regarding this.

3. Guillain-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome: She was s/p four cycles of
plasmapheresis (didn't get fifth cycle due to developing HIT).
Her tracheostomy was dwonsized on [**10-10**].  Trach was buttoned on
[**10-13**] and removed on [**10-14**].  On discharge, her stoma was almost
completely healed and well-granulated.  She will continue to
bandage it until completely healed (7-10 days from removal
date), and will cover it with cellophane for showering.  Her
strength returned over the course of her admission with daily
physical therapy.  On discharge, she was able to walk on her own
with a cane and to manage a couple flight of stairs.  She has a
follow-up appointment scheduled with neurology, and has the
phone number of interventional pulmonary should she have any
questions regarding her stoma.

4. Pain: Patient has pain secondary to her Guillain-[**Location (un) **] and
Pneumothorax.  Her PCA was discontinued once the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was
removed, and her pain was well controlled with a fentanyl patch
and oral morphine, which will be tapered as an outpatient.  She
will also continue neurontin 600 mg TID per neurology.  She was
not given oxycodone as she had a history of anaphylaxis to
percocet.

5. Anxiety: She has chronic anxiety which has been heightened by
recent course of events.  She was placed on her home dose of
standing ativan 0.5 mg PO Q6, and had several discussions with
social work and psychiatry nurses in-house.

6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia - L retrocardiac opacity that
has since rsesolved.  Sputhm from [**9-11**] with Haemophilus
B-lactamase negative.  She completed a 7 day course of Levo/Vanc
on [**9-17**].  She was afebrile with a normal WBC count on discharge.

7. Anemia - Her hematocrit was stable since her 2nd transfer out
of the MICU and her anemia was thought to be secondary to
frequent blood draws.  No evidence of an RP bleed by CT scan, no
evidence of hemolysis.  She was transfused with 2 units on [**10-8**].
 Her hematocrit had been stable for several days on discharge.

8. Abdominal pain - She developed intermittent abdominal pain
after her second transfer out of the MICU which required
placement of an NG tube with tube feeding.  Her abdominal pain
spontaneously improved to the point where the tube was removed
and she was tolerating a regular diet, and further improved once
she was told to take POs slowly and to avoid milk products.  She
was discharged tolerating a regular diet with no further
abdominal complaints.

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: The pt is a 78 yo M with a h/o CAD,
HTN, HL, DM who presents from his PCP's office after routine CBC
showed 66% atypical white blood cells and low platelets on a
routine CBC. He initially sought care from his PCP after he had
noticed that he had noticed increased bleeding from the site of
a removed childhood skin tumor which had been severely pruritic,
causing him to scratch it with a sharp back-scratcher
repeatedly. The PCP felt the patient had an infected cyst and
started abx. His PCP drew [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CBC which showed 66% atypical white
cells and thrombocytopenia with a normal white cell count and
hematocrit. He then ordered immunophenotyping which is pending,
and sent the patient to the ED. On review of systems, the
patient also notes more malaise and dyspnea on exertion over the
last month, as well as intermittently blood streaked stools and
melena.

In the ED, the patient was noted to have no evidence of bleeding
but labs concerning for DIC and tumor lysis. He was seen by the
heme-onc consult fellow. He was given 2 amps of bicarb with D5W
at 100 cc/hr. He was given 10u of cryoprecpitate and transfused
platelets. He also received 50 mg PO of all-trans retinoic acid.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo male with distant history of stable angina, new diagnosis
of acute promyelocytic leukemia, transferred to the ICU with
tachycardia after ATRA treatment on the hematology malignancy
floor, with DIC, pulmonary edema, and delirium.
.
# APML: He was diagnosed with APML with 56% blasts on
differential [**2174-3-18**]. He was treated with ATRA and subsequently
suffered from ATRA syndrome with an acute elevation in his WBC
to >50 K. He had significant pulmonary leak. He was treated with
ATRA throughout and received Idarubicin which had to be stopped
secondary to elevated bilirubin. His blasts and WBC subsequently
decreased, and on smear [**2174-4-4**] his myelocytes showed
differentiation with improving status of his leukemia. ATRA was
continued throughout his hospitalization. As a consequence of
treatment, his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome
with his uric acid peaking above 10, with a change an increase
in creatinine to 2.5 initially and subsequently higher as
described below. He was treated with allopurinol initially, and
required a 1x dose of Rasburicase which led to the resolution of
his TLS. He was maintained on his allopurinol for continued
treatment.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial in the setting of
pulmonary leak from ATRA and likely alveolar hemorrhage. His
fluid balance reached a peak of 27L positive secondary to his
blood product requirement. He initially required a PEEP of 22
with FiO2 of 100%. Over the course of 10 days he was able to be
weaned down with the assistance of CVVH for fluid overload to
pressure support of [**5-19**]. His mental status was the largest
obstacle to extubation and he was taken for tracheotomy tube
placement by Thoracic Surgery on [**2174-4-8**]. He tolerated the
procedure well, and was able to be transitioned to trach collar
starting on [**2174-4-10**] for periods of time.
.
# DIC: Due to his APML, he developed DIC evidenced by active
bleeding from his ET tube, his OG tube, his stool and urine. He
had acute drops in fibrinogen, increase in LDH and increase in
bilirubin. He was supported through this with massive
transfustions requiring 18 units of PRBCs, 35 units of
platelets, 5 units of FFP, and 24 units of cryoprecipitate. He
was intubated due hypoxia and increased work of breathing on
[**2174-3-26**]. His CXR after intubation showed a fluffy infiltrate
suggestive of either ARDS or hemorrhage (likely both). Due to
his subdural hematomas, he was transfused to goals of Hct>30,
plts > 100, fibrinogen > 175, and INR <1.6. Once the DIC
resolved, his goals changed to Hct>25, plts > 20, fibrinogen >
100, and INR <1.6.
.
# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: He started experiencing a
decline in mental status 2 days prior to intubation with severe
asterixis and confusion. He had a number of potential causes
such as medications, central focus with his SDH, and
hypertension to 180 making PRES a less likely, but possible
concern. Also, his uremia given his acute renal failure. He
required several doses of Haldol and intermittent restraints for
safety prior to intubation, when he was put on midazolam and
Fentanyl drips. 5 days after intubation his was sedation was
discontinued and he remained obtunded. He was treated with
dialysis for a uremia over 200. His mental status was the
barrier to extubation as his vent setting were minimal at the
point of weaning sedation. He was non responsive after 4 days
off of sedation. A family meeting was held with his husband
[**Name (NI) **], and the decision was made to take him to trach, with the
goal of trying to improve his mental status with dialysis.

# Acute renal failure: His creatinine sharply rose from 1.2 on
admission to a peak of 4.9. This was thought to be in the
setting of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) and abdominal compartment
syndrome. Also complicated by ATN in the setting of low blood
volume and possible microthrombi during DIC. He was treated
allopurinol and Rasburicase for TLS with good resolution as well
as with CVVH initially (1 day) for fluid removal. His urine
output responded. Shortly after he began autodiuresing He was
initiated on dialysis for AMS as described above and a BUN of
greater than 200. He was treated with dialysis with a fall in
BUN to 113, however, he had a fever to 100.6 and cultures came
back positive for GPC in chains from dialysis catheter [**2174-4-9**].
.
# Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: In the setting of acute volume
overload from large volume transfusions given DIC as above. He
was ~25L positive for LOS fluid balance. He developed elevated
bladder pressures and decreased urine output. Surgery was
consulted and felt that as long as he was making urine there was
no need for surgical intervention (as well as given his critical
illness, it was not indicated). He was started on CVVH as above
and had 3L removed. His kidneys responded and began making
100-200cc/hr of urine. His CVVH was stopped and he was allowed
to diurese on his own with support of lasix and metolazone as
needed.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation / Flutter: He developed tachycardia to the
140s with initial EKG most consistent with Afib, and later EKG
more consistent with Aflutter vs AVNRT.  His HR did not respond
to Diltiazem drip or multiple subsequent IV boluses of Diltiazem
and Metoprolol.  Cardiology suggested Verapamil, followed by
Amiodarone.  He was loaded with Amiodarone drip and bolus of 150
mg x2.  He was cardioverted on [**2174-3-22**] and continued on
Amiodarone.  He got an extra 150mg of amiodarone on [**3-25**] with
minimal effect on tachycardia. He converted to NSR, and reverted
back to atrial fibrillation. In the setting of controlling his
blood pressure with IV medications he received multiple doses of
metoprolol and labetalol, and he converted to NSR. However, [**4-1**]
he converted back to rapid a-fib with RVR and required
uptitration of his B-blockade and a diltiazem drip which was
eventually converted back to PO.
.
# Bilateral Subdural Hematomas: Unclear time course.
Neurosurgery followed along and he had serial scans. His
hematomas had interval increased in the setting of the DIC;
however, not thought to be clinically significant. Neurosurgery
preferred medical management with antiepileptics and reversal of
his coagulopathy.
.
# Right basal ganglia infarct: On repeat scan of his head to
evaluate interval change of his subdural hematomas on [**2174-4-4**], a
new right sided basal ganglia infarct was noted. Neurosurgery
followed, and neurology was consulted. They felt that medical
management and blood pressure control were the best means of
treatment.
.
# Positive Blood Cultures: Blood cultures were positive in [**2-16**]
bottles from his PICC line on [**2174-3-22**].  The aerobic culture was
speciated as Staph aureus.  No peripheral culture was obtained
on that date.  He was started on Vancomycin / Meropenem on
[**2174-3-22**] after spiking a fever to 102.5.  This was changed to
Vancomycin / Cefepime the next day.  Given the concern for
translocation of gut bacteria with his compromised immune
system, he was switched to Vancomycin / Zosyn on [**2174-3-24**] for
better coverage of gut pathogens.  Micafungin was added to cover
for fungal pathogens. He had multiple sets of negative
surveillance cultures, and his antibiotics were continued while
he remained neutropenic. He had a fever to 100.6 on [**2174-4-9**] and
cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter which were
positive for GPCs in chains. His catheter was pulled and he was
continued on vancomycin.
.
# Pericardial Fat Pad: On echo on [**2174-3-24**] there was concern for
pericardial effusion because the echo showed a new anterior
pericardial effusion with complex echodensity.  No evidence of
tamponade physiology was seen on the echo.  His repeat echo
showed that the effusion was actually a fat pad.
.
# Alcoholism/Cirrhosis: He was known to drink a bottle of
alcohol per night. He initially required 10 mg IV diazepam
several times and started on a CIWA scale.  On RUQ imaging for
persistent elevation of his bilirubin, cirrhosis was noted. More
than likely his cirrhosis was secondary to alcoholism and he had
poor clearance of his bilirubin (from reabsorption from pooled
blood).
.
# Elevated Glucose: He initially had glucose's in the 400??????s in
the setting of getting steroids. His insulin coverage was
briefly switched to an insulin drip, and he was subsequently
converted to subcutaneous insulin based on his requirements.

# Goals of care: Pt remained in coma. His overall clinical
status continued to decline over the course of hospitalization,
with evolution of multi-system organ failure including increased
pulmonary ventilatory requirements, persistant renal failure,
LFTs continued to increase and he developed recurrent bacteremia
(initially MSSA, then VRE). He was given 1 dose of daptomycin
for VRE coverage. Given his multiple organ failure, worsening
ventilatory requirements and persistent altered mental status, a
family meeting was held and decision made to focus efforts on
patient comfort beginning [**2174-4-12**] AM. The patient quietly
expired on [**2174-4-14**] with family at the bedside.

History of Present Illness:
38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed
hypertension presented with 5 days of headache, found to have
SBP in 200-210, admitted to MICU on nitroprusside drip.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 86556**] initially presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2151-3-8**] with a
new, dull, constant headache, was found to have BP 200/120, Cr.
1.5, aldosterone 61, renin 1.9. Serum metaneprhine fraction was
normal; 24-hr urine metanephrine pending. He was started on
lisinopril 20 mg qday. Three days later, BP was still high, and
his lisinopril was increased to 40 mg qday and labetolol 100 [**Hospital1 **]
was added. Outpatient nephrologist suggested renal MRI for
further work-up of his elevated creatinine. He went back to the
PCP's office the day of admission when his BP was found to be
unchanged; labetolol was added. With persistent headache, he
presented to the ED. He denies any visual changes, chest pain,
shortness of breath, weakness.
.
In ED, initial BP was 200-210/110-120, HR in the 50s. Exam,
including optic disc exam, was unremarkable. Cr. was 1.8. He was
started on nitroprusside at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and his SBP dropped
quickly to 160. Nitroprusside was decreased to 0.15 mcg/kg/min.
By transfer to MICU, his BP was 180/100, HR 70s. He received one
Percocet for his headache.

Brief Hospital Course:
38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed
hypertension presented with 5 days of headache, found to have
SBP in 200-210, admitted to MICU on nitroprusside drip.
.
# HTN: His SBP was in the 170s on arrival to the MICU. The
nitroprusside was discontinued after 2 hours, after the
initiation of labetolol 200 mg PO bid. His SBP remained in
140s-160s overnight then increased to 180s-190s. Labetolol was
uptitrated to 200 mg PO tid. His headache decreased but still
persisted. No visual changes, chest pain, shortness of breath.
Blood pressure rose back to 200.  Nitroglycerin drip was
started.  Labetalol was uptitrated; HCTZ was added.  Hydralazine
was given for short-acting effect.  The next morning the
nitroglycerin was titrated off and the patient did well.  He was
transferred to the floor on labetalol 600mg [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine 10mg
daily and HCTZ 25mg daily.  He did well with SBPs to in the 140
to 160 range.  His headaches improved.  He was discharged with
close follow-up to repeat BP checks.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr. 1.8, from 1.5 at PCP's office on
Monday. Recent increase might be due to initiation of ACE
inhibitor, so his lisinopril was held. Renal ultrasound should
normal appearing kidneys, but was concerning for possible RAS or
fibromuscular dysplasia. FENa was 1.1%. Nephrology was consulted
and saw rare muddy-brown casts concerning for ATN. Concerning
for FSGS as well.  HIV was negative.  His Cr initially
stabilized, then rose slightly to 2.3 on the day of discharge.
However, he was making good amounts of urine and had no
electrolyte disturbances.  He was discharged with instructions
to follow-up closely with his PCP with repeat lab tests.  He
will also see a nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86557**].  He should a kidney
MRA as an outpatient once his creatinine clearance has improved.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52 year old gentleman
with end-stage renal disease secondary to poly-cystic kidney
disease.  He has been on Hemodialysis for the past five years
via a left AV graft.  He presents now for a cadaveric renal
transplant.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Zestril 5 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Celexa 20 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Rocaltrol one tablet p.o. q. day.
6.  Renagel 3200 mg p.o. three times a day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Transplant Surgery Service on [**2130-2-20**], and underwent
an uncomplicated cadaveric renal transplant. The patient
tolerated the procedure well and had a postoperative course
that was significant for delayed graft function.  His
hospital course is summarized as follows by systems:
1.  Neurologic:  The patient had adequate pain control on a
morphine PCA postoperatively.  When the patient was
tolerating p.o. intake on postoperative day three, the
patient's PCA was discontinued and he was started on Percocet
for pain control with good effect.

2.  Respiratory:  The patient was requiring an oxygen
supplementation for the initial five days postoperatively
with oxygen saturations ranging from 93 to 95% on two liters.
Once the patient began ambulating and using his incentive
spirometer, he no longer needed supplemental oxygen,
saturating 95% on room air.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Immediately postoperatively, the
patient's Atenolol was held.  Back on postoperative day one,
the patient was noted to have a decrease in his systolic
blood pressure to around 90, coincident with a decrease in
his urine output.  The patient was given fluid boluses but
his pressure continued to decline, reaching a nadir of 74
systolic.  The decision was made to transfer the patient to
the SICU for closer monitoring of his volume status using his
CBP.  Once in the Unit, the patient's systolic pressure
increased to the low 100's.  He was started on a renal dose
Dopamine drip.  It was believed that his episode of
hypotension coincident with some shaking chills, was
secondary to a gamma globulin reaction.  His gamma globulin
was subsequently discontinued and he remained in the SICU
until postoperative day four.

At that time, the patient's systolic pressures were back up
into the 140s to 150s and he was making good urine.  He was
subsequently discharged to the Floor where his pressures
remained in the normal range throughout the remainder of his
hospital stay.  He had no complaints of chest pain or
shortness of breath throughout the hospital stay.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was tolerating a limited
p.o. intake by postoperative day two, but continued to
increase his p.o. intake to the point of tolerating a regular
renal diet by the day of discharge.  He was on a bowel
regimen of Colace and Dulcolax suppositories p.r.n.  He had a
bowel movement on postoperative day three.

5.  Genitourinary:  The patient's creatinine preoperatively
was 12.7, and in the PACU had dropped to 11.5 with a
potassium of 5.5.  However, coincident with his episode of
hypotension on the morning of postoperative day one, his
potassium had risen to 7.2 and his creatinine had jumped up
to 12.6.  Once in the SICU, the Renal Team decided to dialyze
the patient.  He underwent one treatment of hemodialysis.
His creatinine dropped to 8.7 with a potassium of 5.6.  Over
the next couple of days, his creatinine rose to level off at
a level of approximately 10.0.  There it remained for the
remainder of his hospital stay.  While he was in the
Intensive Care Unit he was receiving 80 mg of intravenous
Lasix twice daily to maintain his urine output.

After transferring to the Floor and maintaining an output of
approximately 250 cc an hour, his intravenous fluids were
discontinued on postoperative day five.  On postoperative day
six, his intravenous Lasix was discontinued and the patient
continued to have an adequate urine output.  At the time of
discharge, he still remained approximately 12 liters positive
from his preoperative dry weight.  It was noted that the
patient had some unilateral swelling of his right arm
concerning for a thrombosis secondary to the right IJ central
venous line.  On the [**2-24**], a right upper extremity
ultrasound was performed that demonstrated widely patent
venous outflow with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.

It was felt that the unilateral swelling was secondary to the
patient's positive fluid status combined with poor venous
outflow secondary to his right AV fistula.

6.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had no infectious
complications throughout the course of his hospital stay.

7.  Immunosuppression:  The patient was initially started on
Thymoglobulin, CellCept, Solu-Medrol, postoperatively.  After
it was believed that the patient was having a reaction to
Thymoglobulin, he received a dose of 100 mg of Zenapax on
[**2-22**].  The Thymoglobulin was discontinued and he was
loaded on Rapamune.  The patient received a second dose of
Zenapax four days after the first dose.  Rapamune levels were
sent after the third dose and are pending at the time of this
dictation.  The patient's white count has levelled off at
around 5 to 6,000.

8.  Tubes, Lines and Drains:  The patient had a right
internal jugular line which was discontinued on postoperative
day five.  The patient's Foley catheter was removed on
postoperative day five and had absolutely no trouble voiding.
His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain continued to put out greater than 30
cc over a 24 hour period, and therefore, the patient will be
discharged home with the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] in place.

DISPOSITION:   The patient is expected to be discharged on
[**2130-2-27**].

markedly hyperintense on FLAIR and long TR spin echo images.
There is a prominent cystic component anteriorly, extending into
the right frontal lobe. This measures approximately 4 x 5 x 6
cm. The mass enhances inhomogeneously after contrast
administration. The sella turcica is markedly enlarged. The mass
extends into the prepontine cistern and grossly fills the left
cavernous sinus. The left internal carotid artery is encased in
its cavernous and supraclinoid portions as it courses through
the mass.  The optic chiasm is traumatically elevated by the
lesion, and I cannot identify the course of the optic nerves as
they pass over this lesion to approach the optic canals. This
lesion appears most likely to represent a pituitary adenoma.

The mass elevates the third ventricle and causes compression at
the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]. This apparently is
responsible for bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles,
more severe on the right than left.

CONCLUSION: Massive sellar and suprasellar enhancing neoplasm,
most likely a pituitary adenoma. There is compression of the
optic chiasm and hydrocephalus due to elevation and compression
of the ventricular system at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].

[**2149-5-11**] CTA Head: Large sellar and suprasellar mass with
components in the pontine cistern, cavernous sinus, suprasellar
cistern, and invaginating into the right  frontal lobe. The
appearance remains consistent with a pituitary adenoma.  There
is encasement of the left internal carotid artery and the
anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally course through the
lesion.

[**5-14**] CT Head:
No significant change in large suprasellar mass leading to right
lateral ventricular dilation. There is no evidence of interval
hemorrhage.


[**5-14**] CT Head postop:
In comparison to a study obtained five hours prior, there is
notable
improvement in right lateral ventricular dilatation and right
frontal cystic lesion. There is no hemorrhage along the course
of the right ventriculostomy catheter, which is terminating in
the third ventricle. Small-to-moderate pneumocephalus is likely
post-surgical.

[**5-15**] CT Head: In comparison to [**2149-5-14**] exam, there is mild
improvement in ventricular size. No evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage. Small-to-moderate pneumocephalus
persists, likely post-surgical.

[**5-17**] CT Head -
1. Stable size of the ventricles compared to [**2149-5-15**], with mild
dilatation of the right lateral ventricle.
2. The large sellar/suprasellar mass, with a large cystic
component indenting the right frontal lobe

[**5-23**] Ct head - s/p r VP shunt, no acute hemorrhage


Brief Hospital Course:
26M who was admitted to Neurosurgery for a right frontal cystic
lesion and a sellar/suprasellar mass with subsequent
hydrocephalus. He admitted to the ICU for close observation
given his imaging. A MRI was obtained on [**5-10**] to better evaluate
the lesions.

On [**5-11**] a CTA head was obtained for surgical planning. Endocrine
was also consulted given the sellar/suprasellar mass. Per
Endocrine request, labs were ordered and a cortisol stimulation
test was done on [**5-12**] AM. Hydrocortisone was held in order to
perform cortisol stim test.a 1 gram Dilantin bolus was given for
a serum dilantin level of 0.8. Overnight the patient became very
aggitated, pulling out his IV line requiring ativan.  The
patient got out of bed and wanted to leave the hospital ""Against
Medical Advice""

On [**5-12**], patient was seen to have bitemporal hemianopsia, but
was otherwise intact on examination. The Cortisol Stim teast was
performed and the cortisol levels at 30 minites, 60 minites and
90 minites were.2-30 mins,21-60 mins,22- 90 mins.  Neuro-optho
was consulted for formal visual field testing which was done on
[**2149-5-13**] which demonstrated stable bitemporal hemianopsia.
Endocrine recommended stopping the hydrocortisone and decreasing
the decadron. Neuro and rad oncology were also consulted.

On [**2149-5-14**], Patient underwent am aspiration of the right frontal
cyst and EVD placement.  He tolerated the procedure well without
intraoperative complications.  Please review dictated operative
report for details. He was extubated and transferred to the ICU.
Post operative Head CT revealed no hemorrhage and significant
decompression.  He was bolused with 500mg of Dilantin for a
subtherapeuric level of 7.2 and his dose was increased to 200mg
[**Hospital1 **].

On [**5-15**] the EVD was clamped after CT head demonstrated stable
ventricular size however it had to be opened approximately
2.5hrs after clamping for severe headache and episode of
confusion.  It was opened at 10cm above the tragus.  Per
Endocrinology the patient was given cabergoline 0.5mg as a
one-time dose and the patient was switched from dexamethasone to
prednisone 7.5mg daily according to their recommendations.  He
was given a Dilantin bolus of 500mg for a Dilantin level of 9.6.


On [**5-16**] the patient's mental status was stable and so an EVD
wean was started.  The patient tolerated elevation of the drain
to 20cm above the tragus.  Dilantin level was therapeutic at
12.9.  Pt was transfered to the stepdown unit.  His ventricular
drain was clamped several times but patient continued to have
elevated ICPs and severe headaches.  Plan for VP shunt was
postponed on [**5-20**] for fever to 102.7.  Fever workup was negative
for DVT with lower extremity Dopplers, negative consolidation on
chest xray.  Blood, urine and CSF cultures were sent on [**5-20**].
He devoloped a total body rash that resembled a reaction to
dilantin and so the patient was transitioned to Keppra, Dilantin
was stopped and the rash was treated topically with
hydrocortisone cream and with Oral benadryl PRN.  No respiratory
distress, no oral swelling. He was afebrile on [**5-21**] and was
neurolopgically stable with EVD in place while awaiting VP shunt
placement.

On [**2149-5-23**], patient had a right VP shunt place by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. On
the day of surgery he had stress dose steroids with
Hydrocortisone 50mg Q8 and then resumed prednisone 7.5mg daily.

Now DOD, pt is afebrile, vital signs are stable, and tolerating
a good oral diet.  His pain is well controlled and incision
appear clean/dry/intact.  He is set for d/c home in stable
condition.

(Final
      [**2188-12-15**]):
      POSITIVE FOR PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECII (CARINII).
.
CXR (Portable AP) [**2188-12-12**]:
FINDINGS: AP portable upright view of the chest is obtained.
Diffuse parenchymal opacities are noted which are more notable
in the lower lungs.  The overall appearance is suggestive of
pulmonary edema though the possibility of pneumonia cannot be
entirely excluded. Given the relative sparing of the upper
lungs, the possibility of underlying emphysema is considered. No
large pleural effusions or definite sign of pneumothorax is
seen. A rounded structure projects over the right mid lung which
is likely external to the patient. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is normal. Bones appear intact.

IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema, though
cannot exclude
pneumonia.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2188-12-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute CT findings in the abdomen or pelvis.
2. Ground-glass opacities in both lungs may represent pulmonary
edema,
inflammatory and/or infectious disease.
3. Fatty infiltration of the submucosa of the ascending [**Month/Day/Year 499**],
cecum, and
terminal ileum compatible with history of Crohn's disease. No
evidence of
acute Crohn's flare.
.
TTE [**2188-12-13**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with probable mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
inferior septum. Due to suboptimal technical quality, other
focal wall motion abnormalities cannot be fully excluded. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: poor technical quality. The basal to mid inferior
septum is probably hypokinetic, other focal wall motion
abnormalityies cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is
not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
.
CT Chest [**2188-12-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No findings of interstitial lung disease. Progressive diffuse
ground
glass pulmonary opacities in conjunction with more solid
peribronchiolar
consolidation within the lower lobes. The findings are most
suggestive of
infection with the differential including PJP, viral (CMV), and
bacterial.  Other possibility includes diffuse alveolar
damage/ARDS.
2. Interval development of peripancreatic fluid tracking into
the left
pararenal space suggestive of acute pancreatitis.
3. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
.
RUQ ultrasound [**2188-12-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
2. No peripancreatic fluid collection.
3. Echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be
excluded on the basis of imaging.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course
62M Crohn's dz presented with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea and
lower extremity edema as well as diarrhea and weight loss.
.
# Dyspnea/PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] presented with dyspnea with mild cough,
orthopnea and lower extremity edema and had oxygen saturations
in the low 90s on a 60% venturi mask. Chest imaging did not show
any focal process but was concerning for either fluid overload
or an inflammatory process. A BNP was ~200. He was initially
diuresed for suspected CHF exacerbation and started on
levo/flagyl (later ceftriaxone, azithromycin, flagyl) for
possible pneumonia. He failed to improve on diuretics and
antibiotics. An echo showed no evidence of significant systolic
dysfunction (EF 50%). On the second day of hospitalization
sputem cultures showed PCP and he was started on IV bactrim and
IV steroids. His oxygen requirement significantly improved over
the next two days and he had oxygen saturations ~95% on 3L NC at
the time of transfer to the floor. On medicine floor, pt
continued to improved; O2 sat requirement decreased and was able
to take POs. Pt discharged to rehab to complete course of abx
(PO bactrim DS 3 tabs TID, 21 days [**Date range (1) 88033**] per ID) and
recovery.
.
# HIV/AIDS: Diagnosed this admission with HIV viral load of
489,000, CD4 of 10 and OI as above. ID consult was obtained for
management of PCP in [**Name Initial (PRE) **] newly diagnosed HIV patient and it was
agreed to continue with IV bactrim and steroids (3wk course,
switched to PO prednisone on [**2188-12-21**] at 40mg x5days the 20mg
prednisone x11days). HAART therapy was not initiated at this
time in the setting of acute PCP infection and concern for
immune reconstitution. Arrangements were made for outpatient
follow up with ID (see discharge plan information). Details of
acquisition not discussed in detail but per patient he thinks
likely within past 6 months. Please note that his family and HCP
(his superior) do not know; at this point, pt is not ready to
tell them. As pt was able to tolerate POs, both meds and food,
and began having more normal BMs, pt was transitioned to PO
bactrim per ID to complete his course of abx.
.
# Acute Pancreatitis: Likely drug-induced, possibly from lasix
initially given with concern for CHF. Initially asymptomatic,
found by chest CT which peripancreatic fluid tracking into left
pararenal space. Lipase was noted to be elevated at 1446 and
amylase at 455. RUQ ultrasound showed fatty infiltration of
liver but otherwise no biliary ductal dilatation and no
peripancreatic fluid collection. Treated with bowel rest and
IVF. Lipase rapidly resolved. Pt was then able to advance diet
and take POs.
.
# Crohn's: dx in [**Location (un) 7349**] by colonoscopy ~9 months prior to
admission. Previously treated with Asacol but stopped due to
poor toleration. On bunetinide oral steroids at time of
admission in addition to PO cipro and flagyl which was started
~3 months prior to admission for bloody diarrhea with good
results (these were all stopped and NOT restarted at discharge).
Evaluated by GI in house and felt appropriate for outpatient
follow up. However, given HIV status, ID was concerned that a
diagnosis of Crohn's so late in life was unusually and felt that
another OI may be the cause given pt's CD4 was 10. CMV and LGV
were both negative. ID and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] scheduled, will arrange
GI follow-up as other issues are address and concern for other
OI ruled out.
.
Pt was full code during admission.
Pt was transferred to rehab facility to complete his recover. He
will follow-up with ID; pt will arrange GI follow-up at a later
date as an outpt.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to have
worsening shortness of breath, leg swelling, fever, diarrhea and
weight loss. Becuase your condition was very grave, you were
admitted to the ICU for care. Inititally, there was concern that
you had heart failure and you received medications that helped
to remove the excess fluid from your body that was contributing
to your worsening respiratory status. Later it was determined
that you had a very serious pneumonia and that you were
immunocompromised. You required significant supplemental oxygen
to help you keep the level of oxygen in your blood at a safe
level. You were started on IV antibiotics. Initially, you had
difficulting taking anything by mouth because of severe nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea; this was improved by bowel rest, IV
medication and supportive care. You continued to improve and
were able to be transferred out of the ICU to the regular
medicine floor. You supplemenatly oxygen needs decreased and
your respiratory status improved. As your diarrhea, nausea and
vomitting had subsided and you were able to take food and
medicine effectively by mouth. You were then able to be
discharge to a rehabilitation facility to complete your
recovery.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
- Please START taking Bactrim DS 3tabs three times a day to
complete a 21 day course started on [**12-15**] and ending on [**1-5**].
You will likely need to remain on a lower dose of Bactrim after
you complete the current course; this lower dose will help to
prevent future pneumonias of the same type. Please be sure to
discuss this with your doctors.
- Please START taking prednisone 40mg PO daily for 5 days
(started on [**2188-12-20**] to end on [**2188-12-25**]), follwoed by 20mg
prednisone daily for an additional 11 days for a total of 3 wk
course to end on [**1-5**].
- Please START taking Azithromycin 1200 mg PO/NG 1X/WEEK (every
FRIDAY)
- Please START taking Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily
- Please STOP taking Ethenocort, Hydrochlorothiazide,
Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. The need for these medication should
be discussed with your doctors as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] or may not need to
restart them or a different medication may be prescribed.
Please be sure to take all medication as prescribed.
.
Also, you will need to have weekly blood labs performed to
follow your red blood cell count given your anemia. This will be
important for management and treatment purposes. Please discuss
this with your docotrs.
.
Please be sure to keep all follow-up appointments with your PCP
and other healthcare providers.
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you a speedy
recovery.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2178-6-30**]):    NO GROWTH.

CXR: FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were
obtained.  The heart is of normal size with normal
cardiomediastinal contours.  Bilateral streaky linear perihilar
opacities are compatible with reactive airway disease,
progressed since [**2175**] and similar to [**2178-5-16**].  The lungs
are otherwise clear.  No lobar consolidation, pleural effusion,
or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.  No
radiopaque foreign bodies.
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral streaky perihilar opacities, compatible
with reactive airway disease, similar to [**2178-5-16**] though
progressed since [**2176-9-13**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an exacerbation of his
reactive airway disease, asthma vs COPD vs bronchiectasis. He
was started on standing bronchodilator nebs and prednisone 60mg
daily and admitted to the ICU. His CXR showed no PNA. His
respiratory status improved dramatically in the next 24h and his
oxygen sat was 97% RA with ambulation. He was encouraged to quit
smoking again and provided script for nicotine lozenges. He was
discharged with a plan to taper prednisone in the following
manner: take 60mg x 4 days, 50mg x 4 days, 40mg x 4 days, then
return to usual dose of 30mg daily. He should likely have a high
res CT chest as an outpatient to eval for bronchiectasis. He may
also have an element of COPD contributing to this picture. He
will follow up with PCP in next few days, pulmonary next month.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25006**] is a 72 year old female with a history of stage
IIIA carcinosarcoma of the uterus, stage I mucinous carcinoma of
the ovary, rheumatoid arthritis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
with aortic stenosis who presents with hypotension.  The patient
states that she has had SBP in the upper 80s to 90s for the past
month.  Yesterday, her VNA noted that she was hypotensive into
the 80s and the patient felt lightheaded.  She went to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  At the OSH ED she had erythema noted around her
ankles bilaterally and low grade temps, but no leukocytosis.
She was found to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of
2.2.  In the ED she received IVFs at 1/2 NS at 100 cc/hr with
blood pressures improving to the 90s (which is her baseline);
she was mentating well.  She was empirically covered with Zosyn.
 Her CXR was clear, however she was mildly hypoxemic after
receiving IVF for her hypotension.  Normally, she does not have
an oxygen requirement and is 96 - 97% on room air, however she
was noted to be 88-89%, with ABG showing: 7.39/39/57/24 on room
air.  V/Q scan and LENIs were obtained given hypoxia and were
negative. Zosyn was stopped and she was started on cefepime and
vancomycin. Serial troponins were also negative.  BNP 371.  This
evening she was receiving 1/2NS at 100 cc/hr prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the ICU the patient was comfortable and denied any
shortness of breath.  She has had increasing bilateral lower
extremity edema for the past two months.  She believes the
redness in her legs came on suddenly yesterday, but does recall
having similar redness in her legs toward the end of her
chemotherapy several years ago.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI, + chills after chemo for a few hours, resolved.
(-) Denies fever. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea
or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest
pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias.

[**4-13**] CXR:
Severe cardiac enlargement has increased, consistent with
progressive
cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. The most significant
change has
been the great increase in size of multiple large pulmonary
nodules. There is no good evidence for pneumonia and none for
pulmonary edema, nor is pleural effusion substantial.
.
[**4-14**] Echo:
IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied, hyperdynamic left ventricle.
There is a severe resting LVOT gradient. The aortic valve is
severely thickened with significant stenosis (unable to estimate
valve are due to difficulty in measuring LVOT diameter and
presence of LVOT obstruction). Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Small, circumferential effusion without evidence
of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-2-3**],
the findings are similar.
.
[**4-14**] ECG:
Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats and ST-T wave
abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2121-2-17**] the rate is faster and the
QRS voltage in lead aVL is less prominent with a more vertical
axis. ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
.
[**4-16**] CTA:
1. Interval progression with larger pulmonary metastases,
adenopathy and new hepatic metastasis.
2. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Mild pulmonary artery dilation with moderate pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25006**] is a 72 year old female with stage IIIA
carcinosarcoma of the uterus and a stage I mucinous carcinoma of
the ovary undergoing carboplatin chemotherapy who presents with
hypotension.

# Hypotension - Etiology remained unclear. Differential
diagnosis included sepsis (perhaps [**3-18**] cellulitis of LE's, but
without other obvious infectious source), hypovolemia (but
appeared volume overloaded on exam), CHF with 3rd spacing of
volume but intravascular volume depletion, versus medication
(chemotherapy) side effect.  Differential also included
pericardial effusion and tamponade - ruled out by TTE. With
treatment of CHF (diuresis with one-time doses of lasix) and of
cellulitis (with antibiotics), saw patient's BP improve.
Antihypertensives held during hospitalization and on discharge.
Appears patient's baseline SBP is in the 90s. Patient ambulated
without lightheadedness.
.
# Hypoxia - Developed in OSH ED after she received IVF for her
hypotension; in the setting of AS and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, likely became volume overloaded. Was voume
overloaded on exam, with crackles, peripheral edema, weight
elevation, BNP elevation. Other possibilites include worsening
of HOCM, or worsened diffuse pulmonary metastasis as seen on CT
in [**2121-2-14**] which may have further reduced pulmonary
reserve. With diuresis, patient's oxygen requirement resolved,
albeit slowly. CTA was done to rule out PE - negative for PE.
Patient ambulated without SOB and without desaturation. In fact,
SpO2 improved with ambulation, so perhaps there was an
atelectatic component (heard as crackles at the bases perhaps)
that improved with opening up of airways upon ambulation.
.
# Cellulitis - Bilateral erythema and warmth of lower legs on
exam.  Could be cellulitis vs. hyperemia from edema vs. reaction
to chemotherapy medications (patient reports redness in legs
previously when on this chemotherapy regimen). Patient treated
with vancomycin and then keflex. Patient diuresed with lasix
one-time doses.
.
# Acute renal failure - Baseline creatinine around 1 and 1.0 on
[**4-10**].  Was 2.2 at OSH and became 1.3 after getting IV hydration.
Seemed pre-renal etiology given improvement in creatinine w/ IV
fluids; then patient was diuresed for CHF/volume overload
concern, and Cr continued to improve down to 0.8.
.
# Tachycardic runs - appear to be SVT (narrow complex, regular,
no P waves, came on/off suddenly), seen intermittently and
asymptomatic. Ruled out PE with CTA.
.
# Normocytic Anemia - Was 32.8 at OSH; after receiving fluids
HCT has fallen further to 30. Baseline is 35 - 40. Not
clinically bleeding. Perhaps due to chemotherapy.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - 137 down from 700 earlier. Likely  related
to marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
.
# Asthma history? - continued home regimen of singulair,
fluticasone prn, and formulary exchange maxair with albuterol.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia - patient no longer taking fenofibrate
d/t concern for possible side effects.  Takes fluvastatin every
other day - formulary exchanged with pravastatin.
.
# Uterine & Ovarian cancer - plan for next chemotherapy on
Thursday [**4-24**], as an inpatient, due to concerns for side
effects and desire for o/n monitoring.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with low oxygen, low blood
pressure, and leg redness/swelling. We believe that your
symptoms were due to fluid overload, so you were diuresed with
lasix and your breathing (oxygen level) improved. We ruled out a
clot in the lungs, and did an echocardiogram to show that your
heart function was similar to previously. We are treating you
for a skin infection of the legs, with antibiotics, and your
legs are improving in terms of their redness, pain, and
swelling. It is unclear why your blood pressure was low, but
with diuresis (fluid removal) and treatment of infection, your
blood pressure improved up to baseline.
.
You spent time in the ICU, and then on the regular oncology
floor.
.
On discharge, you were walking well without a need for oxygen,
your blood pressure had improved/elevated, and your leg symptoms
were improving.
.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
- take Keflex (cephalexin), an antibiotic, twice a day until the
evening of [**4-19**]
- do NOT take your Hyzaar (HCTZ/Losartan) or Verapamil, until
next week when you see your cardiologist or come to the hospital
for chemotherapy (we are holding these medications temporarily
because of your borderline-low blood pressure)
.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop
chest pain, shortness of breath, weight gain greater than 2
pounds, palpitations, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain,
worsening leg swelling/redness/pain, lightheadedness.

Followup Instructions:
Please come to [**Hospital1 18**] and go to the [**Location (un) 436**] of the [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**]
building on Thursday [**4-24**], at approximately 9 AM. Please
present to the Oncology front desk. You will then have
chemotherapy that day, and spend that night overnight in the
hospital.

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain, Nausea, Vomitting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 64236**] is a 26 y/o man with IDDM for 8 years who presents
with several days of nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain. Two
weeks ago, he was diagnosed with sinusitis/sinus infection and
given antibiotics. He first noticed epigastric abdominal pain
about one week ago, constant, without relation to food. It was a
strong, sharp pain that did not radiate. Notably, he had been
taking ibuprofen 800 mg q3h for headache associated with
sinusitis at that time. In past 2-3 days noticed increased
nausea with vomiting. Denies hematemesis. Notes that he last
kept something liquid down yesterday morning, but vomitted up
everything (both liqiuds and solids) through the day and night.
Thus, he came to [**Hospital1 18**] ED that night. Took insulin during that
time intermittently but this is typical for him.
.
His insulin control and FSG checking has chronically been very
poor. He admits to taking insulin about 5 times per week.
Further, when he does take it, he taked a standing dose of 10U
Reg and 30U of 70/30. He takes his FSG about 1 per month due to
discomfort with the prick. He has chronic polyuria and
polydypsia. He reports getting regular vision checks with [**Last Name (un) **]
center and no knowledge of neuropathy, kidney disease, or eye
problems.
.
On ROS, he denies HA, changes in vision, hearing, or swallowing.
No fever, sweats, chills, weight loss. He eats very well. No CP,
palps, PND, orthopnea. No SOB, pain with breathing, cough,
wheeze. No recent bowel of bladder dysfunction. No troubles with
limb weakness, sensory changes, poor coordination. He does feel
episodes of hypoglycemia if he does not eat following insulin:
sweating, palpitations, and anxiety.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Diabetic ketoacidosis, IDDM with features of insulin
resistance.


Discharge Condition:
Good


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for diabetic keto-acidosis.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe and life threatening
condition that results from uncontrolled blood sugar. This
episode of DKA happened becuase you were not regularly taking
insulin and becuase your blood sugar was very high. Your recent
sinus infection could have also worsened your condition. As a
result of this condition, you required admission to the
intensive care unit. During your hospitalization, your blood
sugar, electrolytes, and metabolism, in general, were restored
to a more normal condition.

It is extremely important that you keep your blood sugars at
more normal levels or this life-threatening condition will
happen again. Also, you will develop eye problems, kidney
disease, worse leg numbness, and heart disease if your sugars
are not controlled better.

In order to control your sugars, you need to follow the Insulin
regimen that was prescribed by the [**Last Name (un) **] center. You will have
to take 2 types of insulin. You will take a dose of long acting
insulin (Lantus) every night and this dose will be constant. You
will take a dose of Humalog insulin before every meal based on
the sliding scale chart - thus you have to check your sugar at
this time.

If you find that you are unable to follow the above insulin
plan, you have to call your doctor at the [**Hospital **] clinic.

Due to your high use of Motrin before admission, you irritated
the lining of your stomach. Thus, we treated this problem with a
medicine to decrease the acid in your stomach called
pantoprazole. You should continue taking this medicine until you
see your PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 10748**] your stomach problem.

If you begin to again experience increasing nausea, vomitting,
abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptom, you should
contact your PCP or go to the ER.

Followup Instructions:
You need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3636**] for diabetes care.
Your first appointment is [**4-29**] at 4PM. This appointment is
very important!!!

You can call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17484**] and ask for Dr.[**Name (NI) 64238**] office if this
time does not work.

You need to schedule an appointment with you primary care doctor
within the next few weeks to followup your stomach pain after
taking Motrin.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Anasarca: The patient appeared to be total body overloaded by
intravascularly dry at admission. She [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] right heart
catheterization on [**2126-12-6**] that showed pulmonary hypertension
(systolic BP 45, diastolic BP 20, mean BP 28). She was therefore
started on sildenafil. The nephrology service was consulted, and
she diuresed well on a regimen on albumin, lasix, and
chlorthiazide (then metolazone). Her diuresis was discontinued
on [**1-8**] because of development of hypotension occuring in the
setting of a urinary tract infection. Subsequently, she was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension (see below) where
sildenafil was d/c'd as the patient was unlikely benefiting from
it in the setting of relatively mild to moderate pulmonary HTN
and overall systemic hypotension.

2. UTI: She developed a urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas
on [**12-15**] and was treated with a two week course of levofloxacin
then ciprofloxacin. A repeat urine culture was obtained for
followup on [**1-2**] although she was afebrile and had no urinary
complaints. This culture again grew out Pseudomonas, this time
quinolone resistant. Her foley catheter was changed, as she
refused to have it removed. She subsequently developed a fever
to 101.3 on [**1-7**] and was started on cefepime, with addition of
vancomycin and flagyl on [**1-8**]. Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
hypotension and tachycardia (see below), she was continued on
vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. A central venous line and
arterial line were placed under sterile conditions. After 24
hours in the ICU, the patient was on 3 pressors with the
differential diagnosis including septic vs. cardiogenic shock.
Meropenem was added as for double gram-negative and Psuedomonas
coverage. In spite of maximal medical therapy, the patient
remained maxed out on 3 pressors. A repeat family meeting was
held with the pt's HCP and mother, who agreed to make the
patient CMO. She expired shortly thereafter. An autospy was
offered, but declined.

3. Hypotension and tachycardia: She developed hypotension to the
70's sytolic on [**1-8**] which responded initially to fluid boluses.
Her hypotension was thought to reflect both aggressive diuresis
and possible urosepsis. She developed tachycardia to the 120's
on [**1-9**] with a new RBBB. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where
she was given adenosine 6 mg X 2 with conversion to sinus
tachycaria after the second dose of adenosine. However, she went
back into a wide complex tachycardia with a RBBB pattern soon
thereafter. The cardiology team evaluated her and felt that this
rhythm was most likely an SVT with rate related aberancy;
however the following day, after reviewing the EKG strips with
the EP attending, the patient was determined to have a fasicular
ventricular tachycardia in the setting of no known prior CAD or
ischemic scar. The treatment of choice in this setting would
have been verapimil; however this was not feasible as the
patient was already on 3 pressors (neo, levophed, and
vasopressin). The following day, a dose of verapimil was tried
given concern for possibly worsening cardiogenic shock (however
the patient's extremities remained warm to palpation, which
suggested likely septic shock) with conversion back to sinus
tachycardia. She was not cardioverted secondary to the patient's
wishes to remain DNR/DNI. Given the patient's lack of
improvement in spite of maximal medical care, the patient was
made CMO after another family meeting and expired shortly
thereafter.

3. C. diff colitis: She experienced loose stools after admission
and a stool sample was positive for C. diff toxin on [**12-8**]; she
was subsequently treated with a 14 day course of flagyl. This
was restarted on [**1-8**] as noted above in the context of recurrent
fever and increased stooling.

4. Right basilic vein thrombosis: The patient's PICC line was
removed and she was started on IV heparin and then coumadin. Her
anticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of heme positive
stools and widely varying INR (thought likely to be due to
interactions with her many medications). A repeat ultrasound of
the upper extremity showed no evidence of persistent thrombus
therefore she was not continued on further anticoagulation.

5. AML with history of GVHD: She was continued on cyclosporine,
Cellcept, and her prednisone was titrated down per BMT
recommendations.

6. Elevated LFTs: Her transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and
bilirubin were moderately elevated and thought to be secondary
to GVHD of the liver after review of her medication list and
right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no other clear causes
of these findings. Her alkaline phosphatase elevation was
probably due at least in part to her bony disease as the bone
specific fraction was elevated as well.

7. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 1.3 at
admission peaking at 1.9. She was thought to be intravascularly
dry with prerenal failure. Her creatinine improved with addition
of albumin to her diuretic regimen consistent with this.

8. Pulmonary hypertension: Ms. [**Known lastname 28331**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] right heart
catheterization on [**12-7**] to assess whether pulmonary
hypertension might be contributing to her significant edema.
This study showed mean pulmonary pressures of 28 and she was
subsequently started on sildenafil, which was subsequently d/c'd
upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (see above).

9. Heme positive stools: As noted above, she had heme positive
stools in the setting of anticoagulation with IV heparin and
warfarin and recent C. difficile colitis infectoin. In addition,
she had a prior history of gastritis on endoscopy and was
receiving steroids for her GVHD. She was started on a PPI and
her Hct was followed closely.

10. Hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency: The patient's
PTH was rechecked as the differential for her bone changes noted
on plain films included osteitis fibrosa. She was evaluated by
the endocrinology consult service who felt that her
hyperparathyroidism was likely secondary, perhaps due to renal
failure or steroid use. Her vitamin D levels were rechecked and
found to be low. She was started on weekly vitamin D and daily
calcium. She will need repeat vitamin D studies and should
follow up with endocrinology for further management. She was
started on a bisphosphonate per endocrine recs.

11. Pulmonary osteoarthropathy: She complained of diffuse body
pains and aches. Imaging of her extremities was notable for
diffuse periosteal reaction. The endocrinology service reviewed
the films and felt the history and imaging were most consistent
with pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Her pain was treated with oral
dilaudid as needed for pain control.

12. Eye pains: Ms. [**Known lastname 28331**] complained of eye soreness. This was
thought to be secondary to GVHD. She was started on cyclosporin
eye drops and artificial tears. She was evaluated by the
opthalmology consult service who recommended addition of Refresh
eye drops which she continued with relief of her symptoms.

parietal edema and small foci of hemorrhage, though the images
were not sent with the patient upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. According
to discharge paperwork from [**Hospital3 **] today, the patient
originally presented to the hospital on [**2144-12-21**] with
intractable nausea and vomiting of 5 days duration. While at
[**Hospital3 **], the patient had several abdominal films as well as
an upper GI series which were reportedly unremarkable.
Physicians were concerned that there was a central cause of
nausea and attempted head imaging, which the patient initially
refused. Late on night of [**2144-10-23**], patient was found to be
minimally responsive with head turning to right and arms flexed
to chest. As he had received nortriptyline, there was initial
concern for a dystonic reaction and 50 mg IV diphenhydramine was
pushed. There was no improvement in his mental status following
that intervention and he was intubated for ariway protection and
head CT was then performed with results as above. Transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] was requested given patient's decline in mental status
requiring intubation.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 5016**]
on [**12-14**] with hypercalcemia and a pseudomonas infection of stage
IV pressure ulcer. He completed antibiotic course of
ceftazidime, daptomycin, and azithromycin.

Unknown level of ambulation immediately prior to presentation to
[**Hospital6 5016**] on [**2144-12-21**]; however, at time of discharge
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-11-12**], he could stand and walk about 10 feet.
A recent neurology note from [**2144-12-4**] assessed his IP strength
as being 1 on the right and 0 on the left. He was assessed as
having ""residual severe paraparesis due to combination of
deconditioning and vincristine toxic polyneuropathy, and
question of critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy.""

CT head [**12-24**]
1. Limited study due to patient motion despite five repeat
attempts.
2. Round mild densities in the temporal lobes, and possibly
increased density interdigitating with the sulci. Note
additional history obtained of Burkitt's lymphoma. The findings
may relate to lymphoma involvement, less likely parenchymal and
subarachnoid hemorrhage, though not quite as dense as typical
hemorrhage products, especially in temporal lobes.
3. Enlarged pituitary gland, better evaluated on recent MR
pituitary.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4011**] at 9:00 p.m.
[**2144-12-24**], at which time MRI had been ordered and the patient had
been brought for MRI.

[**12-25**] MRI, MRV, MRA head
1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
involving the right greater than left temporal and parietal
lobes, with more focal areas of parenchymal abnormality in the
temporal lobe, also right greater than left.  Differential
diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent lymphoma
(especially given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma)
as well as a meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis,
although other viral or bacterial meningoencephalitides could
also result in a similar appearance.

2. Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the
leptomeningeal disease with additional foci involving the right
thalamus and right hippocampus, which may represent acute
infarcts, although they may be related to lymphomatous
involvement versus infectious process given the findings above.
Hypoxic injury would be a less likely differential
consideration.

3. Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion. There is no
definite
evidence of venous thrombosis, although the sigmoid sinuses and
the visualized internal jugular veins are suboptimally
evaluated.

4. No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the
MRA of the
head, although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery
raises the possibility of a small aneurysm. This was
suboptimally evaluated given the degree of patient motion. At
the time of followup imaging, the MRA sequence could be
repeated.

5. Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior
examination when accounting for differences in technique,
although dedicated imaging of the sella was not obtained today.

[**12-25**]
TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is probably mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-8-13**],
the LVEF is less vigorous. The pericardial effusion is slightly
larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade.

[**12-27**] Chest Xray
The endotracheal tube is no longer visualized. This is a rotated

film. There is bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis.
The right
Port-A-Cath is unchanged.

[**12-28**] CT Head
Relatively stable vasogenic edema in the temporal lobes as well
as leptomeningeal hyperdensity and hyperdensity in the left
temporal lobe. Question of increased hypodensity in the mid
brain, recommend correlation with MRI to exclude the possibility
of ischemia.

[**12-29**] Chest Xray
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
change. No evidence of pneumothorax, no pleural effusion. Mild
retrocardiac atelectasis. No focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia, no overhydration.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell
lymphoma (s/p admission at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**])
who was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] following episode
of altered mental status early on day of admission, [**12-24**], that
led to intubation for airway protection.

#. Lymphoma: He initially presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with
nausea and vomiting.  On admission here, an LP was done that
showed a high opening pressure (49) and multiple atypical cells
concerning for recurrent CNS lymphoma.  He was started on
high-dose Decadron and was followed by Medical Oncology,
Neuro-oncology, and Radiation Oncology.  His presenting symptoms
were considered a consequence of his worsening lymphoma.  Given
his previous treatments with intrathecal chemotherapy, he was
not considered a candidate for chemotherapy.  He began
palliative full brain XRT on [**2144-12-28**].  His clinical condition
deteriorated and his respiratory status worsened and he was only
able to have one treatment. On [**2144-12-29**] a discussion with the
health care proxy led to Mr. [**Known lastname **] being made comfort measures
only.  He died on [**2144-12-31**] at 4:40pm.

#. Altered mental status:  His AMS was most likely caused by
recurrent CNS lymphoma and increased intracranial pressure.  He
was initially treated with Acyclovir for HSV, however this was
stopped due to low clinical suspicion. His mental status did not
improve off sedation.  His mental status deteriorated to the
point where he was not responsive, likely related to his CNS
lymphoma and increased ICP.

#. Endotracheal intubation/extubation: He was intubated for
airway protection at an OSH prior to admission.  He
self-extubated two days after admission without complication.
He remained off ventilatory support and became hypoxic three
days prior to death but was made comfort measures only.

#. Pneumonia: At admission, he spiked a temperature, had copious
secretions and a consolidation in the RUL on chest x-ray.
Vancomycin and Cefepime were started on [**12-25**] for a planned 8
day course, which was stopped early when the goals of care were
changed.

#. Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:  He had a history of a
pituitary adenoma and surgical resection had been planned for
future.  This was deferred due to his poor clinical status.

#. Sacral decubitus ulcer:  He had a stage IV sacral ulcer with
recent pseudomonal infection. It appeared uninfected on
admission and was followed by the wound care team.

#. Code Status: He was initially full code during this
hospitalization, but after he clinically worsened with severe
alteration in mental status, he was made DNR/DNI and eventually
comfort measures only.

#. Emergency Contact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 40169**] (Health Care Proxy): Primary

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2165-12-18**], he underwent liver transplant. Surgeon as Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Induction immunosuppression was administered. Please
refer to operative note for complete details. Two JPs were
placed.  During dissection a small defect was made in the
diaphragm.  This was closed with a figure-of-eight silk suture
after evacuating the pneumothorax using a red rubber catheter
placed to suction. He did very well and was transferred to the
SICU postop for management. A CXR demonstrated a increased size
of right apical pneumothorax and right upper lobe collapse. A
chest tube was placed with improvement. Chest tube was removed
on [**12-21**]. Postop LFTs initially increased then trended down
daily. He remained hemodynamically stable. JP drains were
non-bilious. Postop, liver duplex showed patent vasculature and
no ductal dilatation.

He was transferred out of the SICU to the med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit where he
made daily progress. Diet was advanced and tolerated. He
required insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia secondary to
steroids. He became independent with ambulation. JPs were
removed. He did well with immunosuppression teaching. Steroids
were tapered per protocol. Cellcept was well tolerated. Prograf
was initiated on postop day 0. Trough levels were done daily
with dose adjustments. Prograf was increased to 9mg [**Hospital1 **] for a
trough of 5 on [**12-24**].

He experienced intractable hiccoughs as a result of the
diaphragm repair. He did receive a couple low doses of thorazine
with temporary relief.

Due to sulfa allergy, bactrim was not ordered for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. He received a Pentamidine inhalation treatment on
[**12-23**]. He also received a Pamidronate treatment on [**12-24**] for
osteopenia.

He was discharged home with instructions to check his blood
sugar prior to breakfast and supper. He will follow up in the
outpatient clinic on [**1-2**]. Labs will be drawn on [**12-26**].

Chief Complaint:
melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagoduodenoscopy with cauterization and injection duodenal
ulcer.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 59 yo woman s/p gastric bypass c/b bowel
obstruction and ventral hernia repairs who presents with black
tarry stools for one day.  The patient was in her usual state of
health until the afternoon of [**8-27**], when she started to have
crampy abdominal pain and the urge to defecate while driving
home from work.  She subsequently had 4-5 episodes of large
volume, dark brown, tarry, malodorous stool over several hours.
These bowel movements also contained small streaks of maroon
colored blood.  She had some transient lightheadedness after her
first bowel movement, but no LOC, palpiations, or CP.  She also
denies any nausea, vomiting, or retching.  She had no changes in
her stool color, consistency, or caliper prior to the onset of
melena, and s/p gastric bypass had no symptoms dumping syndrome.
 She has had no known sick contacts, or recent weight loss,
fevers or chills.  She  has a recent history of starting an
NSAID, Voltaren, for OA pain several months ago.  She has had
EGD in the distant past, but has not ever had a colonoscopy.
.
ED Course:  On arrival to the E.D., the patient had no abominal
pain, and was no longer having large-volume stools.  She did
have several additional small volume black stools over the day
on [**8-28**].  She was tachycardic to the 110s, SBP to 140s, which
improved with IVF.  Her Hct was found to be 31, down from a
baseline of 39 by patient report.  She was found to have brown
stool, guaiac positive.  She had a negative NG lavage.  She was
started on an IV PPI and transferred to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
GI:  On transfer to the floor, the patient had initially had a
SBP of 100 down from 140 in the ED, but repeat was 120/80, and
she remained hemodynamically stable.  However, Hct trended down
from 31 to 25, and she was transferred to the ICU for closer
monitoring and EGD.  She recieved 2 units PRBCs, with Hct bump
to 28.9.  EGD was remarkable for a single cratered 15mm ulcer
with oozing from the edges just distal to the gastrojejunal
anastomosis, which was injected with epinephrine and cauterized
successfully for hemostasis.  Post-procedure, she was
hemodynamically stable, her Hct was 30.3, and she was
transferred back to the floor.  Once back on the floor, she did
very well, and remained hemodynamically stable.  She had no
abdominal pain, nausesa or vomiting.  Her Hct at discharge was
stable at 32.2, and her diet was advanced to regular.  She had
not yet had a bowel movement post-procedure, but was passing
gas.  She was discharged on hige dose PPI to follow-up with her
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2 weeks and GI for repeat EGD and biopsy in 1 month.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old
gentleman with a history of Hodgkin's disease was transferred
here from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital because of intractable seizures
and decreased mental status.

He was in his usual state of health, active and playing golf,
until [**8-17**] when he began to become ""confused"" and developed
gait difficulties.  According to the family, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
behaving in a way that was perceived to be nontypical by family
members. [**Name (NI) **] was also having gait difficulties that were
considered to be mild, according to the family members.

Because of these symptoms, he was evaluated at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
on [**8-17**]. At that time, a head computed tomography was
reported as normal. He was give a diagnosis of transient ischemic
attacks and was d/c home.

Over the next three days, Mr. [**Known lastname **] problems gradually
worsened.  On [**8-20**], he was at home when he developed a
nonfocal onset of seizure which was later generalized.    He
was transferred to the nearest Emergency Department where he
continued to have generalized seizures.  He was given a
Dilantin load and phenobarbital.  His systolic blood pressure
at that time ranged between 120 and 200s.

A repeat head CT was reported to be normal. Despite the Dilantin
load and the phenobarbiltal, the patient continued to have
clinical seizured. Therefore, he was started on an Ativan drip
and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. His Dilantin was
also continued on therapeutic levels.  Despite the Ativan drip
and Dilantin therapeutic levels, Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to be
unresponsive and had intermittent seizures. The rate of the
Ativan IV infusion was increased and the patient was intubated. A
lumbar puncture was performed on [**8-20**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
and showed normal values.

A MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging showed diffuse
hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex (R > L) and both thalami.

At this point, the patient remained intubated and unresponsive
and was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
care.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [**2106-4-11**] after
developing a respiratory infection.  This was diagnosed as
nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease; stage III-B with
positive [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells.  A bone marrow biopsy was done
in [**2106-8-11**] which showed no bone marrow involvement.
2.  Status post chemotherapy with bleomycin, Cytoxan,
vincristine, and procarbazine two years ago.  This had to be
discontinued after three cycles because of interstitial lung
disease and because of myelosuppression with episodes of
neutropenic fever.  Most recent surveillance computed
tomography scan revealed gradual interval progression of
Hodgkin's disease with slightly large mediastinal lymph
nodes.
3.  Borderline hypertension.
4.  Colonic polyps.
5.  Tuberculosis.
6.  Cataracts.
7.  Macular degeneration.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Prevacid, and Tylenol.
Ativan drip and Dilantin were started at the outside
hospital.

ALLERGIES:  CEFTIN (causes a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a retired chemistry teacher
and lived in [**Hospital3 **].  He was married with no alcohol or
intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2107-8-23**]. A repeat LP on admission showed normal cells, glucose
and protein. A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures
and different viral and fungal Ab titers (including West Nile
Virus, Arboviruses, HSV, HBVs). Routine cultures for bacterial,
TB and other infectious agents were also normal. Cytology was
normal.

Despite the therapeutic levels of PTN and the IV infusion of
Ativan, electroencephalogram (EEG) on admission showed
epileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoing
epileptict activity. Therefore, a Penotarbital infusion was
started. The Pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain a
burst- suppression pattern on bedside 24 h, EEG monitoring. In
particular, the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10
seconds. Dilantin and Depakote were continued as well. At this
point, pressors were started to compensate to the Pentobarbital-
induced decreased cardiac function.

Mr [**Known lastname **] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance
imaging examination ([**8-24**]) showed multicentric areas of T2
hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as
well as bilateral thalami. Laboratory studies throughout Mr.
[**Known lastname **] admission included several blood cultures, urine cultures
and extensive toxic metabolic workup. Another LP for
cerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection, toxic metabolic and
cytological analysis was also performed.

In order to better elucidate the underlying pathology. A brain
and meningeal biopsy was performed on [**8-24**] in the right
frontal lobe.

In regards to empiric treatment, after the brain biopsy, the
patient received IV Solu- Medrol and high doses of antibiotics
with broad coverage.  The Infectious Disease team was also
involved in the care of Mr. [**Known lastname **]. All the tests performed on his
tissues and fuids obtained under request of the ID team, had
thus far come back normal.

Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic
eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal
damage (red neurons). There was no evidence of an infectious
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.

Several attempts in decreasing the dose of Pentobarbital resulted
in an increased epileptiform activity on bedside EEG monitor.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] condition deteriorated even further. He had developed
ileus, and his abdomen was hyperextended.  He had been intubated
throughout his entire stay in the Intensive Care Unit and was
increasingly dependent on ventilatory support.

At this point, the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosis
was thoroughly discussed with his closest family members. After
a family meeting, it was decided that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would no longer
benefit from aggressive support.  Therefore, he was extubated
and expired briefly thereafter.

[**3-16**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

[**3-16**] CT Torso:
1. Inflammatory change of the right colon and mesenteric/portal
venous gas is highly concerning for ischemia.
2. Extensive right diffuse airspace opacification in a pattern
that suggests aspiration or bronchopneumonia.

[**3-16**] Upper GI Endoscopy:
Findings: Esophagus: Excavated Lesions [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear was
seen in the gastroesophageal junction.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema, congestion and friability of the
mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in the antrum. These
findings are compatible with gastritis.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Erythema, congestion and friability in the antrum
compatible with gastritis. [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: No active bleeding seen, no varices. Continue
PPI twice daily. Continue to monitor Hct and transfuse to
Hct>26.

CTA abdomen/pelvis ([**3-17**]): The lung bases demonstrate scattered
patchy opacities which are more prominent on the right and may
represent small foci of pneumonia. There are small bilateral
effusions, right greater than left. Heart size is normal. There
is no pericardial effusion. The liver, spleen, adrenals,
pancreas and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are
unremarkable. Post-cholecystectomy changes are stable. The
imaged venous and arterial vessels are patent. Wall thickening
and stranding along the hepatic flexure to the mid ascending
colon is slightly less conspicuous since [**2193-3-16**]. There are no
definite areas of pneumatosis, with air in the non dependant
portions of the cecum (3a:91-116) likely representing air. The
kidneys enhance and secrete contrast symmetrically. The imaged
small bowel is unremarkable. CT PELVIS: The rectum, prostate and
sigmoid are unremarkable. The bladder demonstrates a Foley
catheter and a small amount of air. Bone windows demonstrate no
evidence of lesions that is suspicious for metastatic or
infectious focus, with multilevel degenerative changes in the
thoracolumbar spine which are similar to [**2193-3-16**]. A linear
lucency along the superior right acetabulum (3B:372) likely
represents nondisplaced fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. There is no evidence of ischemia with resolution of portal
venous and
mesenteric air since yesterday. Colitis involving the hepatic
flexure to the mid ascending colon is less prominent since
yesterday.
2. Likely Nondisplaced right acetabulum rim fracture.

CXR ([**3-19**]): Bilateral airspace with greater involvement on the
right is
slightly improved. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Heart size
and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Old rib fracture noted
on the right. IMPRESSION: Improving aspiration pneumonitis or
pneumonia.

Microbiology:
urine cx ([**3-16**]) negative
blood cx ([**3-16**]) no growth to date
MRSA screen ([**3-16**]) negative
Influenza a/b antigen negative ([**3-16**])
C diff toxin negative ([**3-18**])

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 51 y/o M w/ hep C who presented with UGIB after 3d of
high dose ibuprofen for new dx of myopericarditis manifested by
coffee ground emesis and aspiration pneumonia.

# GI Bleed: Evidence of gastritis and [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear on
endoscopy with hematocrits stable after 2 U prbcs given in the
ICU. He also had a new finding of colitis on colonoscopy but
this was not likely source for bleed. He has tolerated PO BID
PPI and should continue this until follow up with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
should avoid NSAIDs.
- PPI [**Hospital1 **]
- Monitor Hct daily

# Aspiration pneumonia: The patient presented after vomiting
with fever, elevated WBC count, and CXR/CT findings of
infiltrate, making pneumonia likely [**2-25**] to aspiration of gastric
contents. He was negative for influenza on admission. His
infiltrate persisted over days. He will finish a 14-day course
of levofloxacin/flagyl (for both pneumonia and colitis) on
[**2193-3-31**]. Sputum culture was contaminated but did not show MRSA so
vancomycin discontinued on transfer to medical floor.
Supplemental oxygen was used as necessary to maintain oxygen
saturation > 92%.

# Tachycardia: Tachycardia on admission resolved with volume
repletion, likely resultant from bleeding. He denied recent
alcohol use on admission. He does take benzodiazepines as an
outpatient so this was continued. Tamponade was considered but
echocardiogram showed a trivial pericardial effusion. He
tolerated beta blockade once blood pressure and hematocrit were
found to be stable.

# Myo-pericarditis: Enzymes were trending down on admission.
Echo showed trivial effusion as above. Continued beta blockade.


# Colitis: Unclear etiology but considered etiologies include
ischemic vs. inflammatory. Surgery evaluated the patient after
portal gas was seen on his first CT chest; on repeat CTA the
next day, there was no evidence of portal gas. He was maintained
NPO/sips for bowel rest and then regular diet was restarted
without any adverse effects. He will receive a total 14 day
treatment with levofloxacin 500 mg daily and flagyl 500 mg TID.
This will end on [**2193-3-31**]. The patient was C diff toxin
negative X 2. He will need an outpatient colonoscopy once this
acute episode resolves. Pain was controlled with PO morphine.

# Acetabular rim fracture: The patient was found to have a
fracture on CT scan of the abdomen. Orthopedic consultation was
obtained who recommended two months of touchdown weight bearing
and two months of posterior hip dislocation precautions. He will
follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] in
orthopedics. Once hematocrit stabilized he was started on
lovenox 40 mg daily to continue until fully ambulatory.

# Hepatitis: No evidence of varices on endoscopy. Should resume
prior follow up plan.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 36 year old gentleman with a PMH signifciant
with dilated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD, asthma, and HTN admitted
to an OSH with dyspnea now admitted to the MICU after PEA arrest
x2. The patient initially presented to LGH ED with hypoxemic
respiratory distress. While at the OSH, he received CTX,
azithromycin, SC epinephrine, and solumedrol. While at the OSH,
he became confused and subsequently had an episode of PEA arrest
and was intubated. He received epinephrine, atropine, magnesium,
and bicarb. In addition, he had bilateral needle thoracostomies
with report of air return on the left, and he subsequently had
bilateral chest tubes placed.  After approximately 15-20 minutes
of rescucitation, he had ROSC. He received vecuronium and was
started on an epi gtt for asthma and a cooling protocol, and was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Of note, the
patient was admitted to LGH in [**1-4**] for dyspnea, and was
subsequently diagnosed with a CAP and asthma treated with CTX
and azithromycin. Per his family, he has also had multiple
admissions this winter for asthma exacerbations.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 35.3 102 133/58 100%AC 500x20, 5, 1.0 with an
ABG 7.16/66/162. He had a CTH which was unremarkable. He then
had a CTA chest, afterwhich he went into PEA arrest.
Rescucitation last approximately 10-15 minutes with multiple
rounds of epi and bicarb, with ROSC. He was then admitted to the
MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is intubated, sedated, and parlyzed.

pericardial
effusion, mediastinal hemorrhage, or acute cardiac failure.
Recommend
clinical correlation.
.
CTH: My read, no acute bleed
.
CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, although evaluation of
subsegmental branches is limited.
2. Moderate cardiomegaly without pericardial effusion.
3. Bilateral dependent atelectasis.
4. Multiple nondisplaced rib fractures on the right, some of
which are subacute. Also possible subtle nondisplaced fractures
of the left ribs.
5. Nondisplaced acute sternal fracture in addition to a subacute
nondisplaced sternal fracture.
.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. LV
systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ? 30
percent) with regional variation. There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
ECG (post-arrest):  Sinus with 1:1 conduction. LAA. LAD, RBBB,
LAFB. STD in V4-V6.
.
ECG (pre-arrest): Sinus with 1:1 conduction. LAD, bifascicular
block. No lateral STD.
.
ECG (OSH, unclear pre/post arrest): Sinus with 1:1 conduction.
Bifascicular (RBBB, LAFB) block. STD in V5-6.
.
EEG [**2-27**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the
slow and
disorganized background of 6.5 Hz with bursts of generalized
slowing
that showed no clear reactivity. These findings indicate a
severe
encephalopathy. This may be consistent with the patient's
history of
anoxia; however, toxic/metabolic disturbances, infection, and
medication
effects are also among the most frequent causes of
encephalopathy. No
clear epileptiform discharges or seizures were seen.

LUMBAR SPINE [**2115-3-11**]

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Evidence of fracture, seizure, fall, low
back pain.

FINDINGS:

Three views of the lumbar spine demonstrate mild narrowing of
the left
femoroacetabular joint. There is mild scoliosis of the
thoracolumbar spine.  The ventricular lead of a pacemaker is
identified. No fracture of L2 through L5 is identified. However,
there is a compression fracture of L1, with compression of the
superior endplate, and a sclerotic fracture line. Given the
mechanism of fall, if there is acute pain referable to L1, then
this would be considered an acute finding. There is no apparent
retropulsion of the posterior margin of L1 into the spinal
canal. No other fractures are identified at this time. Facet
joints are aligned. There is early calcification of the aorta.
IMPRESSION: Compression fracture of L1 with anterior wedge
deformity, likely an acute finding. No other fractures
identified.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Complete right bundle-branch block
with left anterior fascicular block. Diffuse ST-T wave changes
laterally.
CT Head:
COMPARISON: [**2115-2-22**].
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images were obtained through the
brain.
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation. Ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and configuration. The basilar cisterns are not
compressed. Paranasal sinuses demonstrate fluid in the sphenoid
air cells and right posterior ethmoid air cell, likely related
to prolonged hospitalization.  Mastoid air cells are well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 36 year old gentleman with a PMH signifciant
with dilated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD, PE not on anticoagulation,
asthma, and HTN admitted to an OSH with dyspnea now the
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU after PEA arrest x2.

# PEA arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury.: Suspect that
original OSH PEA arrest due to hypoxemia or acidosis, with [**Hospital1 18**]
ED PEA arrest due to acidosis with admission pH 7.16 on arrival.
 TTE with evidence of RV failure to suggest PE. LVEF 30% with
known dilated cardiomyopathy. He was cooled per protocol.
Initially, his EEG was concerning without evident brain
activity. On hospital day 3, there was only comatose activity
and his prognosis was guarded. However, the patient was able to
be weaned off the vent and over the course of the next three
days his mental status improved.  He was alert, oriented to
place and day of the week and moving all 4 extremities.  He
became more interactive on transfer to the floor, was initially
speaking in spanish and English and not always making sense but
then started responding more appropiately and following
commands.  On hospital day 11 he had a witnessed grand mal
seizure and was given ativan and started on Keppra with
neurology consult.  His mental status was worse for 24 hours
after the seizure but then he slowly returned to his recent
baseline.  He was somewhat aggitated so his Keppra was switched
to Topiramate. He had a subsequent seizure on [**3-18**] with LUE
tonic clonic activity and impaired consciousness but this
resolved spontaneously after 1-2 minutes. He was contineud on
topamax per neuro recommendations. OT and PT were consulted and
worked with the patient as he will likely require a long
rehabilitation course.  At the time of discharge the patient was
alert, oriented (though not always to date), following commands
but impulsive with poor motor planning leading to several falls.
 Neurology notes indicate the patient has the potential
toimprove from a neurologic standpoint. He also may have
recurrent seizures which should be treated with ativan IV or IM
and do not neccessarily indicate patient needs to return to
hospital unless they continue for greater than 5 minutes or he
has multiple recurrent seizures or complications such as
aspiration.
-patient will be on Topiramate 25mg PO BID until [**3-22**] PM then
increase to 50mg po BID for seven days then increase to 75mg [**Hospital1 **]
ongoing.
-patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in his s/p
arrest neurology clinic
-patient will require intensive PT and OT in an anoxic brain
injury unit.
.
# Respiratory failure: Believed to be due to status asthmaticus,
although inciting event unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 227**] multiple cardiac arrests,
also a concern for development of ARDS.  The patient was
initially treated broadly with vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl,
cipro, and oseltamavir. He was treated with IV soludemedrol and
albuterol MDI. He was ventialted according to ARDS-Net protocol.
On admission, he had two chest tubes placed for pneumothoraces.
They were removed on hospital day 1. In his first several days,
his respiratory status was comprimised by lobar collapse, first
of the RUL and then of the RML. His extubation was initially
limited both by agitation requiring sedation and by requirements
for high PEEP to maintain oxygenation. His oxygenation was
improved with diuresis and agitation was better controlled with
seroquel. He was extubated on [**3-1**] and respiratory status was
stable.  His Asthma was treated with standing and PRN albuterol
and ipratriopium and a slow prednisone taper which he l
completed on [**2115-3-18**] and he was restarted on Advair
-patient may require additional nebs on top of his standing
advair though his respiratory status has been very stable,
without wheezing for the last week.
- would like benefit from outpatient PFTs and is scheduled to
see a pulmonologist in follow up.
.
# Ventilator associated pneumonia:  Patient developed a fever on
[**2-27**] with new infiltrates on chest xray while intubated. He was
initially covered with vanc/cefepime and cipro. Cipro was
eventually discontinued. He did not grow any organisms other
than yeast in his sputum. He completed an 8 day course of
Vanco/Cefepime.
.
# Myoclonus: when mental status improved, was noted to have
myoclonic jerks. per neurology, likely [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1683**] Syndrome
which is anoxic injury to the purkinje cells.  These jerks
continued for about one week and then became rare.
.
# dilated [**Last Name (LF) 89982**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30%. s/p ICD.  Patient was
diuresed with IV lasix in the ED and then transitioned to PO
lasix, home dose, on the floor.  His respiratory status remained
stable. Also continued on home dose of carvedilol and Lisinopril
but ACE downtitrated from 40 to 20 when had elevated Cr 1.9 on
[**3-18**] and slightly low BPs high 90s/60s. BP improved to 100s/60s.

.
#Hypertension: Patient's home regimen was continued on the
floor, but his SBP dipped into the high 80s and low 90s so
lisinopril was decreased to 20mg po daily and his SBP remained
100-130.
.
# L1 compression fracture: After the patient fell, he was
complaining of low back pain so a L-spine Xray was performed and
showed L1 compressin fracture with No cord impingement on
imaging.  The patient had no localizing deficits on serial neuro
exam.  He was treated with pain medication including low dose
ultram, standing tylenol and a lidocaine patch.  Calcitonin was
tried for pain with compression fracture but this did not seem
to help with symptoms so was discontinued.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC >20  persistently in the MICU even after
being treated for infection.  Since no new infection was found
this was presumed [**12-26**] steroids and the leukocytosis improved
with prednisone taper.  WBC 12 on day of discharge
.
# Hyperglycemia: Patient is not known to be a diabetic and was
felt [**12-26**] steroids,  his sugars were controlled on sliding scale
insulin in the hospital but he no longer had insulin
requirements as his prednisone was tapered.
.
#. [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.9 on [**3-18**] from 1.2 which improved to 1.4 on [**3-19**]
with decreasing ACE and 500cc bolus. He should have repeat
creatinine and labs on [**3-22**] to ensure stability.

# Guardianship: Guardianship paperwork was started in the
hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 86 year old female with a history of CAD, CHF, s/p
pacemaker implantation, who presented with a left thigh
hematoma, HCT drop and elevated INR, with acute renal failure.
She was admitted to the CCU on [**2136-7-18**].

#Acute renal failure: The patient had a baseline Cr of 1.4-2.0.
was 1.4 on [**7-15**]. Likely etiology is ATN (muddy-brown casts).
Pt's daughter reporting poor urine output at home. There was no
suspicion of obstructive physiology.  The Patient's fluid status
was initially unclear. She appeared to be dry and was given
fluid however she did not make urine appropriate to the fluid
bolus.  She became fluid overloaded and diuresis was attempted.
She did not respond well to Lasix and continued to retain fluid.
 Nephrology was consulted and recommended holding Lasix and that
the only remaining treatment options for her was dialysis.
Lasix drip was attempted for fluid removal as family did not
want to put patient on dialysis.  The patient's creatinine
continued to rise and was 4.1 on [**7-29**].
.
# CAD: Pt with a h/o MI, s/p stenting [**2128**] to LAD. Originally
report was that pt had a Troponin of 30 at [**Year (4 digits) 16962**]. However, trop T
on admission was 1.40. Elevated enzymes could have been due to a
cardiac event but it was felt that the patient was a poor
candidate for any intervention.  ECG was unchanged and the
patient was without cardiac symptoms. Cardiac enzymes trended
down over admission.
.
# CHF: The patient had a history of Systolic HF. Last echo with
EF 15-20%. The pati net initially received fluid boluses to help
determine etiology of renal failure, however she was unable to
remove volume and not candidate for dialysis.  Patient comfort
made main goal of therapy.
.
# A-FIB: The patient had a history of afib and was s/p pacemaker
placement.She was vpaced (VVI) at the time of admission. Her
Pacer rate increased to attempt to help cardiac output however
this did not have an effect on urine output.
.
# Anemia: The patient had a history of anemia. Baseline HCT
34-38 but was noted to be 22 on admission. Likely etiology is
from suspected bleed-in the area of the L.thigh, likely
spontaneous in the setting of supratherapeutic INR. CT
abd/pelvis/L.thigh ruled out RP and rectus sheath bleed, thigh
hematoma seen. The patient was not transfused blood as
hematocrit stabilized and patient already in heart failure.
.
#history of C.diff- The patient was initially continued on her
suppressive vancomycin therapy, but was stopped with negative
C.diff toxins.
.
# Pain/Palliation/End of life: A family meeting was held on [**7-29**]
and the options/goals of care were discussed.  It was felt that
the patient's renal failure required dialysis and the family was
clear that this was not a therapy they wished to pursue.  It was
agreed that patient would stop medications that were only
present because of long term benefit and that patient comfort
would be the goal of care.  Patient moving towards CMO, no oral
medications and the patient was started on Dilaudid for pain
control.  She was continued on telemetry for family comfort.
Over the next 3 days, the patient's mental status declined and
she became less responsive.  On [**8-1**], the patient was surrounded
by her daughters and care givers when she was noted to become
asystolic. No intervention was attempted.  The patient appeared
to die peacefully and without pain.  She was pronounced dead at
4:24pm.

History of Present Illness:
(History mostly obtained from ED and patient nodding or shaking
head as CPAP mask makes talking difficult). This is a 76 year
old man with multiple medical problems including chronic
systolic CHF, interstitial lung disease, COPD (baseline 2L NC at
night), CKD, and PVD presenting with sudden onset of SOB 7am
this morning and bloody, frothy sputum. Patient reports feeling
well yesterday and rather acute development of this this AM. He
denies any fevers or chills prior to arriving in the ED. He
denies any other localizing symptoms of infection likey dysuria,
diarrhea, or abdominal pain. He [**First Name3 (LF) 653**] EMS for his dyspnea
and was put on 100% NRB oxygen and brought to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.4 (102 rectal), P 80, BP
165/71, RR 34, O2 96% on NRB. He was started on CPAP with
improvement in his O2 sats and in his work of breathing. Given
his relatively high blood pressures and concern of some element
of flash pulmonary edema, he was started on a NTG drip, but then
developed hypotension with SBP's in the 70's to 80's, which
failed to improve with discontinuation of the NTG. Therefore, he
was started on peripheral dopamine before having a femoral line
placed at which point he was transitioned to norepinephrine for
presumed pneumosepsis and hypotension (lactate was 3.8). CXR
showed bilateral multifocal infiltrates so he received
ceftriaxone/vancomycin/azithromycin empirically. Vitals prior to
transfer were P 68, BP 90/34 (up from 70's off pressors), RR 22,
100% on 5 of CPAP.

In the MICU, the patient reported feeling better and was able to
nod or shake his head to answer questions. Still using accessory
muscles to breathe. He was asking for CPAP to be removed.

ROS:(limited due to needing to communicate w/ guestures)

Imaging:
CXR: [**5-19**]
A left-sided pacer demonstrates leads in the right atrium, right
ventricle and coronary sinus. The heart size is enlarged.
Mediastinal contours are somewhat obscured by bilateral fluffy
appearing opacities.  Calcified atherosclerotic disease is noted
in the aortic knob. Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen.
No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema,
increased compared with prior study.

CXR: [**5-19**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
intubated. The tip of the tube projects 4.8 cm above the carina.
Nasogastric tube in situ, the tip of the tube projects over the
middle parts of the stomach. Unchanged course and position of
the pacemaker leads. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities show
minimal regression at the level of the bases of the lungs; in
the more apical lung regions, however, the severity of
the opacities is unchanged. Increasing retrocardiac atelectasis.
The presence of bilateral small pleural effusions cannot be
excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax.

CXR: [**5-22**]
Since prior examination, mild improvement in still severe
airspace opacity involving the right upper lobe, though with
worsening of severe opacity in the left retrocardiac region that
is likely component of effusion and/or atelectasis. Othwise
stable diffuse multifocal opacification. Stable moderate
bilateral pleural effusions. Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity
of the thoracic aorta. Persistent mild pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
engorgement.
IMPRESSION: Grossly stable combination of multifocal pneumonia
and pulmonary edema. Increased severe left basal atelectasis.

CXR: [**5-31**]
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Left transvenous pacemaker
leads terminate
in the standard position in the right atrium, right ventricle
and through the coronary sinus. There is no evident
pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Bilateral diffuse opacities that were a combination of pulmonary
edema and pneumonia have markedly improved. Still there are some
opacities in the perihilar regions, right apex, and right lower
lobe



Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old male with multiple medical problems including CHF,
COPD, and ILD with very poor respiratory reserve presenting with
hypoxemic respiratory failure with fever and hypotension.

1) Pulmonary (Hypoxic Respiratory Failure): Patient was
initially admitted to MICU where intubation was required from
[**2085-5-18**]. Multiple etiologies were considered to explain his
hypoxic respiratory failure. At baseline patient has
interstitial lung disease and COPD. Given fever, leukocytosis,
sputum, elevated lactate multifocal pneumonia was also
considered and ultimately treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Unfortunately, all sputum cultures were contaminated. During
patient's MICU stay he was diuresed with IV lasix gien concern
for a possible element of volume overload as well though BNP,
while elevated, was less than previous values on admission for
CHF exacerbation. PE was considered however thought to be
unlikely given evidence for multiple other processes to explain
respiratory failure. Further, patient was anticoagulated making
PE less likely. With history of COPD steroid taper was started
as well as standing nebs. Patient was eventually weaned to 2L NC
and transferred to the floor. On the floor patient finished the
course of antibiotics for HAP, continued diuresis, and standing
nebs. He continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint
until [**5-31**] whent he patient was found to be somnolent with
decreased respiratory drive and ABG 7.30/71/146/36. Patient was
then transferred to the MICU where mental status cleared and
hypercarbic respiratory failure resolved. This somnolence and
diminished respiratory drive was thought to be secondary to
small increase in the patient's gabapentin dose which he was
taking for post herpetic neuralgias. After patient returned to
the floor he was continued on a small dose of PO lasix per
outpatient regimen, prednisone taper, and standing nebs. Because
the patient was deconditioned and continued to have desats the
mid 80s on 2L while ambulating he was discharged to rehab.
.
2)AMS: On [**5-31**], he was noted to be increasingly altered and
confused, pulling at his oxygen, picking at his clothing and
mumbling nonsense. His ABG at the time was 7.30/71/146/36. His
O2 was removed to see if his respiratory drive was depressed,
but he desatted down to 70% and needed to have the oxygen
replaced. Transferred to the MICU as noted above. This AMS was
in the setting of neurontin dosing for zoster related ear pain.
He was monitored and improved in the ICU with very little
intervention other than holding his neurontin.

3) Presumed Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient had increased
sputum in the context of fever, leukocytosis, and bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates suggesting pneumonia. All sputum cultures
were contaminated and urine legionella was negative. Given
history of MRSA and multifocal infiltrate patient was treated
with Vanc, Cefepime for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.

4) Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive in the context of
receiving nitroglycerin but remained hypotensive once this
medication was stopped. Initially patient required
norepinephrine which was quickly weaned. Given concern for
adrenal insufficiency stress dose steroids were initiated at
50mg IV hydrocortisone Q6hrs. This was weaned to PO
hydrocrotisone twice daily. Eventually, blood pressures
stabilized and anti hypertensive agents were restarted.
.
5) Chronic systolic CHF/ Dilated Cardiomyopathy: During
admission patient was thought to be slightly volume overloaded
despite an elevated BNP that was lower than prior admissions.
During his stay he was diuresed with IV lasix and then converted
to 20mg PO lasix at the time of discharge. Patient was continued
on QOD digoxin and while his beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were initially
held these were restarted prior to discharge.
.
6) Stage IV CKD: On admission Creatinine was not markedly
elevated from baseline. Throughout the hospitalization
creatinine fluctuated between 1.3 - 2 depending on the degree of
diuresis. Nephrotoxins were avoided when possible.
.
7) AF: Patient is pacemaker dependent. Coumadin was continued
while inpatient. During admission INR became supratherapeutic
and Coumadin was held. During this time as noted below patient
developed GI Bleed which reguired reversal of INR and heparin
gtt. At discharge patient will continue coumadin per home
regimen 2.5mg Daily, except Tuesdays when he will take 1.5mg.
.
8) History of DVT: Continued coumadin
.
9) Adrenal Insufficiency: Initially patient was hypotensive so
stress dose steroids were initiated as above. Once blood
pressures stabilized patient was transitioned to home
hydrocortisone regimen.
.
10) Chronic Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia thought to be
related to chronic kidney disease. As an outpatient patient
recieves EPO injections Monthly. During admission patients HCT
trended down in the setting of supratherapeutic INR and GI bleed
as noted below. Patient was transfused two units pRBCs when
HCT<21. HCT will be followed as an outpatient and EPO injections
will be continued.
.
11) Recent Herpes Zoster: Pt received >7 days of therapy for
zoster and no active lesions. No vision changes or eye
involvement. Patient was continued on gabapentin 300mg [**Hospital1 **]. Post
herpetic neuralgias continued to bother patient during the
hospitalization, patient reported [**12-6**] pain, and gabapentin was
increased to 400mg TID. The day following this change the
patient became increasingly somnolent as noted above. Gabapentin
at that time was stopped with improvement in mental status.
Scheduled tylenol was continued for pain. Narcotics and
neurontin were avoided given the somnolence noted above.
.
12) Hyperlipidemia: Continued rosuvastatin
.
13) GI Bleed: On [**5-29**], patient developed dark melenotic stool in
the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. INR was reversed with Vit
K 5 mg PO, GI was consulted, and IV PPI 40mg [**Hospital1 **] was started.
HCT was followed and was relatively stable. GI deferred
endoscopy given the patient's stability and poor respiratory
status given concern the patient would reguire intubation for
the procedure. At discharge patient will continue Omeprazole
40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will arrange for further GI evaluation once
patient is optomized from a respiratory standpoint.
.
14) Non Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia: Throughout the
hospitalization patient had NSVT. The longest run of NSVT was 22
beats during which patient was asymptomatic. Patient has BiV ICD
in place. Electrophysiology [**Last Name (STitle) 6349**] pacemaker and it was found
to be functioning normally. EP noted that the patient's
pacemaker will pace patient out of this concerning rhythm if
rate exceeds 140 bpm. Metoprolol was uptitrated to 25mg Daily
with the hopes of decreasing the frequency of this rhythm.

The pt was admitted to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 487**] [**Hospital3 91711**] ICU and was given IVF,
Zozyn, and Vanc. Neurology c/s noted that hyperglycemic
acidosis, metabolic derangements, & mult psych meds could have
precipitated seizure/obtundation. Also, couldn't r/o stroke.
Started on phenytoin, asa, EEG unhelpful, MRI when stable.
Patient started to improve and was extubated but never recovered
basline mental status. CXR's no acute process/infiltrate. Renal
fxn improved, Cr 3.2 from 4, CK down from 58,000 to 31,000.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 M h/o Hep C, HTN, depression on mult psych meds p/w altered
mental status/obtunded, rhabdo, fevers, and increased stiffness
after found down at home, transferred to us from [**Hospital1 487**] for
worsened fever, rigidity, CK. Had indications of rhabdo. His
mental status waxed and waned. Most likely was [**1-23**] NMS. Was
having continuous fevers and worsened obtundation. After gradual
improvement in mental status, he was transferred to the floor.
.
# Altered MS: Initially on admission he had an LP which showed
alot of RBC's. Differential was aseptic vs. blood tap vs.
subarachnoid blood from encephalitis / necrosis. He was placed
on CTX, Vanc, Amp, and acyclovir ([**9-14**]) and started cooling.
Neuro was following while he was in the ICU who believed this is
most likely due to NMS which might take about 14 days to
improve. He was treated with bromocriptine. EEE, West Nile
virus, lyme serology were sent. Lyme and RPR negative. MRI brain
showed mild to moderate cortical atrophy. His Parasite smear and
OSH cultures were negative. PICC line placed [**9-15**]. CSF HSV PCR
was negative and acyclovir subsequently was discontinued ([**9-18**])
along with the other antibiotics ([**9-17**]) given the low suspicion
of bacterial cause. EEG initially showed high epileptiform
activity and valium was started. Subsequent EEG monitoring
showed no seizure activity with gradual taper of valium and
discontinuation on [**9-18**]. On [**9-19**] he was more obtunded with
increased oxygen requirement. Therefore, CT and MRI head were
done which showed no acute changes. Vanc anc cefepime were
started on the same day to cover for presumed HAP given
increased oxygen requirement. CXR didn't show new infiltrates.
Abx dc'ed [**9-25**]. IV acyclovir was restarted [**9-20**] but dc'ed
Lactulose was initiated given concern of hepatic encephalopathy
in setting of HCV and elevated liver enzymes. RUQ ultrasound
showed cirrhosis with trace ascites. His mental status improved.
He received tube feeds starting from [**9-15**] and discontinued after
NG tube was self-removed by him on [**9-26**]. satting 92-93% on RA
while attempting to place an NG tube which eventually failed and
not pursued further. Tolerating apple sauce.
His mental status continued to improve.  Recommendation by
Neurology is to continue  bromocriptine  until [**2193-10-5**] and
continue Keppra for now.
Pt was started on Lactulose and should continue on this
titrating to 3BMs per day to avoid any component of hepatic
encephalopathy.
.
# Hypoxia
Continued oxygen requirement during his stay, but was satting in
90's on RA even during NG tube insertion multiple attempts on
his transfer day. stable. Cultures were have been unremarkable.
Large amounts of mucus were removed [**9-19**] with poor gag reflex.
Suspect due to secretions and AMS with poor cough.  He was
treated empirically for PNA.
This improved with improvement in mental status and has been off
oxygen prior to discharge.
.
# Transaminitis:
Persistently elevated AST and ALT. Evidence of cirrhosis on RUQ
US and CT. History of HepC. Continued laculose empirically for
hepatic encephalopathy.
.
# Hypernatremia
Resolved, likely due to poor access to free water.
.
# ARF/rhabdo: Initially Cr 3.0 on admission, ARF due to
rhabdomyolysis, CPK [**Numeric Identifier 24869**].  He received aggressive IVF hydration
with improvement in CPK and normalization of Cr to 0.7.
.
# HTN: Controlled on Labetalol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **];
.
# DM on insulin:
-on lantus and ISS
.
# Elevated Troponins:
Was not concerning for ACS.  Was in setting of ARF, elevated CK
w rhabdo, tachycardia. EKG sinus, normal int/axis, no st
changes.
.
Rehab Issues:
.
#Speech and Swallow recommendations:
1. PO diet: Thin liquids, pureed solids.
2. 1:1 supervision with POs.
3. One sip of liquid at a time.
4. Pills crushed with applesauce.
5. TID oral care.
6.  Keppra to be cut and given with applesauce.
.
#Psych recommendations:
-Would utilize behavioral means to reduce delirium (ie. maintain
light/dark cycles, frequent redirection).
-Would not initiate psychiatric medications at this time
(antipsychotics or antidepressants). At least two weeks should
be allowed to elapse after recovery from NMS before rechallenge
with a low-potency antipsychotic.
-In case of behavioral agitation, would refrain from use of
antipsychotic and instead utilize benzodiazepines (ie. Ativan)
or mechanical restraints (ie. posey, wrist restraints).
-Pt. should be followed by rehab psychiatrist, with followup
with outpatient treaters arranged.

resection, progressive on multiple chemo regimen, presents to
the ED with 3 days of worsening N/V/D, found to be fevebrile,
hypotensive, hypoxemic. On [**6-8**] c1w2 of taxotere (3wks on 1wk
off). Tolerated well until 3 days ago when he developed
non-bloody diarrhea after he went out to eat at a restaurant. He
called the fellow on call and was given imodium which he [**Last Name (un) **] w/o
significant relief. Today, pt's wife called to inform Heme/Onc
fellow that Mr. [**Known lastname **] is having n/v, and now unable to keep down
PO fluids. He also c/o chills. Pt was referred to ED for further
evaluation. He reports 4 episodes of non-bilious non-bloody
vomiting today. He denies abdominal pain. + chills
.
In the ED, initial VS T 102.1, HR 102; BP 133/52; RR 20; 93% RA.
He then became hypoxic to 88% (baseline 92%) and hypotensive
with systolic BP in upper 80's/low 90's, blood gas concerning
with 7.37/34/63. Lactate 1.2. Labs remarkable for K 5.6, pt was
given kayexalate. WBC 3.9 (46% neutrophils), Hct 35.6 (down from
40.2 in [**4-1**]). U/A negative, BCx and UCx sent. CXR with interval
progression of NSCLC in the right upper and left lower lobes
with larger more dense masses. Otherwise, relatively stable. The
patient was given Cefepime 2 gm IV once, Zofran, Tylenol,
kayexalate, and given total of 5L NS.
.
The patient currently is asymptomatic. Denies any trouble
breathing. Denies LH or dizziness. Reports normal urine output
at home.


Past Medical History:
- NSCLC:  s/p right upper and middle lobectomy ([**11-27**]) and wedge
resection of the left lower lobe([**3-30**]) lung nodule, recurrent
[**2-27**], s/p protocol with Navelbine and Cetuximab, started [**5-30**],
completed 6 cycles by [**10-30**]. Given dz progression started on
tarceva d/c'd in [**12-31**] due to further dz progression.
Subsequently had 2 cycles Alimta, oxaliplatin, and Avastin but
again had dz progression on imaging. ECOG protocol 2501 with
sorafenib started 03/[**2184**].
- Diabetes mellitus type 2
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia


Social History:
He is a retired automotive mechanic and has
taught most recently automotive repair. He is married with one
child. He is a 50-pack-year smoker but quit approximately 35
years ago. He uses alcohol on an irregular basis but has never
drunken to excess.


Family History:
Unremarkable for malignancy but he has a
significant history of cerebrovascular and coronary artery
disease among his relatives.

Pertinent Results:
[**2186-6-14**].  CTA.  IMPRESSION:  No filling defect is identified
within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.
Again seen are multifocal consolidations throughout bilateral
lungs, corresponding to known bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma.
Compared to the prior CT from [**2186-5-15**], there is dramatic
increase in the extent and the  density of the consolidation
which is concerning for significant short-term disease
progression versus superimposed infection.



Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old male with NSCLC who was
admitted for post-obstructive pneumonia and dehydration
secondary to diarrhea from chemotherapy.
.
Post Obstructive PNA.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially treated in the
MICU, but was then transferred to OMED.  He was treated for
pneumonia with Unasyn in the hospital and was sent home on
Augmentin.  He was requiring 5L  NC of oxygen during the
hospitalization, which was thought to be due to lung cancer,
pneumonia and pulmonary edema after geting 5L of fluid in the
MICU.  His oxygen requirments improved with lasix.  By
discharge, he was requiring only 2LNC of oxygen.
.
Diarrhea.  He was initially admitted with diarrhea, thought to
be due to chemotherapy.  He was treated with IVF in the MICU.
His diarrhea resolved without intervention.
.
In addition, he was treated with ISS for type II DM, HCTZ,
Verpamil and Lisinopril for HTN (one hypotension from diarrhea
resolved), and Lovastatin for Hyperlipidemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M with DMII, CKD, HTN, DVT, asthma, presents with
shortness of breath, wheezing, agitation, and confusion.
.
# Dyspnea: Secondary to bronchospasm from reactive airways
disease and pneumonia seen on CXR. He received albuterol
nebulizer treatments and a 3-day burst of steroids (Solu-Medrol
x 1 dose, prednisone 40mg daily x 2 doses) for his bronchospasm,
as well as broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime and
azithromycin) for HCAP. He was switched to levofloxacin upon
transfer to the floor and his symptoms continued to improve.  He
was continued on his home Advair and singulair. Satting 100% on
room air at time of discharge.
.
# Hypotension: He was briefly hypotensive in the ER in setting
of hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  His hypotension was
fluid-responsive, and there were no further episodes of
hypotension in the ICU or on the floor.
.
# h/o DVT: Patient is on coumadin at home and presented with
supratherapeutic INR, 5.6. Coumadin was held throughout
admission and his INR was 2.6 on discharge. He will need close
monitoring of his INR in the context of taking antibiotics.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely pre-renal given low
urine chloride and bland urine sediment.  His creatinine
improved with hydration.
.
# Delirium: Patient was intermittently confused and agitated,
however he was generally redirectable. Likely related to
steroids, infection and starting levofloxacin. Steroids were
stopped after 3-day burst and patient has 2 doses of
levofloxacin remaining. Did not receive any sedating medications
while in-house.
.
# Elevated troponin: His troponins were elevated in the setting
of renal failure with mild CK-MB elevation that was flat.  His
EKGs were reassuring against ACS and the patient denied any
chest pain.
.
# Stage 2 ulcers: On sacrum and scrotum. Managed with frequent
cleaning and dressing changes. No evidence of infection.
.
# DM2: Patient had recent admission for hypoglycemia. Glipizide
was held while in house. His fingersticks were monitored, and he
was on insulin sliding scale while in the hospital. He
intermittently refused insulin, however, his blood glucose was
controlled in the 100s-200s.
.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Systemic anticoagulation (supratherapeutic
INR throughout admission).
.
# Communication: Has temporary guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 77982**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] on [**2112-3-30**] after subtotal colectomy for LGIB requiring a
massive transfusion of 8u pRBC.

His [**Hospital 18**] hospital course is broken down by systems:

Neuro
He was intermittently sedated with fentanyl and propofol.  His
sedation was weaned to prn dilaudid and oxycodone liquid.  Pain
gradually became a nonissue.  He should not require pain
medication even for VAC changes.  He was seen by neurology for
dystonia, who recommended an MRI of the brain whcih showed an
acute left parietal subcortical infarct.  The neurologist felt
that coumadinizing him with a goal INR 2.5- 3.5 would be best to
prevent another stroke.  The etiology of his stoke is presumed
cardiac given his atrial fibrillation.  His cognition gradually
improved throughout his hospital course, as did his dystonia,
for which he is on cogentin per neurology.  At present, he is
alert and can communicate effectovely.

Cards
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 77982**] had afib with RVR for which he was on
an amiodarone gtt.  He was evaluated by cardiology and weaned
off amiodarone.  After amiodarone was weaned, his rhythm was
intermittently in and out of afib.  He eventually stabilized on
PO lopressor and PO amiodarone.  In addition, he was
intermittently on and off pressors, including levophed and
pitressin.  Eventually he stabilized and has been off of all
pressors for over 2 weeks prior to discharge.

Pulm
The patient had a tracheostomy.  He was gradually weaned on the
ventillator.  Eventually he was weaned to trach collar, which he
has been tolerating for over 2 weeks.  On [**5-4**], he did tolerate a
Passy-muir valve trial.  He requires supervision with the PM
valve, because he desaturates.  He does require suctioning
intermittently.

FEN/GI
Tube feeds via Dobhoff, TPN, ostomy, serial abdominal
debridements [**4-4**], [**4-8**], and abdominal VAC [**4-12**], 16, 17, 20, 24,
26 and Q 3 days thereafter.  Last VAC change was [**2112-5-8**].  His
abdominal wound has been healing very well with a VAC dressing.
It is granulating nicely.  There had been a fistulous connection
between the ostomy and the wound.  This has since closed off
after a few vicryl sutures were placed at the bedside.  He was
seen and evaluated by plastic surgery who recommended outpatient
skin grafting.  He has been tolerating tube feeds at goal for
over 2 weeks prior to discharge and his ostomy is productive.
He gets his tube feeds via a Dobhoff.  We did not feel that a
PEG was a good idea in him beacause of his anatomy.  He was
hypernatremic to 153 at a maximum, but he did respond to free
water boluses and his sodium has since stabilized.  We have
since decreased his free water boluses.

GU
He developed ARF and started hemodialysis at the referring
institution x3 days.  Daily CVVH was started at [**Hospital1 18**] via R fem
HD catheter, and he was weaned off CVVH, intermittently on
lasix, and he now makes appropriate urine output without any
assistance.  His azotemia gradually cleared.  Withing the past
week, we have started gradual diuresis to make him about a liter
negative daily.  His weights have been retruning to baseline of
98 kg.

H
Mr. [**Known lastname 77982**] was found to have small peripheral PEs and HIT at
the referring institution, and was continued on an argatroban
gtt.  Eventually he was transitioned off the argatroban to
coumadin.  He was found to be HIT negative by seratonin release
assay.  He is currently on coumadin, goal INR 2.5- 3.5.

ID
The patient had a long and complicated infectious disease
course.
Meropenem ([**4-16**]) and vancomycin ([**4-17**]) for MRSA PNA, fluconazole
for [**Female First Name (un) **] torulopsis in the urine and sputum [**4-19**], flagyl
empircally for C. diff (although he never tested positive) [**4-20**]
Cultures include
Klebsiella in blood at OSH
[**3-31**] Wound cx: [**Female First Name (un) **], klebs
[**4-3**] Sputum: budding yeast, GNR, MRSA
[**4-10**] Sputum: sparse klebs [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cipro/bactrim
[**4-14**] Sputum: MRSA, Klebs
[**4-17**] sputum: MRSA, 2+budding yeast, sparse GNR
[**4-20**] sputum: MRSA and 1+budding yeast

Eventually, all antiobiotics were stopped on [**2112-5-4**].

Endo
Mr. [**Known lastname 77982**] was kept on a strict insulin sliding scale to keep
his sugars within a tight range.

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 101562**] is a 64 year old woman with multiple medical problems
who was referred to our clinic for a pericardial window. She was
being evaluated by ENT (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] this spring for excision
of leukoplakia of the vocal cords when a moderate pericardial
effusion was discovered on pre-operative testing. Her
ENT procedure was postponed pending management of the effusion.
Of note, she is a poor historian and is unsure of her medical
issues or surgical plans. She had a pericardiocentesis performed
six months ago which drained 1L. She denies prior thoracic or
major abdominal surgery. She was recently placed on coumadin for
A-fib, she has held that for 2 days. Last INR available was 2.6

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 101562**] was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service on the
day of her scheduled surgery, [**2115-5-15**]. INR was checked that day
(1.2). She underwent left video assisted thoracoscopic surgery
with pericardial window under Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The surgery was
uneventful and went as planned, but she remained intubated
overnight given her very high oxygen requirement. She was
transferred to the ICU intubated and an urgent pulmonology
consult was requested. Our pulmonology colleagues agreed with us
that she was retaining fluid leading to pulmonary edema so we
removed all IV fluid and began diuresis with furosemide IV. She
responded well and she was extubated in the afternoon of POD 1.
By POD 2, she had resumed most of her home medications and was
beginning a regular diet. Her Coumadin was resumed and
pericardial drain was removed (total output ) on POD 3. She
remained in the ICU until POD 4, the primary indication being
increased oxygen demand, requiring face tent most of the day.
Chest x-rays and daily weights indicated she was no longer fluid
overloaded, but her oxygenation continued to be poor. On the
floor, we were unable to keep her oxygen saturation above 90%
with less than 4L nasal canula. She reports this as her baseline
pulmonary status, though denies being on home oxygen. She was
seen and evaluated by physical therapy who initially recommended
rehab due to risk of fall. She also required 4L NC desaturating
to 84% on 2L NC. Over the next few days she improved.  Physical
therapy re-evaluated her and deemed her safe for home with PT.

While in house some mild confusion which improved over the
course of her hospital stay.  On discharge she was awake, alert,
oriented and walked independently.

Heme: Warfarin was restarted for atrial fibrillation and she
will follow-up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17143**] as an outpatient.

By the time of discharge on [**2115-5-23**], she was tolerating a
regular diet, voiding without difficulty, hemodynamically
stable, taking her home medications and ambulating independently
without oxygen, saturating 94% RA.   She was discharged to home
with [**Location (un) 86**] Care Group VNA and Physical therapy.  She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

CMV Viral Load (Final [**2174-5-6**]): CMV DNA not detected.

ECG [**2174-4-18**]:
Sinus rhythm. Possible left atrial abnormality. Lateral ST-T
wave
abnormality. Cannot rule out myocardial ischemia. Poor R wave
progression.  Cannot rule out anterior wall myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2174-4-2**] multiple described abnormalities persist.

CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast [**2174-4-18**]:
FINDINGS: There is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion,
smaller in
size compared to last CT torso. There is a small pericardial
effusion. Study is suboptimal for evaluation of solid organs due
to lack of IV contrast. With this limitation in mind, there is
no extra- or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. Previously
described presumably focal nodular hyperplasia in segment VI of
the liver is not clearly visualized on a non-contrast CT. There
is a presumably gallbladder wall edema from third spacing with
moderate amount of ascites. There is likely gallbladder sludge.
Pancreas and bilateral adrenal glands are within normal limits
considering the limitation of no contrast administration. There
is interval increase in size of a fat-containing umbilical
hernia measuring 2 cm in transverse dimension with mild fat
stranding(2:50), correlate with point tenderness/physical exam.
The appendix is not dilated (2:49), contains air and there is a
likely small appendicolith (2:53). There is no bowel
obstruction. There is no evidence of colonic wall thickening,
although evaluation is suboptimal given lack of IV or PO
contrast and adjacent ascites.. The kidneys are normal in size.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. Due to lack of oral
contrast, evaluation for mesenteric lymph nodes is suboptimal.
There are scattered lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, however,
do not meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.

CT PELVIS: There is free fluid in the pelvis - ascites. The
uterus and urinary bladder appear normal. The rectum and sigmoid
have scattered diverticula; however, no evidence of
diverticulitis.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.
There is soft tissue stranding suggesting anasarca.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion; however, interval
decrease in size compared to prior.
2. Moderate ascites with interval increase.
3. No drainable fluid collection, however, evaluation is
suboptimal due to lack of IV and oral contrast.
4. Diverticulosis.
5. Interval increase in size of a small fat-containing umbilical
hernia with mild fat stranding, correlate with point tenderness.

6. No bowel obstruction. No definite bowel wall thickening,
although the examination is suboptimal for such.
7. Pericardial effusion, similar to prior.

RUQ ultrasound [**2174-4-18**]:
FINDINGS: The liver is of normal echogenicity. Previously
described presumably focal nodular hyperplasia in segment VI of
the liver is not clearly visualized. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The common bile duct
measures 2 mm. There is ascites. There is gallbladder wall
edema/thickening presumably from third spacing; the gallbadder
is not distended. No convincing evidence of sludge on
ultrasound. The main portal vein is patent. Pancreas is
suboptimally evaluated due to overlapping bowel gas. There is a
small-to-moderate right pleural effusion as seen on recent CT.

IMPRESSION:
1. Ascites.
2. Gallbladder wall edema presumably from third spacing.
3. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
4. No biliary duct dilatation.
5. Previously described presummed focal nodular hyperplasia in
segment VI of the liver is not clearly visualized.

Small bowel follow through [**2174-4-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small, anterior cervical web that does not hinder the passage
of a 13mm
barium tablet.
2. Filling defect in the mid esophagus just below the carina
appears to be either extrinsic compression versus a submucosal
lesion. In correlation with the comparison CT torso, mediastinal
lesion is less likely. Submucosal esophageal lesion remains
within the differential, and direct visualization with EGD is
recommended. Other possibility includes an aberrant vessel in
this vicinity.
3. Mobile cecum which does not appear to be obstructive in any
manner on today's examination.

Renal ultrasound [**2174-4-20**]:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm. The left kidney
measures 9.7
cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone or mass
bilaterally. The
bladder is unremarkable. Moderate amount of ascites is
incidentally noted.

IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis, stone or mass within the kidneys.


Peritoneal Fluid [**2174-4-25**]:
  ATYPICAL.
  Scattered atypical lymphoid cells in a background of
  reactive mesothelial cells

IR guided paracentesis [**2174-4-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
Ultrasound-guided diagnostic paracentesis, with a total of 200
mL of ascites removed.

TTE [**2174-5-2**]:
The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). Systolic function of
apical segments is relatively preserved. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
is mildly increased with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is a small
circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Severe biventricular global hypokinesis. Severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of
tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-4-1**],
the findings are similar.

TTE [**2174-5-10**]:
The left atrium is dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest consistent with a stretched
patent foramen ovale (or small atrial septal defect). There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal with mildly impaired global
left ventricular systolic function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-6**],
ther pericardial effusion is now smaller. Biventricular
sysotolic function appears slightly less vigorous compared to
the prior study (on a lower dose of milrinone now than during
the prior study).

Cardiac cath [**2174-5-5**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Hemodynamics measurements in this patient demonstrate low
cardiac output. Following administration of milrinone, cardiac
index increased to the low-normal range with 2.5 L/min/m2.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrial v-waves
consistent with severe TR noted. Pulmonary vascular resistance
is elevated at 280 dyne-cm-sec5.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary hypertension

LE ultrasound [**2174-5-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis in either lower
extremity.
2. 3.6 cm [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst in the right popliteal fossa as previous.
Superficial soft tissue edema in the right mid thigh, may be
related to partial rupture of [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.

TTE [**2174-5-16**]:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of
tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-10**],
biventricular systolic function is slightly worse. The size of
the pericardial effusion is slightly smaller.

Brief Hospital Course:
38 yo F w/ h/o ALL in remission s/p cord transplant in [**1-13**],
anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20% [**1-14**]) and
recurrent nausea and vomiting who presents with 1 week abd pain,
acute on chronic renal failure and new hyperbilirubinemia.
Unclear unifying diagnosis.

# Acute on Chronic Abdominal Pain:  Pt noted to have significant
abdominal pain as well as increased [**Month/Year (2) 4394**] on admission.  Of
note, she had an extensive work up of her chronic abdominal pain
in the past with no clear cause.  Abdominal CT was unrevealing
for any obvious source of her pain. GI was consulted who
recommended a SBFT which did not reveal any significant
pathology.  GI recommended bentyl for antispasmodic effect.  She
was also continued on her home MS contin and IV morphine for
breakthrough.  Her pain persisted as did her [**Last Name (LF) 4394**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the
decision was made to perform a diagnositc paracentesis under
ultrasound guidance.  200ml peritoneal fluid was removed.  This
revealed 775 WBCs, but a lymphocytic/monocytic predominance with
only 1% polys making SBP unlikely.  Fluid was sent for culture
which showed no growth and flow cytometry which showed no
evidence of ALL recurrence.  Despite lack of evidence for SBP,
she was started on zosyn empirically which was stopped on [**5-2**].
She continued to have mild-moderate abdominal pain but was able
to eat full meals and had BMs. She was continued on her home
mscontin and morphine IR.
.
# Anthracycline-induced/ GVHD cardiomyopathy:  EF <20% on echo
from 2/[**2174**].  Pt was maintained on diuresis as above, which was
subsequently held in the setting of rising creatinine with
improvement in creatinine. Torsemide was slowly reintroduced and
uptitrated to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] which caused another bump in creatinine
to 3.0, so renal and cardiology were consulted. Renal ultrasound
was unrevealing.  She was then taken to the Cath lab and placed
on a milrinone/lasix gtt and transfered to the CCU. Her volume
overload slowly improved and her peripheral edema/ascites slowly
improved as well. A repeat echo showed improved EF to 40-45% on
the milrinone gtt. She was then started on solumedrol 30mg IV
due to a concern for GVHD directed towards myocardium.  After
further discussion between cardiology and her oncology team she
was also started on cellcept for further management of her GVHD.
 She did well on milrinone and lasix drip, but the drip was
stopped when her creatinine bumped to 3.0 and it was felt her
volume status was near maximization.  Her milrinone was then
discontiued and she was then transferred back to [**Hospital1 3242**] for further
management of her abdominal pain and GVHD.  She was continued on
torsemide for diuresis with close follow-up with her outpatient
cardiologist.  Of note, she had frequent alarms on telemetry for
tachycardia that cardiologist felt was mostly due to artifact;
her beta blocker was uptitrated.  Repeat TTE prior to discharge
showed an EF of 35-40%.  She was discharged home on cellcept and
prednisone for possible GVHD.

# Acute Renal Failure:  On admission Cr was 2.7 (recent baseline
was 2), but at last discharge Cr was 2.3.  Renal saw the patient
who thought this was likely from overdiuresis (home torsemide
regimen of 20mg [**Hospital1 **]) in conjunction with her [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] recommended
holding diuresis. Her Cr subsequently improved, but in the
setting of her worsening [**First Name3 (LF) 4394**] and her cardiomyopathy,
decision was made to slowly add back diuresis, and eventually
she was up titrated to toresemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and her [**Last Name (un) **] was
restarted.  With this, however, her Cr began to climb again to
3.0.  Given the delicate balance between her renal failure
cardiomyopathy, cardiology/renal were consulted. Given her
depressed EF, her rising Cr was thought to be [**3-9**] volume
overload. She was sent to the cath lab and started on a
milrinone/lasix gtt and transfered to the CCU with a goal
diuresis of 1L per day. She was actively diuresed on her
milrinone and lasix drip with a total net negative of close to
9L.  Her Cr then returned to baseline by time of discharge and
she was discharged home on torsemide.

# Hyperbilirubinemia:  Unclear cause, could have been related to
a viral infection but no transaminitis to support this.  RUQ u/s
without cause for pain. This trended down to normal values and
remained stable by time of discharge

# Leukocytosis: patient had uptrending WBC in setting of
starting solumedrol, clutures were sent which revealed no
growth.
.
# H/O Embolic Stroke:  Has new opening of PFO based on most
recent echo which likely contributed to her recent stroke.  She
was maintained on coumadin 4mg daily, but anticoagulation was
held on day of paracentesis and remained subtherapeutic for
several days, so she was maintained on a heparin drip to bridge
her to a therapeutic INR [**3-10**]. She was maintained on a decreased
dose of coumadin throughout hospital admission with INR within
goal between 2 and 3. She was arranged with follow-up at
outpatient [**Hospital3 **].

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain.  Your pain
was treated with pain medications, and a new medication called
Bentyl.  You were also switched to a longer acting form of your
morphine.  We did a test to look at your small bowel which was
negative.  At this point we are not sure what is causing your
pain, but you had increased swelling of your abdomen which
likely contributed to your pain.

You underwent a right heart catheterization and [**Known lastname 461**]
to assess your heart function because worsening heart failure
can cause fluid in your belly and worsening kidney disease.  You
were at the cardiac intensive care unit and placed on a
medication that improved your heart function.  A repeat
[**Known lastname 461**] prior to your discharge showed that your heart
function has improved somewhat and is stable.  You will follow
up closely with your cardiologist as several of your heart
medications have changed.  You were started on steroids and
mycophenolate mofetil because it was felt that you heart
problems may be due to your leukemia.

You also had some worsening of your renal failure.  You were
followed by our kidney consult team while you were in the
hospital.  Your kidney function was stable prior to discharge.

We made the following changes to your medications:
-Mycophenolate Mofetil 1000mg twice a day was started
-Prednisone 60mg daily was started
-Coumadin was decreased to 2mg daily
-Torsemide was increased to 40mg daily
-Please hold your valsartan until you see your cardiologist
-Metoprolol succinate 100mg daily was started; please stop
carvedilol
-Bentyl (dicyclomine) was started for your abdominal pain
-Simethicone was started for abdominal discomfort/gas

HISTORY: Epiglottitis with intubation, to assess for acute
abnormality.

FINDINGS:

In comparison with the study of [**10-2**], the endotracheal and
nasogastric tubes
have been removed. The atelectatic streak in the left mid zone
has cleared.

At the current time, there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or
vascular
congestion or pleural effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 44 year old woman with schizoaffective
disorder and SAH s/p coiling L MCA aneurysm transferred from OSH
with with epiglottitis and resp distress now intubated.
.
#. Epiglottitis/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient
initially presented to OSH with sore throat and was found to
have imaging (Neck X ray and CT per report) consistent with
epiglottitis. ABG also consistent with hypercarbia and
respiratory acidosis with concomitant metabolic alkalosis. She
left OSH ED and subsequently presented with stridor and was
intubated for airway protection. Epiglottitis can be caused by
thermal or inhalational injury but is more commonly caused by
infection. The most common bacterial causes include H flu, strep
pneumo, beta hemolytic strep and staph aureus but viral causes
are also possible.  Patient was intially treated with decadron
and empiric ceftriaxne. She was on insulin ss while on steroids.
Rapid resp viral panel sent, antigen was negative, viral
cultures pending at the time of discharge; blood cx sent and
were no growth. Patient was evaluated by ENT with laryngoscopy
while intubated and again after extubation. Initial impression
was that epiglottis was mildly inflamed.  After she was
extubated, she had another endoscopic exam and was noted to have
some vocal cord dysfunction, improved with relaxation techniques
and no obvious epiglottitis. Patient was transferred to the
floor on [**10-3**] and continued to do well. Still had a sore throat,
but no wheezing or shortness of breath, no dysphagia. ENT also
recommended increasing omprazole to 40 mg daily. Have scheduled
outpt ENT follow-up
.
# PEA cardiac arrest- this occured while in ICU, patients pulse
returned after 1 minute or so of chest compressions. Etiology
was felt to be possibly secondary to biting the tube versus
related to propofol. Patient had some pleuritic chest pain
related to chest compressions later in hospital course, treated
with ibuprofen, tylenol and one dose oxycodone. patient has
oxycodone at home still for headaches and continue to take these
as needed for chest pain as well.

#. Anemia: HCT at current baseline 30-32 with high normal MCV.
.
#. h/o SAH and MCA aneurysm s/p coiling [**2130-7-2**] and repeat
coiling [**2130-9-1**]: Neurosurgery aware. No current active
issues
- continue aspirin 325mg PO daily , has f/u scheduled with
Neurosurgery.
.
#. Asthma: Continue albuterol prn (MDI while intubated) although
no current wheezing on exam
.
#. Schizoaffective disorder:
- continued home seroquel
- restarted home benzos, trazodone and gabapentin
.
#. h/o Polysubstance abuse: had urine tox positive for benzos
(gets these rx), amphetamines (on adderal) and barbiturates (on
butalbital for migraines). Denied current substance use.

#. ADHD: Held adderal in icu, restarted prior to discharge.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Vocal cord dysfunction
Epiglottitis
Cardiac arrest


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with wheezing and difficulty breathing and
required intubation. You also had a cardiac arrest which lasted
a short period with return of your heart beat with cpr/chest
compressions. The likely cause of the wheezing was vocal cord
dysfunction, although a viral illness and or gastric reflux may
have been contributing. There was initially concern about
epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis), but this only
mildly inflamed when they looked with a camera in your throat.
You will need to take a higher dose of omeprazole (40mg) and
will need to follow-up with ENT and pcp as scheduled. You should
continue your other outpatient medications as you did previously

increasingly frequent seizures complicated by a recent h/o
cough, dyspnea, bradycardia, and hypothermia.

In [**1-/2196**], developed a cough and drowsiness unaccompanied by
fevers, chills, or SOB, recieved Azithromycin and initially
improved. However, sometime after, his caretaker noticed he was
more drowsy, was drooling, had ""congested"" breathing sounds, and
the seizures were more frequent than the baseline [**3-17**]/month with
occasional myoclonic jerks. Apart from a transient diarrhea
which resolved after empiric Azithro, she reports that there are
no changes in his urine or stool.

EMS was called for dyspnea and on the way to the [**Hospital1 18**], he had

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 26010**] is a 51 year old man with a history of mental
retardation, cerebral palsy and epilepsy who presented with
likely sepsis with hypothermia, bradycardia and increased
seizure frequency.

NEURO:
The patient had a dilantin level of 28 and Carbamazepin level of
3. His increased seizure frequency was felt to be realted to
toxic dilantin levels and infection.  Over the course of this
hospitalization, his medications where redosed multiple times
and it was unclear what his home medications had been as there
where discrepencies in his record.  He was monitored on LTM
while in the ICU and until his medications where stable and
seizure frequency decreased.  His last seizure was on [**4-18**].
Since that time he came of off LTM and continued to do well with
no further seizures.  He was started on a low dose lamicatal to
be titrated slowly up as an outpatient.  From a neurological
standpoint his seiuzures have returned to baseline and he is
ready for discharge.

[**Known firstname **] was evaluated by physical therapy and felt to benefit
from rehabilitation.

ID:
There was initially no souce of infection identified on
admission.  Blood cultures grew Coagulase negative staph in [**4-17**]
bottles.  TTE was without evidence of no clear vegitations.
Although the blood cultures where felt to be a contaminant.  He
was treated with a course of vancomycin emperically after
discussion with ID.  All subsequent cultures after [**3-8**] where
negative.

PULM:
The patient was noted to have episodes of apnea while sleeping.
He may warrent evaluation for sleep apnea.

Social:
The patient was ready for discharge but had an extended hospital
stay secondary as he needed to go to rehab however the proper
guardianship was not in place.  This needed to be established by
court order.  Once this was done he was discharged to rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted following an episode of hypothermia, suspected
sepsis, and increased seizure frequency.  You were observed in
the medical ICU for 6 days, with multiple rounds of viral and
bacterial cultures.  No causative organism was ever found.  You
were treated with broadspectrum antibiotics throughout this
period. You had blood cultures positive for coag negative strep,
which is most consistent with contamination and not a true
positive finding.  Regardless, you received sufficient
vancomycin to cover this organism in the unlikely event that it
represented a true infection.

During this period of suspected sepsis your seizure frequency
was noted to be higher than baseline.  We have adjusted your
anti-seizure medications during the hospitalization.  You have
been very stable and your last seziures was [**2196-4-18**].  You are
currently stable on the medications as follows:

Carbamazepine 400mg/600mg am/pm
Keppra 1500mg/2000mg am/pm
Phenytoin 150mg/100mg am/pm

and you were started on Lamictal 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
which will be increased by 25mg every week until you
are on a dose of 150mg [**Hospital1 **]

Please make all follow up appointments.  If you have an increase
in seizure frequency please ensure the patient's doctor is
notified.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall with hematoma to right side of head

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87 year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent left caudate lobe
infarct who presents after unwitnessed fall and an INR of 20.
Pt sustained two falls today while at home with PT/OT/VNA.
First fall was witnessed with no head trauma or LOC.  Second
fall was unwitnessed and caused hematoma to right side of head.
Pt does not recall falling or events immediately preceding fall
(she was using her cane). She denies dizziness, lightheadedness
or aura prior to event. No chest pain, palpitations. She was
able to put the hand to prevent hitting her head. She did not
feel very fatigued afterward, there were no abnormal movements.
She has rugs at home, but does not remember tripping.  After
falling, pt's next memory is of daughter taking her to her
primary care doctor, where she was found ot have an elevated INR
and administered 10 mg of PO Vitamin K. Pt denies any changes to
her medications including new antibiotics, changes in Coumadin
dosage, diet, or supplements. She denies any current alcohol or
social event.  She denies any fever, chills, diarrhea, nausea,
vomit or other signs of infection. She takes her medications by
herself and knows her Coumadin dose (2.5), but is unable to
mention other medications. She lives in an [**Hospital3 **],
where they do not supervise her in terms of her medications, but
has a VNA. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further care.

In the ER her initial VS: BP 131/53, HR 83, RR 18, 97.7. On
physical exam she was A&OX3, had a hematoma in the right occiput
and lower lip laceration of 0.5 cm. She had C-collar and had
gross blood in the rectal vault. She had labs that were
significant for INR of 20.2 with PTT of 71.4, HCT of 37.7 at her
baseline. She underwent CT scan of the head and c-spine without
any abnormality and CT scan of abdomen and pelvis without acute
pathology. Patient was T&C and received 2 units of FFP. Her VS
were stable throughout the ER course. She was admitted to the
ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. GI was not called from the ER.

Pt was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-3-28**] for right
facial and upper lip angioedema, as well as a recent fall.  Pt's
daughter reports she was confused and altered from her baseline
mental status on day prior to admission.  Angiogedema improved
significantly with IV solumedrol and H1,H2 blockers.  A brain
MRI was obtained due to h/o altered mental status in setting of
fall, and was notable for an acute left caudate head infarct.
MRA of the neck demonstrated a 50% stenosis of the left proximal
internal carotid artery and 50% stenosis in both vertebral
arteries in the V2 segment. The TTE on [**2121-3-31**] was negative for
mural thrombus or cardiac source, but etiology of stroke felt
most likely cardioembolic in setting of subtherapeutic INR.  Pt
was discharged in stable condition to rehab.  On [**2121-4-12**], pt
returned to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with transient dizziness, R arm and face
weakness.  Head CT was negative for bleed, and neuro felt most
her presentation was most likely due to recrudescence of prior
caudate infarct in setting of mild dehydration.

Past Medical History:
- Left Caudate Head infarct
- Angioedema: pruritis and periorbital and lip/tongue edema,
previously intubated in MICU ([**12-16**]), etiology thought to be due
to lisinospril, which was subsequenlty discontinued. Recurrence
in [**3-19**] requiring MICU admission, managed with IV steroids and
H1/H2 blockers, no intubation required.
- Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Osteoporosis

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old woman presents after falling down and hitting head,
admitted with GIB and supratherapeutic INR to ICU.  INR was >20
and was reversed with Vitamin K and 2 units of FFP.  Coumadin
held.  HCT was stable so decision was made not to pursue
colonoscopy.  Acute renal failure resolved with IVF.  The
patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for
continued monitoring of HCT and INR.

PROBLEM LIST:
#. Supratherapeutic INR: Unclear exactly why INR went so high.
Nutritional deficiency vs less efficient GI absorption of
Vitamin K vs drug-drug interaction causing decreased metabolism
of Coumadin.  She was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP and on
discharge her INR was 1.6.  After discussion with her primary
care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] decision was made to restart coumadin at a
lower dose of 1.5mg daily and to have VNA check daily INR until
the levels are therapeutic.  After that, she may require INR
checks twice a week until stable.

#. Lower GI Bleed: No active bleeding after reversing
anticoagulation. HCT stable Source most likely either
diverticulosis or hemorrhoids bleeding in the setting of high
INR.  After discussions with her PMD, she was restarted on
coumadin at a lower dose at 1.5mg daily

#. Atrial fibrillation: Metoprolol dose reduced because of
bradycardia.  As above, her anticoagulation was held until
discharge.  She will restart coumadin at a lower dose at 1.5mg
daily.  She will need f/u regarding her HR and her BP.

#. Falling down / Gait instability: PT consult to determine
recommended level of home supervision

#. Acute Kidney Injury [**3-11**] GIB resulting in hypovolemia.
Resolved with IVF.

#. Hypertension: On Metoprolol. Held Amlodipine.  Restart if
needed for BP control

#. Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin

#. Angioedema: Continue Fexofenadine, Famotidine, and Prednisone

#. Thyroid nodules incidentally seen on CT scan: F/u with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] thyroid US on previous admission that recommended f/u
imaging in 6 months.

#. CT torso demonstrated breast nodule which should be follow up
with mammography as an outpatient.

#. Nose skin hyperpigmented skin lesion: Outpatient follow up

#. DVT prophylaxis with pneumoboots

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after falling down and hitting your head.  You
were found to have an very elevated INR (>20) which is the
reason you had GI bleeding.  CT scans were performed and you did
not have any head or neck fractures.  Your INR was corrected
with Vitamin K and transfusion of plasma.  Your bleeding stopped
and your blood counts remained stable.

We recommend that you stop taking Coumadin until [**2121-5-13**].  You
should restart Coumadin at a lower dose of 1.5mg daily.  You
should restart this tonight.  You will need to call your primary
care provider's office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79255**] to get follow up
appointmen with your Dr. [**Name (NI) **].

CT scans showed incidental findings of thyroid nodule and breast
nodule.  These issues should be addressed with your primary care
physician.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
1. Restart coumadin 1.5mg daily.  You will need daily INRs drawn
and these will be faxed to your primary care [**Provider Number 34259**]. DECREASE DOSE of Metoprolol to 6.25mg twice a day (The dose
was decreased because your heart rate was too slow)
3. STOP Amlodipine (This was stopped because your high blood
pressure is not currently requiring this medication to be
controlled)

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy ([**2180-9-11**])


History of Present Illness:
31yoF with h/o IVDA, cirrhosis [**1-19**] autoimmune hepatitis c/b
portal HTN w/ ascites, variceal bleed s/p TIPS on [**2180-7-17**], and
hepatic encephalopathy, as well as hyperglycemia [**1-19**] TIPs and
steroids represents with abd pain. Of note, the patient was just
admitted Thurs->Friday for N/V/abd pain. During that admission,
she had a CT scan which showed no cause for her pain.
Gastroenteritis was presumed and she was discharged home after
her symptoms improved with zofran and dilaudid.
.
She reports that after discharge on Friday, she felt well. Then,
this morning ~ 5 AM, abd pain woke her from sleep. The pain was
diffuse, sharp and intermittent. She was able to get back to
sleep after 45 minutes. Then, when her mom woke her to check her
fsbg ~ 10, she again noticed the abd pain. She slept most of the
day, but did have 1 episode of nbnb emesis and felt persistently
nauseated. She also took her temperature during the course of
the day and it trended from 101 to 99.0. Her mother thought she
should go to the hospital because of the pain and vomiting so
she went to Addison-[**Doctor Last Name **].
.
At OSH ED, she received zofran 4 mg, dilaudid 1 mg x 3, and 1L
NS. Her pain improved. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because she
was concerned she needed imaging, which couldn't happen quickly
there. At [**Hospital1 **] ED, initial VS 99.9 82 109/57 14 99% on RA. First
set of labs was inaccurate. 2nd set of labs significant for
baseline pancytopenia, Na 137, Cr 0.6, and INR 2.2 (bl = 1.8)
(though INR was from first draw). LFTs were near baseline. RUQ
U/S showed cirrhotic liver, stable splenomegaly, unchanged
gallbladder wall edema and new to-and-fro flow in the left
portal vein. She was given 2L NS, 0.5 mg IV dilaudid x2, and 4
mg IV zofran. Stool guaiac was negative.
.
Currently, VS 97.4 126/74 87 20 100% on RA. She states that she
feels much better now though still has [**5-26**] diffuse, sharp abd
pain. Her nausea has resolved and she ate 2 box meals in the ED
today. She says that she feels silly to have come to the ED
again with most of the tests being negative and asks if she is
expected to have abd pain/nausea/vomiting with her disease. She
wasn't sure whether or not she should have come to the hospital
and didn't know who to call to ask.

.
Finally, this patient has had a complicated course over the past
3 months. Briefly, she was admitted on [**6-12**] for a GI bleed -
grade 1 varices without bleeding seen on EGD. She represented on
[**7-1**] again with GI bleeding - EGD showed non-bleeding varices,
gastritis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted again on
[**7-12**] for a third GI bleed - this admission she had TIPS
procedure performed. Course was complicated by high-grade MRSA
bacteremia requiring 6 weeks of IV vancomycin (at rehab, d/t
concern of IVDA and PICC line). She was then admitted from rehab
on [**8-8**] for hepatic encephalopathy and again on [**8-25**] for hepatic
encephalopathy and hyperglycemia.

DIAGNOSTICS:
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL [**2180-9-9**]
DUPLEX DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER: The liver demonstrates
heterogeneous
echogenicity, findings consistent with patient's known history
of cirrhosis.
No focal hepatic lesion is identified. The visualized portions
of the
pancreatic head, neck, and body are within normal limits.
Evaluation of the
tail is limited by overlying bowel gas. The spleen remains
enlarged measuring
15.7 cm. There is unchanged diffuse gallbladder wall edema,
findings
consistent with patient's underlying chronic liver disease.
However, no focal
gallstones are visualized. The common bile duct measures 5 mm
and is not
dilated. There is a mild amount of perihepatic and left upper
quadrant
ascites, which is new compared to prior ultrasound though
similar compared to
recent CT examination.

LIVER DOPPLER: Color and pulse wave Doppler examination of the
hepatic
vasculature demonstrates a patent main portal vein with a peak
systolic
velocity of 44 cm/sec compared to 59 cm/sec on recent prior. The
TIPS is in
unchanged position with wall-to-wall flow throughout and typical
respiratory
variations. The velocity in the proximal TIPS ranges from
167-196 cm/sec
compared to 150-190 cm/sec on recent prior. The range of
velocities in the
mid TIPS ranges from 144-164 cm/sec, decreased compared to prior
when it
measured 177-231 cm/sec. The peak systolic velocity in the
distal TIPS
measures 134 cm/sec compared to 121 cm/sec on the prior. The IVC
is patent
with usual directional flow. The left portal vein demonstrates
some to- and
fro- flow which appears new compared to prior examination,
though centrally
flow is in the direction of the TIPS. The main hepatic artery
demonstrates
normal arterial Doppler waveform with a peak systolic velocity
of 85 cm/sec.

IMPRESSION:
1. Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and respiratory
variability. Stable
velocities in the proximal and distal TIPS with slightly
decreased velocities
in the mid TIPS compared to recent prior examination.
2. Newly identified to and fro flow within the left portal vein,
though
centrally flow appears hepatofugal towards the TIPS stent.
3. Stable cirrhotic-appearing liver, diffuse gallbladder wall
edema and
splenomegaly.
4. Small amount of perihepatic and left upper quadrant ascites,
which is new
compared to prior ultrasound though similar compared to recent
CT examination.

given.  She underwent endoscopy on [**2180-9-12**] complicated by a GI
bleed when a previously placed coil in the duodenum became
dislodged. The pt's Hct dropped to 16.9 and she was taken to IR
to embolize the bleeding duodenal varix and subsequently
transferred to the CCU.

Transplant surgery was consulted and on [**2180-9-13**] she was taken to
the OR for exploratory laparotomy, ligation of duodenal varix,
duodenotomy, and retrieval of embolic coils. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was
placed. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to operative
note for details.

Postop course was complicated by high ascites drain output
requiring IV fluid replacements and albumin. Diet was slowly
advanced. Lactulose and Rifaximin were started to prevent
encephalopathy. She had high pain med requirements for
persistent abdominal pain. Drain fluid was sent for cell count
and culture on [**9-22**]. Culture of fluid isolated 2 species of
Acinetobacter Baumanii pan-sensitive except Bactrim. She was
started on Cetriaxone. Fluid was re-sent on [**9-25**] demonstrating
94 WBC and 21 polys. Culture was negative.

On postop day 13, she was re-started on Lasix and Aldactone. On
postop day 14, the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was removed. Incision and old
drain site remained dry. However, abdominal girth increased.
Creatinine started to rise.

On [**9-29**], a liver donor offer was available. Patient accepted
and underwent Liver Transplant. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Please refer to operative note for details. She was sent to SICU
immediately postop for management where she was extubated. LFTs
increased as anticipated. Liver US/Duplex demonstrated patent
arteries with resistive index in the right hepatic artery  0.7
to 0.78,  main hepatic artery was 0.78 to 0.79, and left hepatic
artery was 0.68. The middle, right, and left hepatic veins were
patent with normal waveforms. The main, right anterior, right
posterior and left portal veins are patent with normal
waveforms. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation was seen. Repeat liver duplex was unchanged. LFTs
trended down.

Creatinine continued to rise to 3.2 then decrease. Lasix was
given for generalized edema.

Diet was advanced and tolerated. Insulin gtt was initially
started then switched to sliding scale. She remained
hemodynamically stable and was transferred out of the SICU.

LFTs decreased. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and Lantus with sliding
scale ordered.  She was assisted out of bed to ambulate. Pain
medication was switched to po Dilaudid. Dose was increased for
c/o abdominal pain. Lateral JP was removed on [**10-3**] and site
sutured. This remained dry. On [**10-9**], a liver biopsy was
performed for rising alk phos. Biopsy demonstrated bile duct
proliferation. An ERCP was then done on [**10-11**] noting CBD
stricture; duct was stented. Alk phos decreased after stenting.
She tolerated the procedure fairly well. She complained of
abdominal pain and severe headache. She was also hypertensive.
This was treated with IV Lopressor and IV Morphine. Head CT was
normal. Norvasc was stopped for potential etiology of headache.
Headache and abdominal pain resolved.

Immunosuppression consisted of Cellcept which was well
tolerated, steroids were tapered per protocol. Prograf was
initiated and doses adjusted. The plan was for Prednisone to
continue permanently after taper for Autoimmune hepatitis. Lasix
was continued for 2+ leg edema. Creatinine normalized.

She was cleared by PT for home safety and was discharged to her
mother's home with VNA services. She demonstrated good knowledge
of medications and insulin management.

Of note, she experienced developed diffuse itching and burning
of the skin
and sensation of shortness of breath after eating a peanut
butter [**Location (un) 6002**].  She was given Benadryl for this and was
evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2602**] Sheik, who felt that she could have
acquired  passive transfer of food specific IgE antibodies with
a organ transplant. She was instructed to avoid all peanut
products strictly for the next month and/or until seen in
[**Hospital 9039**] Clinic in followup. Serum specific IgE to peanuts and
other common food allergens were sent, and she was given an
EpiPen script on discharge.  Administration technique was
provided. She will followup in the outpatient [**Hospital 9039**] Clinic n
two to four weeks.  Results of blood tests were to be reviewed
at that time.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercalcemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 47 year old woman who carries a diagnosis of
HTLV-associated adult T-Cell leukemia/lymphoma who presents from
routine clinic appointment with hypercalcemia, with a corrected
calcium of 15.5. She received a liter of normal saline, but no
bisphosphonate, and was subsequently admitted to the floor.
.
She was recently hospitalized from [**2103-7-11**] through [**2103-8-4**], also
for hypercalcemia with acute mental status changes, which was
attributed to progression of her hematologic malignancy.
Following IV hydration and zometa, her calcium normalized, and
she underwent treatment with [**Hospital1 **] cycle 1. Her post-chemo
course was unfortunately complicated by DIC requiring multiple
cryoprecipitate, C. dif colitis, CMV viremia, and a severe
abdominal pain requiring bowel rest with TPN. She developed a
LLL pnuemonia towards the end of her hospitalization and was
discharged on a 10 day course of levaquin in addition to home
TPN.
.
Since her discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] has been slowly regaining her
strength, noting persistent fatigue which has acutely worsened
today. She denies acute confusion or mental status changes which
accompanied her previous hypercalcemic episode. She notes no
pain or paresthesias or tetany. Her last hospitalization was
complicated by severe abdominal pain requiring bowel rest- she
remains on home TPN and has been tolerating light meals due to a
sense of fullness. She also had CXR evidence of LLL pneumonia
and had been discharged on levaquin, which she has taken. She
had also developed C.dif, and CMV viremia, which had been
maintained on PO flagyl x 14d and valganciclovir in the
outpatient setting.
.
On review of systems, the patient denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, rigors, abdominal pain, blood in
the stools, shortness of breath, cough, dysuria, hematuria,
paresthesias, weakness.


Past Medical History:
Stage [**Doctor First Name **] mycosis fungoides (Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, stage IV
1A) with transformation to CD-30 positive large cell lymphoma
and development of HTLV-1 Adult T-cell Leukemia Lymphoma
.
- [**10-29**]: The patient developed a pruritic, papular rash. She
was seen in the internal medicine and dermatology clinics on
several occasions and was treated with antibiotics,
triamcinolone, clobetasol, and IV triamcinolone w/ no
improvement.
- [**2100-3-12**]: Skin Bx 1: LLE: Superficial and deep perivascular
lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with perivascular and interstitial

eosinophils consistent with a hypersensitivity rxn. Scabies neg.

- [**2100-7-13**]: Skin Bx 2: Atypical superficial and deep dermal
lymphoid infiltrate containing CD30-positive cells and showing
epidermotropism. PCR analysis for the T-cell receptor gamma gene
showed two sharp bands with a migration pattern suggestive of a
clonal rearrangement.
- [**2100-8-24**]: [**Hospital **] clinic: WBC 10.6 with 57% Lymphocytes S??????zary
cells.
Immunophenotypic analysis -> expanded T-cell population with
increased CD4:CD8 ratio (15) and loss of CD7. Due to her high
count of circulating S??????zary cells, she was felt to have Stage
[**Doctor First Name 690**] mycosis fungoides.
- [**2100-9-8**] CT scan: Infiltrating, hypo-enhancing lesion in the
R. kidney (?infiltrating neoplasm vs pyelonephritis) compatible
w/ lymphomatous involvement of the kidney but was not present on
a follow-up scan on [**2101-1-21**].
- [**9-30**]: Photopheresis therapy through an indwelling central
venous catheter, placed due to poor venous access.
- [**2101-1-5**]: Skin Bx 3: CTCL with large-cell transformation.
- [**2101-1-10**]: Interferon alpha at 3M units 3x/wk given w/ with
photopheresis every other week and PUVA.
- [**2101-1-26**]: Interferon alpha increased to 6Munits 3x/wk; PUVA was
d/ced [**12-26**] side effects.
- [**2101-2-23**]: Interferon alpha decreased to 4.5Munits 3x/wk on
[**2101-2-23**] b/c fatigued. Photopheresis was d/ced when catheter
removed due to a line infection (last treatment [**2101-3-10**]).
- [**2101-8-4**]: The patient presented for a follow-up evaluation with
clear evidence of disease progression. Interferon alpha was
increased to 6M units three times weekly and bexarotene was
started at 150mg daily, decreased to 75mg daily due to poor
tolerability.
- [**2101-8-25**]: Mtx added to interferon alpha and bexarotene and the
dose was up-titrated to 45mg weekly.
- [**2101-10-18**]: Hospital admission for severe lower extremity pain
at the site of new, large, papular skin lesions. Biopsy showed
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with large cell transformation,
involving the panniculus with an unusual angiocentric pattern.
The patient was prescribed vorinostat 400mg daily (started
[**2101-10-27**]) with continuation of interferon alpha 6M units TIW. Due
to thrombocytopenia, interferon alpha was decreased to 3M units
3x/wk.
- [**2101-12-22**]: Cycle 1 Day 1 liposomal doxorubicin plus gemcitabine.

Vorinostat and interferon alpha were d/ced. Side Effect: severe
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [**12-26**] to liposomal doxorubicin.

- [**2102-1-17**]: Cycle 1 Day 1 bortezomib plus gemcitabine,
dose-reduced during Cycle 2 due to neutropenia.
- [**2102-2-9**] 3M units TIW Interferon alpha restarted
- [**2102-3-9**]: Due to the observation that peripheral T-cells
contained floret-like nuclei, immunophenotypic analysis was
performed on peripheral blood, revealing findings consistent
with involvement by patient's known T cell lymphoproliferative
disorder as well as CD25 co-expression in a significant
population of the neoplastic CD3+ lymphocytes, suggesting a
diagnosis of HTLV-1 associated lymphoma. PCR for HTLV-1 DNA was
positive.
- [**2102-5-26**]: Following a treatment break, the patient was started
on pentostatin 4mg/m2 weekly x4 doses with reinitiation of
interferon alpha at 3Munits 3x/wkly , increased to 3M
units 5x/wkly. She d/ced therapy after 2 cycles in [**7-2**] in favor
of a Chinese herbal preparation she received in [**Location (un) 4708**].
- [**2102-8-18**]: Evaluation in the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 3242**] clinic: good candidate
for allo SCT.
- [**2102-9-26**]: CT scan: s/p 3 mo off therapy: stable to improved
disease: lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, are
stable to decreased in size since [**2102-7-28**], with no new pathologic
LAD identified. Decreased size of the previously enlarged
spleen, now within normal limits in size.
- [**2102-12-25**] Initiation of ONTAK therapy Cycle 1 [**2102-12-25**], Cycle 2
[**2103-1-15**], Cycle 3 [**2103-2-5**], Cycle 4 [**2103-2-26**], Cycle 5
[**2103-6-4**], Cycle 6 [**2103-7-2**]
- [**2103-4-26**]: 2 weeks of total skin electron beam therapy at the
[**Hospital3 2358**] under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Therapy was held

[**2103-5-18**] through [**2103-5-24**] [**12-26**] fatigue. She received a single dose
on Friday [**2103-5-25**].
- [**2103-5-29**]: Hypercalcemia: IVF and Zometa.
- [**2103-5-29**]: Treatment Discussion: Re: Total Skin Electron Beam
Therapy: Progressive Disease and Difficulty tolerating therapy.
Decision to resume ONTAK therapy with intention of initiating
auto-transplant as she demonstrates response.
-[**2103-7-11**]: admitted for AMS in the setting of hypercalcemia,
which was thought to be due to progression of ATLL. Started
[**Hospital1 **] [**7-11**], complicated by c dif, CMV viremia, DIC.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2103-8-12**]: Cardiac size is normal. ET tube tip is in a
standard position 3.8 cm above the carina. Right PICC tip is in
the mid SVC. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the proximal
SVC. There is no pneumothorax. New bibasilar opacities, left
greater than right, are a combination of pleural effusions and
atelectasis. Superimposed infection on the left cannot be
totally excluded.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.
.
HEAD MRI [**2103-8-12**]:
FINDINGS: There is mild prominence of sulci and ventricles
inappropriate for patient's age. There is no midline shift or
mass effect. There is no hydrocephalus. There is no acute
infarct seen on diffusion images. Following gadolinium, there is
no abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement
identified. In particular, there is no leptomeningeal
enhancement seen.
Soft tissue changes are visualized in the paranasal sinuses due
to mucosal thickening. Diffuse low signal is identified within
the bony structures,
which could be secondary to marrow hyperplasia. It should be
noted that on
FLAIR images, increased signal identified at the sulci at the
convexity is
secondary to these images were obtained following gadolinium.
IMPRESSION: No acute infarcts or enhancing brain lesions are
identified. No mass effect or hydrocephalus. Other findings as
described above.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**2103-8-12**]:
NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is no evidence of bowel
obstruction.
Nondistended air-filled large bowel loops are seen. There are no
pathologic intraabdominal calcifications.
.
CT Torso: [**2103-8-27**]
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Interval development of right middle upper lobe airspace
consolidation
most consistent with pneumonia, with additional focus of opacity
in the left perihilar region, possibly representing additional
focus of infection,
although enlargement of left hilar lymph nodes is difficult to
exclude.
Followup imaging following treatment to ensure resolution is
recommended.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Retroperitoneal adenopathy, grossly stable from [**2103-6-24**].
5. No intra-abdominal explanation for fever. Colon is diffusely
fluid-filled but thin-walled and without associated inflammatory
change. There is no loculated fluid collection or abscess
identified.
6. Diffuse soft tissue anasarca.
.
Bronchial Embolization: [**2103-9-4**].
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated embolization of the right bronchial
artery with
300-500 micron Embospheres until stasis was achieved.
.
CT Head [**2103-9-17**].
No acute hemorrhagic mass seen, nor large area of edema or mass
effect on non-contrast head CT. However, for evaluation of
subtle process,
MRI before and after IV gadolinium would be recommended for more
sensitive
evaluation.
.
Peripheral Blood Analysis:
Flow Analysis:
INTERPRETATION
More than 99% of the peripheral blood lymphocytes are
CD4-positive subset with co-expression of CD3, CD2, CD5.  They
have loss of expression of CD7.  About half of these T-cells
also express CD25.  These immunophenotypic findings and the
presence of ""floret-like cells"" in peripheral blood smear are
consistent with involvement by patient's known ""Adult T cell
leukemia/lymphoma"".

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] was a 47 year old lady with a diagnosis of
HTLV-1 associated Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma who initially
presented with hyerpcalcemia.  Her hospital course was
complicated by Mental Status changes which after ICE therapy
necessitating an admission to the ICU without any acute evidence
of an intracranial process. Her hospital course at this time was
also complicated by persistent ATLL, hypercalcemia, renal
tubular acidosis, acute renal failure, C. Diff colitis, and CMV
viremia.  Subsequently she developed hypoxic respiratory failure
secondary to invasive aspergillosis with pulmonary hemorrhage.
She underwent a pulmonary embolization procedure and a second
intubation and ICU stay.  Upon returning to the floor, no
additional therapeutic intervention was started for her ATLL.
Her mental status continued to deteroirate, and she stopped
taking PO.  Due to disease progression in addition to a
persistent fungal infection and concern for aspiration goals of
care were discussed with her family.  Due to her poor prognosis,
she was made DNR/DNI, and subsequently CMO.  She passed
peacefully on [**2103-9-23**].

would occur in various locations of her head, though more
recently she describes them as occuring just left of the vertex.
She would get these headaches about 20 days per months since its
onset in [**Month (only) **]. At its worst, the headache would go up to a [**6-16**]
in intensity and twice it resulted in her vomiting.
Occasionally,
it would be assoicated with photophobia but no son[**Name (NI) **]. Of
note, there is a positional nature to these headaches as she
says

lightheadedness with positional changes, but no vertigo. No
strength or sensory changes, no visual changes and no weight
loss
noted since [**Month (only) **]. Her parents have not noted any behavioral

IMAGING:
CT Head [**10-9**]:
1. A large lesion in the right frontal lobe, measuring 6.8 x 5.2
x 9 cm, seen to extend into the region of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the right lateral ventricle, and in proximity to the septum
pellucidum. Given the large size and lack of priors, the exact
site of origin of the lesion is not clear. This can either
represent a low-grade neoplasm vs a complex cyst, with the
differential diagnosis including subependymoma, pleomorphic
xanthoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, the latter two being less
likely given the pattern of enhancement and lack of
calcifications. An unusual complex cyst cannot be completely
excluded. The lesion does appear to have some vascularity, with
tiny vessels noted within the lesion. Wet read was entered on
[**2164-10-9**], soon after the study.

CT Head [**10-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Expected post-surgical changes, status post right frontal
mass removal.
2. Interval decrease of mass effect when compared to prior study
([**2164-10-11**]). No hemorrhage or major vascular territorial
infarction is noted.

MRI Head [**10-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of infarction.
2. FLAIR abnormality around the surgical resection margin may be
related to recent surgery, though residual tumor cannot be
excluded. While there is no abnormal enhancement, there is no
enhancement of the tumor prior to surgery, so this cannot be
used as metric.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after having an MRI of her
brain for consistent headaches as an outpatient which showed her
to have a right frontal mass which communicated with the right
lateral ventricle. She was evaluated by neuromedicine and
neurosurgery in the ED and was admitted to the neurosurgery
service. A CTA/V was obtained to gain information on the
vascularity of the mass. On the evening of [**10-10**] it was decided
that she would undergo surgical resection of the mass via
craniotomy on the morning of [**10-11**].  She remained stable on the
floor overnight and on [**10-11**] was taken to the OR for surgery.
Surgery was without complication. She was admitted to the ICU
but remained in the PACU overnight. Post op CT revealed good
resection and no hemorrhage.
ON POD#1 she was neurologically intact. She was cleared for
transfer to the floor. post op MRI was completed and also
revealed excellent resection. PCA was discontinued and she was
started on PO pain meds with IV for breakthourgh. She did
require some IV pain medication on [**10-13**] and remained on her PO
regimen. She was able to mobilize OOB on this day and walk
through the halls without difficulty. She was somewhat
orthostatic and complained of dizziness on [**10-14**] when ambulating
and she was started on 50cc/hr of IVF and had no further issues.


She was discharged to home on [**2164-10-15**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86yo man with h/o CAD, DM2, HTN, CRI, pancytopenia, a/w
hypothermia, bradycardia, profound pancytopenia, found to be
hypothyroid.
.
1. Hypothyroidism, Primary: patient was found to have TSH on
admit of 9.0, repeat was still elevated at 7.3; T4 was low at
3.9, c/w primary hypothyroidism; pt was started on Synthroid
112mcg/day. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was negative. Endocrine was consulted
and did not feel many of his symptoms were secondary to
hypothyroidism. They wanted to decrease his synthroid to 50 mcg,
recheck his TSH in 1 week and then decrease again to 25 mcg.
This should be done at rehab.

2. Bradycardia: thought likely [**2-19**] hypothyroidism, maintained on
on tele, had episodes of brady down to 35s occassionally with
longest pause 2.2 seconds. Cardiology evaluated while the
patient was in the MICU, said that the patient did not require
pacer but to continue to monitor for drops in pressure or
symptoms, which patient did not have during his hospital stay;
thought likely to resolve as Synthroid takes effect. Will need
outpatient follow up.
.
3. Hypotherm: also likely [**2-19**] hypothyroidism, will warm as
needed for now. Did not improve with synthroid. On discharge has
temp of 92.7, so there  is likely a central cause for this of
unknown etiology. The patient should be followed closely, if his
temp drops farther, he should be rewarmed.

4. Pancytopenia: patient was noted on admission to have WBC 1.9
down from baseline 6.0, Hct 26.2 down from baseline 30, plts 21
down from baseline 90-100. Patient currently receiving Epogen
?5000 or 20,000 units/week, received at the VA, but not followed
by a Hematologist. Has had fairly stable counts until [**2174**].  In
[**11-19**] anemia began, and was thought to be [**2-19**] kidney disease.
EGD and cspy in [**5-21**] were negative for bleed, iron studies were
c/w anemia of chronic disease with low retic count 1.7%. Heme
recommended increasing his Epo to 40,000 units per week, which
was initiated while he was in house on the night prior to his
discharge. Heme also noted that his peripheral smear contained
strange-looking cells suspicious for myelodysplastic process.
They do not feel that a BM biopsy would change his management,
but plan to follow him in clinic. Of note, the patient's WBC
count returned to the patient's normal range, his hct remained
stable after receiving 2 units PRBCs. His plt count remains low
but is slowly trending upwards. He has had no evid of bleeding
but we are holding ASA given this significant risk (he has a h/o
falls)
.
5. Blood sugars: pt has h/o DM2, was started on RISS as
glyburide was held, then patient became hyponatremic, possibly
because of hypothyroidism; was on a D5W drip briefly, RISS
adjusted to keep sugars in check; pt seems very sensative to
insulin at bedtime when he is not eating, so this scale was
decreased compared to his daytime dosing. If patient needs to be
started on a oral hypoglycemic, he should not be restarted on
his glyburide as it is renally cleared. Glipizide can be
considered.
.
6. ARF: pt's creatinine bumped to 4.1 from 3.5 on day prior to
discharge; likely prerenal in setting of overdiuresis, net
negative 1700 day prior. Rehydrated gently with 500cc, rechecked
BUN and Cr afterwards with resolution. Baseline Cr 3.5.
.
7. Constipation: possibly [**2-19**] hypothyroid, increased bowel
regimen
.
8. CAD: CEs flat, ASA held [**2-19**] low platelets; cont statin;
holding BB [**2-19**] AVB, bradycardia. He should not be restarted on a
beta blocker.
.
9. CHF: patient was initially felt to be a bit overloaded [**2-19**]
his CXR and his clinical presentation; this was thought to be
due to a combination of bradycardia, anemia and possible
infection; TTE showed LVH but no evid of worsening heart
function with LVEF>55%. Pt was initially diuresed with Lasix
40mg IV as needed, then became overdry with bump in creatinine,
was given some fluid back via NS boluses, and is being
discharged euvolemic.
.
10. ?LLL pna: thought to have evid of pna (?aspiration) on
initial CXR, started Levaquin x 7days ( started on [**1-6**] to stop
[**1-12**]). Needs 1 more day.
.
11. HTN: continued prazosin, increased to 2 mg prasozin at
night, also increased Hydralazine.  We avoided ACEI given
ARF/CRI, and avoided BB given profound bradycardia.
.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33815**] is a 26 y/o male with a history of polysubstance
abuse (recent xanax and percocet) who was sent in from
[**Hospital3 8063**] due to worseing agitation and altered mental
status. As per patient's fiancee, he stopped taking xanax and
percocet on [**2103-3-5**] and was withdrawing through the week. She
states that he had a seizure on [**2103-3-9**] in his home however did
not seek medical care. He continued to withdraw and on [**2103-3-13**]
she noted that he was hallucinating but was able to be
redirected. He continued to get worse and went to his
grandmother's house to be around a familiar environment. He
continued to hallucinate and appears to have called an ambulance
which took him to [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Hospital1 189**]. He was transferred
to [**Hospital3 8063**] which propmtly sent him to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was
apparently having paranoid delusion. During his time in the ED,
he was managed for hypokalemia and sent back to [**Hospital1 **]. He
spent the night at [**Hospital1 **] but got progressively more
confused and combatative and was put in restraints. He was given
3mg PO ativan, 100mg PO benadryl, 5mg PO haldol, and 200mg
thorazine over 6 hours, with reportedely minimal effect and was
sent back to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of DT's.
.
In the ED, patient was initially diaphoretic, agitated,
hallucinating, and tachycardic to 130's. He was taken straight
to psychiatric seclusion room with security presence. Initial
labs were notable for leukocytosis to 11.3 without significant
left shift.  Patient received 1LNS with 100mg thiamine, 1mg
folate and MVI. Also received 10mg po valium and 6mg IM and IV
lorazepam. On repeat exam, he was noted to be sleeping
peacefully. Prior to transfer, vitals were: Temp: 97.5 ??????F,
Pulse: 89, RR: 26, BP: 120/68, O2Sat: 99. He was given an
additional 2mg IV ativan just prior to transfer to floor for
worsening agitation.
.
On the floor the patient was noted to be hallucinating and
agitated which required restraints. He was given 2mg of IV
ativan and a liter of NS. Due to concern for DT's the MICU was
consulted and the patient was transferred to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was in restraints and
agitated. He was making inappropriate remarks and appeared to be
actively hallucinating. He was given 10mg of valium.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION
Mr. [**Known lastname 33815**] is a 26 y/o male with a history of polysubstance
abuse (recent xanax and percocet) who was sent in from
[**Hospital3 8063**] due to worsening agitation and altered
mental status.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
# Benzodiazepine withdrawal: Patient presented from [**Hospital1 **] with active hallucinations, agitation, tremors and
tachycardia. He was minimally responsive to external
stimulation. Due to his active hallucinations there was concern
for Delerium Tremens which is defined by hallucinations,
disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, fever, agitation, and
diaphoresis.  Once he arrived in the MICU he was loaded with po
valium 10 mg (totoal of 80 mg) q1h until his CIWA was less than
10.  We were quickly able to space out his CIWA to q4h and he
was called out to the medicine floor the following day. On the
medicine floor, he remained on a q4 CIWA scale and was noted not
to score for >24 hours before discharge.

# Substance Abuse: Patient has a significant history of
polysubstance abuse incudling benzo and narcotics. Following
clearance of his eSocial work and psychiatry were consulted and
recommended disharge home with outpatient substance abuse
counseling.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Elavil 50 q.h.s., Dulcolax prn,
Thorazine 100 q.h.s., Zantac 150 q.h.s., Combivent two puffs
prn, Colace 100 b.i.d., [**Last Name (un) **]-Dur 200 b.i.d., Lasix 80 q.d.,
glyburide 100 b.i.d., 2 liters of O2 at home, Xanax .25
q.h.s. prn, enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d., Albuterol
nebulizers q.i.d. and regular insulin sliding scale.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.1.  Blood
pressure 120/55.  Sating 1% on 2 liters.  HEENT was
unremarkable.  Neck was supple.  Cardiovascular regular rate
and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  1 out of 6 systolic ejection
murmur.  Lungs had bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen was benign.
Lower extremity revealed 2+ bilateral edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
MICU where he was put on CPAP and diuresed aggressively.  By
hospital day two he was down to 2 liters by nasal cannula and
sating in the 98% range.  He was believed to be near his
baseline.  His lungs sounded course, but he was moving good
air.  He was called out to the floor.  On the floor he
continued to do well.  He was switched from his Combivent
inhaler and given Flovent inhaler and deemed safe to go home.
He received steroids for a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare in the unit, but on the floor no steroids were
required.  He had no evidence for pneumonia and was never
treated for any antibiotics.  We will send him out on a
regular daily dose of Lasix and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease medications.

We believe the source of his problems included poor medical
compliance.  On questioning the patient states he always
takes his medications, although in speaking with the family
there is some doubt about this.  Furthermore he states he
consumes large quantities of salt and water.  He was advised
that he needs to comply with his medications and watch his
salt and fluid intake.  We will send him home with [**Hospital6 3429**] to evaluate his dietary habits and his home
medication compliance.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

FOLLOW UP:  With is primary care physician.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Unchanged from admission with only
the addition of Flovent two puffs b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
2.  Congestive heart failure flare.
3.  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

ADDENDUM:  This is a Discharge Summary Addendum for hospital
course from [**2114-3-23**] to [**2114-3-26**].  Please
see prior Discharge Summary by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] summarizing the
patient's Intensive Care Unit hospital course.

The patient was maintained on a one-to-one security sitter
after transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the medicine
floor.  The patient remained fairly anxious.  The patient was
given Valium per CIWA scale.  The patient received sedation
in the Intensive Care Unit and had baseline agitation
anxiety, also with a depressed mental status secondary to
sedation in the Intensive Care Unit.

The patient was followed by the Psychiatry Service who
recommended continuing standing as needed Haldol and security
sitter.  The patient's home dose psychiatric medications were
held given his mental status.  His home dose psychiatric
medications included Effexor, BuSpar, and Seroquel; and these
were not given to the patient during this time period.

The patient remained stable from a medical point of view;
however, the patient remained on the Medicine Service and was
followed by the Psychiatry team.  Consideration for transfer
to inpatient psychiatric facility was recommended by the
medical team.

The patient was requesting to leave repeatedly.  The patient
felt somewhat slowed but did not feel confused and was less
agitated.  However, the Psychiatry Service recommended
maintaining the one-to-one sitter and as needed Haldol.  His
Effexor was restarted as well as his BuSpar; however,
Seroquel was still held.

Given that the patient was at risk of elopment, a discussion
with Psychiatry resulted in discontinuation of the one-to-one
security sitter, Haldol was discontinued, and the patient was
deemed ready to be discharged to home with follow up with his
primary care physician.

Per report, the patient did elope even though he was
medically ready to be discharged.

History of Present Illness:
61 y/o male with history of right lung Non Small Cell Cancer,
s/p right upper lobe lobectomy, severe COPD, and a history of
MRSA and psuedomanous PNA who presents from ED to ICU with
hypoxia and possible PNA. He recently had a 3 week
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and treated for a
pneumonia with Bactrim (for MRSA) and levaquin (for
pseudomonas). He was discharged on [**8-6**] but continued to feel
SOB and was readmitted several days later where he grew out
pseudomonas Resistant to ciprofloxacin. Workup also included a
CXR which showed a question of interstitial process and CTA was
negative for PE but did reveal bilateral patchy infiltrates in
middle and lower lobes bilaterally c/w pneumonia. Pt was treated
with vancomycin and ceftaz during this hospital course, and was
discharged on prednisone taper.
.
He was doing well at home until 1 week PTA when he reports onset
of fevers to 101, weakness, SOB, pleuritic CP, cough. Denies any
arm or jaw pain, diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations. ROS + for
photophobia, dizziness with some balance loss, but no loss of
consciousness over this time period as well.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o M w/ h/o NSCLC s/p RUL lobectomy, severe COPD, recurrent
pna over past couple months, with righ sided PNA
(MRSA/Pseudomonas) and severe hypoxia requiring significant O2
suppplementation.
.
1. PNA with Severe Hypoxia: Had right multilobar PNA with
MRSA/Pseudomonas growing from sputum, with WBC count of 9,000
and bandemia as high as 22%, elevated anion gap, and elevated
lactate to 2.4. Also has poor underlying lung function from COPD
(FEV 1.2L in [**2181-7-20**]) and h/o right upper lobe lobectomy.
Patient was initially treated with high flow face mask of 15 L
at 40% with additional NC with saturations varying from 88 to
98%, but with continued frequent coughing which causes
desaturations. The patient has since decreased his oxygen
requirement to Venti amsk at 12 lpm with O2 sats rangin 89 to
97%. The patient continues to cough and is draining sputum well
with transition from dark brown thick sputum to thinner
grey/clear sputum. The patient had one episode small volume
blood tinged sputum on [**2181-9-24**] attributed to inflammation from
underlying PNA. The patient is currently being treated with
Linezolid for a planned 21 day course for MRSA as well as
Ceftazidime, again for a planned 21 day course for Pseudomonas.
Amikacin was added for syndergy and to avoid resistance with a
planned 14 day course (ending dates specified on discharge
meds). The patient will be discharged with need for  continued
O2 suppplementation to keep sats >90% and <94% with O2 weaning
as possible. The patient will continue to require ongoing Chest
PT and physical therapy as well.
.
2. COPD: Has h/o COPD on montelukast, spiriva, advair, flovent,
prednisone 10mg at home with PFT's showing FEV of 1.2 L (42%
predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio of 42 (59% predicted), 6 L TLC, and
elevated Residual Volume (193% predicited). He was given Advair,
Monteleukast, Prednisone 60 mg DAily tapered down to 30 mg Daily
as well as Atrovent nebulizers. The patient is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 14069**], his outpatient pulmonolgist with whom he should continue
to be followed after discharge.
.
3. Anxiety: Patient was experiencing a significant amount fo
anxiety during this admission, likely at least partly
attributable to his air hunger. The patient was maintained on
Clonopin with hold parameters with Ativan rescues as needed.
.
4. Acute renal failure: Patient presented with ARF with Cr to
2.8 which resolved rapidly with fluids down to baseline of 0.7.
.
5. Chest Pain: Had right sided chest pain, which is diffuse and
pleuritic, likely due to PNA. Treated with MSSR 45 mg [**Hospital1 **] and IV
morphine for breakthrough pain.
.
6. Abdominal pain: Patient has been experiencing ongoing
abdominal pain for a few days. A KUB showed a non-obstructive
bowel gas patterns and the patient's ostomy continues to drain
well. The patient has good appetite without Nausea/vomiting. C.
Diff was negative x 1. The patient did have an elevated
amylase/lipase, now trending down. Pain did not radiate to back
and again patient was tolerating PO well without any
exacerbation of pain. The patient's symptoms are exacerbated
with coughing and are likely secondary to musculoskeletal strain
from frequent coughing. Treating pain as above with MS SR 45 [**Hospital1 **]
with rescue doses.
.
6. Transaminitis: Presented with elevated liver enxymes which
trended down to normal. Hepatitis panel negative for Hep B or C.

.
7. H/o LLL nodule and several other areas of focal scarring:
should be followed with serial CT scans in the future by
outpatient providers.
.
8. H/o right upper lobe lung ca: Not active currently. Sputum
for cytology was negative for malignant cells. No history of
chemo or radiation.
.
9. H/o thrush: Likely related to inhaled staeroids. Continued
his outpt nystatin.
.
10. Steroid Induced Hyperglycemia: Treated with 70/30 insulin
[**Hospital1 **] at AM dose of 40 and PM dose of 22.
.
11. Anemia: Labs consistant with Anemia of chronic disease. Also
was guaiac positive. Needs to be followed in the future. He is
s/p colectomy for Ulcerative colitis.
.
12. Ulcerative colitis: S/P colectomy and ileostomy. Not on any
medications for UC.

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain. Transferred from OSH.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with stent placed in CBD [**2195-12-24**]
Endotracheal intubation [**2195-12-24**]; extubated [**2195-12-29**]

History of Present Illness:
67 yo male, h/o 3vd, [**Month/Day/Year **] s/p ablation in [**4-27**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], RA,
diastolic dysfunction, who presented from [**Hospital 1263**] hospital with
?biliary sepsis.  Pt reports that on day of admission, he woke
up with malaise, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and rigors.  He went
to [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] ED, found to be febrile with abnormal LFT's, was
started on antibiotics  (clinda/ceftaz) and IVF, and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed biliary sepsis and further
management.  On transfer, he was started on zosyn/levo/flagyl,
was hemodynamically unstable, was intubated prior to ERCP.  ERCP
showed no obstruction, no stones, some biliary sludging only
(normal cholangiogram).  A stent was placed in the CBD.  He
continued to by hypotensive/unstable post ERCP, was found to
have an evolving NSTEMI (tnt leak, 2mm ST depre in v3-v6; peak
tnt 1.8, now trended down).  He remained intubated.  SWAN on
[**12-24**] showed PCWP 35, BP 95/43, FA=22, and the next warning, he
went into rapid afib with decompensation requiring single 200 J
shock.  He was on 3 pressors at the time (levophed, vasopressin,
dopa), converted into NSR temporarily, was started on amio. He
had recurrence of afib.  DCCV was repeated 2 times without
success; he spontaneously reverted to NSR (?s/p DCCV on [**12-26**])
has remained in this rhythm, and is on an amio taper (drip).
Cardiology is following.  Etiology of this new onset afib was
thought to be in the setting of volume resuscitation and acute
illness.

With respect to his sepsis, he required 3 pressors as above, was
on vanco/zosyn/lev/flagyl.  Blood cultures from [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] grew out
[**4-26**] E. coli (with E. coli also in urine) resistant to
amp/pip/sulbactam.  Ciprofloxacin was added to regimen on [**12-26**].
He is currently just on cipro and is to complete a 14 day course
for E. coli.  He continued to improve clinically, was extubated
on [**12-29**], and he was transferred to the floor on [**12-30**] (stable,
mentating).  Other MICU events include a drop in platelets
following 48 hours of heparin therapy (HIT negative, Hep d/c'ed,
and platelets recovering).  He had a bump in his creatinine to
3.0 (baseline 1.3-1.5 as per PCP) which is resolving (?ATN [**2-23**]
hypotension but no muddy brown casts on sediment).  Renal US was
obtained that did not show hydronephrosis or cause or ARF.  Hct
has been stable, but he has been guaiac positive on exam.  Pt
was stable on transfer to the floor.

PORTABLE RENAL ULTRASOUND: Limited views of both kidneys were
obtained. The right kidney measures 11.7 cm. The left kidney
measures 11.2 cm. There is no evidence of renal stones,
hydronephrosis, or perinephric fluid collections.

IMPRESSION:
Limited portable exam shows no significant abnormalities.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2195-12-24**] 3:21 AM
An AP portable study of the chest was obtained. No prior studies
available for comparison. There is poor inspiratory effort. The
lungs are clear of an active congestion or infiltration. No
evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothoraces. The cardiac size
cannot be evaluated on this AP portable study of the chest. A
left subclavian CVP line is in place the tip is entering the
superior vena cava.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of active diseases in the lungs or
heart.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) PORT  [**2195-12-24**] 6:44 PM: There are multiple
mildly gas distended loops of small bowel and gas present in the
colon. A plastic biliary stent is present in the right upper
quadrant. The diaphragms are not included on the film.

IMPRESSION: Mildly gas distended loops of small bowel,
nonspecific.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2195-12-24**] 3:53 AM:
FINDINGS: Examination is limited due to patient body habitus.
Allowing for this, liver appears echogenic, consistent with
fatty infiltration. No focal masses are identified. There is no
intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The common bile
duct measures 6 mm in diameter. The gallbladder contains sludge,
but there are no secondary signs of cholecystitis. Specifically,
there is no wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, or gallbladder
distention. Normal color flow is identified within the main
portal and hepatic veins. There is no ascites. Note is made of a
markedly atrophic right kidney, with evidence of cortical
thinning.

IMPRESSION:

1) Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Please
note that more severe forms of liver disease, including
significant hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, cannot be excluded
on the basis of this study.

2) Gallbladder sludge but no secondary signs of cholecystitis.

3) No evidence of biliary obstruction.

4) Patent portal and hepatic veins

 Ref.Phys.: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
Birth Date: [**2128-11-8**] (67 years) Instrument: TJF 160
ID#: [**Numeric Identifier 59999**] ASA Class: P2
Medications: General anesthesia

Indications: 67 y o male with nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain,
elevated LFT and hypotension. ERCP to evaluate for biliary
obstruction. Level 3 consult was performed.

Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. The
patient was placed in the prone position and an endoscope was
introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct
visualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached.
Careful visualization was performed. The procedure was not
difficult. The quality of the preparation was good. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Major papilla was located inside a diverticulum.

Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in complete opacification. The
procedure was not difficult. An additional cannulation attempt
of the biliary duct was successful and superficial with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in partial opacification. The procedure was
not difficult.
Biliary Tree: Normal cholangiogram without biliary obstruction.
Small stone in CBD can't be ruled out.  Opacified portion of
pancreatic duct in the head was normal.
Procedures: A 9 cm by 10 fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was
placed successfully in the CBD .
Impression: 1. Major papilla was located inside a diverticulum.

2. Normal cholangiogram without biliary obstruction. Small stone
in CBD can't be ruled out.

3. Given sepsis of unclear source and the fact that a small
stone could not be ruled out, a  9 cm by 10 fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **]
biliary stent was placed successfully in the CBD.

4. Opacified portion of pancreatic duct in the head was normal.

Additional notes: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(attending physician) and ERCP fellow.






Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 67 yo male, h/o severe 3vd, RA, presenting from OSH with
?biliary sepsis, s/p ERCP with stent placed, being treated for
urosepsis vs biliary sepsis, extubated and doing well.

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial picture was consistent with
septic + cardiogenic shock. Initial SG numbers revealed high
SVR, low CO, and high PCWP. He remained hypotensive despite IVF,
and pressors were continued, with eventual triple pressor
therapy (Levo, Dopamine and Vasopressin) required for
hemodynamic support. A random cortisol was 20, and 29
post-cosyntropin. Despite appropriate response, the low random
cortisol prompted initiation of steroid therapy, initially
Dexamethasone, then hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone with plan
to complete 7 days of Rx (completed). His lactate, elevated on
admission, came down. He was successfully weaned off Levo and
Vasopressin on [**2195-12-28**], then off Dopamine on [**2195-12-29**]. ERCP did
not show obstruction, ?biliary sludge.  He was initially on
vanco/zosyn/flagyl-->cipro/vanco/flagyl.  Vanco/flagyl were
discontinued on [**12-27**] (c. diff neg x 3), and he will continue a
course of cipro for ?urosepsis.  All cultures here have been
NGTD, but he is being treated for [**4-26**] E. coli blood culture
bottles at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**].  Ciprofloxacin was continued for the 14 day
course (until [**1-9**]).  He was hemodynamically stable throughout
hospitalization.  Blood pressure medications were initially held
[**2-23**] hypotension.  Lisinopril was restarted prior to discharge
after renal function improved.  Atenolol was held given patient
was still on amiodarone taper.  This should be restarted after
he follows up with his PCP/cardiologist.

2. NSTEMI: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by
troponin elevation felt secondary to demand in the setting of
acute illness (peak troponin 1.86). He received 48 hours of
intravenous heparin, D/C'd in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
An echo was performed on [**12-25**], which revealed severe global LV
hypokinesis with EF<25%. Cardiology followed in-house.
Lisinopril, ASA, were continued. Lipitor was added upon
discharge at a lower dose, and atenolol was held.  This should
be restarted when amiodarone taper is completed and he follows
up with his primary cardiologist.  He also had an echo in-house
showing a very depressed EF (<25%), likely [**2-23**] myocardial
suppression from sepsis.  He should have a follow up TTE after
discharge from rehab.

3. Afib: Patient went into atrial fibrillation on [**12-25**] with RVR
and hypotension. Cardioversion was attempted without success. He
was loaded with amiodarone IV and an amiodarone drip was
initiated. He converted to NSR in PM. Then, he reverted back
into afib on [**12-26**] after an increase in dopamine dose to 3
(?true-true and unrelated?). Given low cardiac output and
ongoing hypotension requiring 3 pressors, cardioversion was
performed with conversion to NSR after a single 200J shock. The
patient was switched to PO amiodarone on [**12-26**], to be continued
TID until [**1-2**], then [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week, then QD for 1 week, then
200 mg PO QD until cardiology follow-up. He remained in NSR
throughout hospitalization after transfer out of the unit.  His
atenolol was held and should be restarted after he finishes his
amiodarone taper and follows up with his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was started on fondaparinux/coumadin for
anticoagulation (afib and low EF).  Goal INR is [**2-24**],
fondaparinux can be d/c'ed when INR=1.8.

4. ARF on CRF: Per patient's PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], baseline
creatinine around 1.3-1.5. Peak creatinine 3.0 at OSH. Mr. [**Known lastname **]
was initially oliguric on admission. His urine output slowly
improved with better hemodynamics, with slowly improving
creatinine. Urine lytes suggestive of renal etiology (likely ATN
[**2-23**] hypotension from sepsi), and urine sediment bland. Currently
2.1, and auto-diuresing and mobilising fluid. RUS without
evidence of hydronephrosis or other abnormality.  His creatinine
returned to baseline (1.3) and was stable on discharge.  He
diuresed very well on IV lasix (goal 2L/d).  He was discharge on
PO bumex 1 mg daily.  This should be continued until he is
clinically euvolemic and his peripheral edema is resolved.

5. Transaminitis: s/p ERCP with stent placement, but only
finding of sludge. Query transaminitis in setting of sepsis.
LFT's were back to normal at time of discharge.  They should be
checked within a week of discharge.  Lipitor was restarted at
lower dose upon discharge and can be titrated up.

7. Thrombocytopenia: While in ICU, platelets were noted to drop
to a nadir in the 80s. Concern for HIT was raised and Heparin
was discontinued after 48 hours of therapy. HIT screen negative.
Picture no c/w DIC. Ultimately, thrombocytopenia was felt
medication-induced, query direct effect of Heparin versus
antibiotics (vanco, Flagyl). Now slowly rising.  This was likley
multifactorial in the setting of sepsis, medications, pressors
and not [**2-23**] heparin.  Platelets continued to go up and were
stable at time of discharge.

8.  ?Glucose intolerance: continue on SSI, no history of DM,
likely in setting of steroids for sepsis.  SSI should be
continued as long as pt has abnormal blood sugars.  If this
intolerance persists, PCP should recommend further therapy.

9.  Code: Full

10.  Dispo: Patient was seen by physical therapy in house and
was thought to require acute level rehabilitation for
deconditioning. He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabiliation for
physical therapy and diuresis.

Discharge Instructions:
1.  Please take all your medications as described in the
discharge instructions.  We made a few changes to your
medication regimen.

-We added Bumex 1 mg PO qam, for diuresis.  Goal is 2L neg/day
until you are clinically euvolemic, peripheral edema is
resolved.
- You should finish a course of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin);
continue until [**1-9**], for positive blood cultures
- You can continue the oxybutynin for bladder spasms if you
continue to requires this
- We started you on Fondaparinux and coumadin (anticoagulation

- We also decreased your lipitor to 40 qd.  You should increase
this after having your LFT's rechecked by your PCP.

2.  Follow up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], within 1 week of
leaving rehab.  He may want to make adjustments to your
medication regimen at this time.  You should also follow up with
the cardiology clinic here and your rheumatologist upon leaving
rehab.

3.  Call your physician if you experience chest pain, shortness
of breath, fevers > 101. Take your medications as prescribed.

Chief Complaint:
renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
53 year old man with h/o AML s/p allo cord transplant (now day
+516) complicated by chronic GVHD with arthritis, BOOP, who
presented to the BMT floor from clinic with worsening renal
function(2.3) and hyperkalemia, and worsening odynophagia on
[**2185-4-20**].

On arrival to the BMT floor, as he was transitioning into the
bed, he became mom[**Name (NI) 11711**] unresponsive to verbal stimuli and
physical stimuli. No jerking movements or incontience were
noted. A code blue was called. On arrival of the code team, BP
124/80, Hr 70s, satting 100% on 5L NC. He was responsive to
verbal stimuli and answering questions appropriately. He does
not recall only seconds of the entire episode; wife notes that
his eyes were closed. 1 amp of D50, 10units regular insulin, and
abuterol nebs were given for known hyperkalemia. An EKG was
obtained which showed isolated peaked T waves. CXR showed no
interval change when accounted for technique from prior in the
day. During this time, he did experience a headache that was
located in the forhead, temples and described as a pressure /
squeeze that he has experienced with prior tension headaches.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further cardiac
monitoring. During this time, he was also noted to have some
tremors in hands and legs, but this was not associated with any
loss of consciousness or loss of consciousness. These episodes
will occur for only seconds at a time and tend to occur when he
is holding objects in his hands / intention tremor. He has not
had formal workup for this, but there was no clear etiology to
this tremor (which has been present intermittently over the past
2 years) to date.
His wife also relays the presence of intermittent episodes of
unresponsiveness over the past x2 years ago at a frequency of
1-2x per week lasting only seconds at a time. This has not been
formally evaluated to date.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary of Hospital Course: 53 year old man with h/o AML s/p
allo cord transplant (day +516 on admission) complicated by
chronic GVHD with arthritis, BOOP, who now presents to clinic
with acute on chronic renal failure. Hospital course complicated
by syncopal episode the day of admission resulting in Code Blue
and hyperkalemia, requiring brief ICU admission.

#Syncope: Patient had syncopal episode the day of admission,
where he was unresponsive for ~1 minute while lying flat.
Unclear etiology, possible due to orthostatic hypotension (noted
to have orthostatic physiology in the ICU and on the floor) vs
arrythmia vs seizure activity. Of note, (per wife), patient has
had many of these episodes recently (~2 years, ~1-2 episodes per
week). Patient denied any heralding symptoms and was not
post-ictal afterwards, but was noted to have a resting tremor in
the MICU. His history of tremor is not consistent wtih seizure
activity. It appears to be an intention tremor that gets worse
when holding on to objects and is low in amplitude while high in
frequency, bilateral and not associated with change in
consciousness or incontinence.

Noted to be hyperkalemic during the code, given amp D50 and 10 U
insulin peri-code and kayexalate in the ICU, with drop in
potassium down to 4.0 on discharge.   Neurology consulted on
patient who recommended EEG and possible midodrine or fluorinef
support. Held patient's lisinopril, but continued him on his
carvedilol 12.5 mg PO BID as this was recently decreased in the
setting of light headedness/dizziness by his cardiologist on
[**3-21**], although informed him not to take the medication if he had
any pre-syncopal symptoms. Medication can be decreased at the
discretion of his cardiologist. Patient had no further syncopal
episodes or events on telemetry in the ICU or on the floor.
Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG, possible blood
pressure support with midodrine or fluorinef, at the discretion
of the patient's outpatient oncologist and nephrologist. Was
noted to not have any telemetry events or syncopal events while
ambulating, with appropriate increase in pulse and blood
pressure. and requested to be discharged with outpatient syncope
work-up. Outpatient TTE, EEG, carotid U/S, and holter monitering
were arranged prior to discharge.

#Acute on chronic renal failure: Noted to have mildly elevated
Cre to 2.3 in clinic the day of admission. Creatine has
fluctuated over the past two years, with several episodes of
acute renal failure while hospitalized. Followed by nephrology
as an outpatient. Per outpatient notes, etiology of CKD thought
to be [**2-14**] ATN that has not resolved, medication effect in the
setting of bactrim, voriconazole, lisinopril, or AIN. Less
likely due to AML infiltration of kidneys (very rare) or
chemotherapy. Unlikely progressive glomerular disease given
patient only has scant proteinuria. Patient has refused renal
biopsy in the past. Baseline Cre has been 1.4-2.0 over the past
few months.  Lisinopril was held. Cellcept was decreased to
[**Telephone/Fax (3) 39636**] as GFR was ~30. Oral fluid intake encouraged. Renal
failure resolved to baseline creatinine (1.9) on discharge.
Renal did not have chance to formally consult on patient since
he requested discharge, but stated informally that they had no
further recommendations as an inpatient since he was refusing
renal biopsy, and he could be accommodated very soon in renal
clinic with his current outpatient nephrologist.

#Congestive Heart Failure: Euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic on
exam. Requested TTE as outpatient. Continued home meds including
aspirin, beta-blocker. Held ACEI due to hyperkalemia.

#AML: allo SCT +519 days. counts stable. continued prophylactic
medications. Arranged to follow up with outpatient oncologist.

#Epigastric discomfort: Gastritis, likely in setting of
prednisone. Patient has tried and failed Nexium, reporting it
has not helped his gastritis for 3 months. Relieved with
protonix, which was added to med list on discharge. Can obtain
prior authorization from PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5564**].

History of Present Illness:
(PER MICU ADMITTING TEAM)
74F with h/o CAD, DMII, CHF (unknown EF), Afib, and COPD
presenting with weakness.  As per family, patient had been well
in USOH until beginning of [**Month (only) **] when she developed flu-like
symptoms.  Myalgias continued for several days followed by
development of n/v/diarrhea on [**12-29**].  History was
characterized by almost daily diarrhea (watery, non-bloody) and
vomiting after most meals (occurring 30min to 1hr, non-bloody).
Only able to take small amounts of food/water.  Denies
fevers/chills/rigors/abd pain.  Family describes that patient
increasingly fatigued and tired.  Too weak and tired to present
to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3011**] -> came into ED by family.
.
In ED, initially triaged w/ bp 148/86, on re-check in triage
found to be hypotensive 70/20 w/ HR 39.  Treated for symptomatic
bradycardia [**1-24**] BB o/d -> rec'd 1amp cacl, 0.5mg atropine, [**12-24**]
amp d5 (bs was 73), then 1 amp sodium bicarb and glucagon.
Again rec'd atropine, cacl, and glucagon. Also 2L NS, CTX 1g x1.
Uo in ED 700cc.
.
(PER FLOOR ADMITTING TEAM)
Briefly, patient is a 74F CAD, DMII, CHF (EF 70%), COPD who was
admitted to the MICU for bradycardia and hypotension. She had
presented to the ED with several weeks of
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea; she was found to be in acute renal
failure with Cr 6.7, which was treated with IV fluid boluses;
she was treated for symptomatic bradycardia with atropine,
calcium gluconate, and glucagon. Bradycardia was thought to be
[**1-24**] decreased clearance of nodal agents, and they were held,
with improvement of bradycardia. Hypotension was attributed to
dehydration, Cr improved with fluids.  Nausea/Vomiting was
attributed to ARF, which improved with improved hydration, and
patient was able to tolerate solid fluids evening before
transfer to floor. On interview, patient reported she was
feeling well and denied any complaints of difficulty breathing,
abdominal pain, chest pain, or nausea/vomiting. Patient did
report lethargy.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION: Somewhat prominent small bowel and large bowel gas
pattern.
.
RENAL U/S
IMPRESSION: Bilateral nephrolithiasis. The numerous calculi seen
in the left kidney with obstruction of the left upper pole
raises the suspicion of a staghorn calculus. This is confirmed
on the prior CT scan from [**2170-8-23**].
.
ECHO
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 74 year-old female with CAD, DMII, CHF, AFib, and
COPD who was initially admitted to the MICU for bradycardia,
hypotension, and acute renal failure. The following issues were
addressed during her hospital stay:
.
# HYPOTENSION/BRADYCARDIA
In the MICU, hypotension/bradycardia was attributed to decreased
clearance of nodal agents in setting of ARF (vs. accidental
overdose on medications). Patient responded well to IV fluid
boluses and withholding of anti-hypertensives (patient was on
significant doses of Coreg and Cartia). Clinical suspicion for
tamponade was low, and no pulsus on exam was noted; ECHO
confirmed clinical suspicion. On transfer to the floor,
hypotension was no longer an issue, and medications were
cautiously added at lower dosages. Patient to follow-up with PCP
and cardiologist for further titration of medications as
tolerated.
.
# DIARRHEA/NAUSEA/VOMITING/ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Patient without history of renal insufficiency admitted with Cr
of 6.7. Patient with long course of what appeared to be viral
gastrointestinal illness precipitating dehydration and worsening
renal function. No other source could be identified, stool
assays were unremarkable. Renal U/S was with evidence of
nephrolithiasis with focal hydronephrosis, but this was
unchanged from a prior study. ARF was pre-renal in nature, and
highly responsive to IV fluid hydration. Patient's Cr steadily
improved to 0.9 on discharge. Patient was referred to Urology as
an outpatient for further work-up of kidney stones. Patient's
nausea/vomiting improved as renal function returned to baseline,
and patient was tolerating PO meals x 48 hours at time of
discharge.
.
# CHF
Lasix was initially held in setting of hypotension. Clinical
exam for the first several days remained without evidence of
fluid overload. ECHO showed 4+ TR, patient highly pre-load
dependent. Lasix and Spironolactone were added back as blood
pressure improved. To follow-up with outpatient cardiologist.
.
# CAD
Patient was chest-pain free on admission. Serial cardiac enzymes
were negative for acute coronary syndrome, in investigating
etiology for bradycardia and hypotension. ASA and Zocor were
continued at outpatient dosages. Quinapril was held secondary to
above reasons, and added back when tolerated.
.
# COPD
Patient was maintained on Atrovent QID, and was without
difficulty breathing or desaturation as inpatient.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
Patient's INR was supratherapeutic on admission. Coumadin was
re-started once INR < 3.

uvular swelling.  Pt reports that he was walking to the bathroom
at midnight when he noted the onset of a swelling sensation in
his throat with difficulty and mild pain on swallowing.  He also
notes mild lip swelling.  No urticaria, flushing, pruritis, or
lightheadedness.  No fevers, cough, swollen lymph nodes, sore
throat, or purulent sputum.  He has stable rhinorrhea worst at

leading to his esophageal dilatation several years ago.  The
patient does recall one similar prior episode a few years ago
after eating a [**Location (un) 6002**].  At an OSH ED, he was given some
medications and the swelling resolved after several hours; this
was attributed to mayonnaise. He has tolerated this fine since
and denies mayonnaise or other new foods recently.  He reports
being on lisinopril for 2-3 years; he believes he was taking it
at the time of this previous episode. His only new medication is
ferrous sulfate, started yesterday AM.  He has not taken ASA or
NSAIDs in at least 4 months due to his renal failure.  No insect
stings or chemical exposures.  No chronic abdominal pain or
family history of angioedema.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo man with DM, CAD, GERD, chronic sinusitis, asthma, s/p
esophageal dilatation p/w angioedema.
.
# Angioedema: C/w angioedema.  Most commonly associated with
ACE-I.  Does have a history of similar episode; acquired C1
inhibitor deficiency possible - familial less likely given age
and absence of family hx.  Did just start iron supplement and
allergy to a component is possible, but time course not as
consistent and more likely kinin-mediated rather than mast cell
given absence of urticaria, prurutis.  No inhalant abuse; not
taking ASA or NSAIDS due to renal failure. Pharyngitis can cause
uvular swelling but no fever, exudates, or sore throat to
suggest acute infectious etiology.  Lisinopril was held on
admission and the patient was instructed not to resume this
medication.  Complement levels were checked.  His angioedema
resolved completely by the end of the day and he was discharged.
.
# HTN: He was restarted on home blood pressure medications
except for lisinopril.  Blood pressure was controlled and he was
discharged with instructions to f/u with his PCP.
.
# DM: He reports episodes of hypoglycemia at home in the 50s and
Lantus was recently lowered.  His Glyburide was stopped on
admission due to his end stage renal disease.  He will continue
to monitor his blood sugars regularly at home.
.
# ESRD: In work-up for PD and transplant. Sevelamer and
calcitriol continued.
.
# CAD: Stable: Simvastatin and b-blocker continued.
.
# CHF: Euvolemic: Home lasix dose continued.

Left Foot Infection, DKA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24962**] underwent podiatric surgery on [**2149-2-24**] to for left
wound debriment and underwent wound closure on [**2149-3-3**].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14611**] is a 49 year old male with a history of type II
diabetes, charcot's foot s/p multiple surgeries, and previous
MRSA infection who presented to his podiatrist on [**2149-2-21**] with
two days of nausea, vomiting (clear, non-bilious, non bloody) ,
productive cough (sputum color not noted), fatigue, and pain and
redness of his left foot.  He was found to have a draining wound
(approximately 1 cm in width x 1 cm in depth) on his left lower
leg, just superior to the lateral malleolus with an area of
surrounding cellulitis. He was transferred to the Emergency
Department for treatment with IV antibiotics, and observation.
Of note is that the patient missed his last four doses of lantus
insulin, due to running out of medication.
.
In the ED his vitals were: T 99.3, HR 102, BP 134/74, R 18, and
O2 sat 100% on room air.  Labs were drawn and significant for a
glucose of 377, Anion Gap of  24, lactate of 1.2 and ketones in
this urine, consistent with Diabetic Ketoacidosis. He was given
6 units of insulin, 2 liters of IV fluid, a dose of Vancomycin
x1 (for cellulitis), and a percocet in the ED and transferred to
the MICU for further management of his DKA and infection.
.
In the MICU he was treated with his 5th liter of normal saline
and started on an insulin drip. He was continued on Vancomycin
and started on Zosyn. He was stable with a heart rate of  77 and
a blood pressure of 140/66. Podiatry reported that plain film
imaging showed ""interval osteolysis adjacent to the fixation
screws that is suggestive of infection or interval losening"".
Blood and swab cultures were obtained, and a urine culture was
negative for growth. Mr. [**Known lastname 14611**] developed skin reactions in the
MICU on his back and neck, consistent with a similar exanthem
his developed in [**2148-10-12**] during his previous admission
and was seen by dermatology. He  was subsequently admitted to
the [**Doctor Last Name **] B service of CC7.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14611**] is a 49 year old male with a history of type II
diabetes, charcot's foot s/p multiple surgeries, and previous
MRSA infections who presents with left foot cellulitis,
ulceration, and a resolving DKA. He developed drug rash allergy
on his neck and back while in the ED.
.
1. Left foot abscess/cellulitis/drug reaction:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14611**] presented to his podiatrist on [**2149-2-21**] with two days
of nausea, vomiting(clear, non-bilious, non bloody) , productive
cough (sputum color not noted), fatigue, and pain and redness of
his left foot.  He was found to have a draining wound
(approximately 1 cm in width x 1 cm in depth) on his left lower
leg, just superior to the lateral malleolus with an area of
surrounding cellulitis. He as admitted to the ED for IV
antibiotics and observation. In the ED 2 liters of IV fluid, a
dose of Vancomycin x1 (for cellulitis, first dose [**2149-2-22**]), and
a percocet and transferred to the MICU for further management.
In the MICU he was treated with his 5th liter of normal saline.
He was stable with a heart rate of  77 and a blood pressure of
140/66. Podiatry reported that plain film imaging showed
""interval osteolysis adjacent to the fixation screws that is
suggestive of infection or interval loosening"".  Blood and swab
cultures were obtained, and a urine culture was negative for
growth. He was then admitted to the medicine floor for further
management. On the floor He was continued on Vancomycin 1g [**Hospital1 **]
and started on Zosyn (Pip-tazo) 4.5g Q8H on [**2149-2-22**]. He also
developed a allergic reaction on his back, which appeared as
erythematous, non-raised target lesions. He was taken by
podiatry to the operating room on [**2149-2-24**] for surgical
debridement of his foot ulcer, and found to have an abscess that
was drained. Wound cultures grew Klebissela pneuomiae with
sensitivites to Cipro, Meropenum, Gent, ceftriaxone and less
sensitivities to Zosyn, amp/sublactam. He was continued on Vanc,
but the Zosyn was stopped and he was started on Cipro (500mg PO
bid) on [**2149-2-25**]. Wound cultures came back with gram positive
cocci, so he was started on Keflex PO 500mg qid (first dose
[**2149-2-26**].)Mr. [**Known lastname 24962**] improved with pain management after the
debridement, and underwent surgical closure on [**2149-3-3**] and was
discharged in good condition.
.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis:
The patient presented to the emergency department with a glucose
of 377, Anion Gap of  24, lactate of 1.2 and ketones in this
urine, consistent with Diabetic Ketoacidosis. Of note he also
had missed his previous 4 doses of lantus insulin.
He was given 6 units of insulin, 2 liters of IV fluid and
transferred to the MICU where he was started on an inslin drip.
His anion gap eventually close, he glucose was controlled in the
150-240's range, and his anion gap closed before he was admitted
to the medicine floor. On the medicine floor the patient was
followed by the [**Hospital **] clinic. His lantus dose was reduced to
half while he was NPO before procedures, and kept at 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
when eating regularly. His humalog scale was increased 2 units
during his stay because of increasing glucose levels. Upon
discharge his glucose was stable at 163 and his anion gap was
12.
.

3. Anemia: [**Known lastname 14611**] had a hematocrit of 27.3 on admission, with a
range of 24.4 to 28.3, with a discharge hematocrit of 26.7. Of
note, he loss 300cc of blood during  the surgical debridement of
his foot ulcer on [**2149-2-24**]. Two units of blood were cross and
matched, but a transfusion was not needed. He was mainted on
Iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, 325mg PO. His anemia
was stable at discharge.
.

4. Skin lesions: The patient has developed blanching, raised,
erythematous lesions with a target like appearance on his back
and neck in a similar distribution to a previous admission in
[**2148-10-12**]. Dermatology consulted on the patient, and a biopsy
was performed and found to be consistent with a drug reaction,
although erythema multiforme could not be excluded. The patient
was treated with HydrOXYzine 25 mg PO PRN/Q6H, and Sarna lotion
application PRN. The drug allergy improved over the course of
the admission and was stable at discharge. A follow up
appointment was made with the allergy clinic for the patient.

CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST

HISTORY: Sudden onset of severe headache.

Comparison is made with [**2124-11-1**].

There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical
infarction.
The ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size and
configuration. No bony
lesions are seen.

Impression: No evidence for mass or acute [**Month/Day/Year **]
.
MRA CHEST

CLINICAL INDICATION: A 45-year-old man with end-stage renal
disease on
hemodialysis, DM1, hypertension, and heart failure with severe
hypertension,
chest pain. Rule out aortic dissection.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted MR images were
acquired on a 1.5
Tesla magnet without the administration of intravenous
gadolinium.

COMPARISON EXAM: Chest radiograph on [**2125-2-5**].

FINDINGS:

Central vein catheter in place with tip in SVC.
The aorta is of normal caliber with no evidence of dissection,
intramural
hematoma, or atherosclerotic ulcer. No intraluminal filling
defects are seen.
The aorta measures 2.8 x 2.7 cm at the ascending portion, 2.5 cm
at the arch,
and 1.9 x 1.8 cm at the descending portion. The main pulmonary
artery is
enlarged and measures maximally to 3.0 cm.

There is cardiomegaly with enlargement of all four [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
Heart otherwise shows no gross abnormalities. No pericardial
effusion. No pleural effusions are evident. Decrease in size of
mediastinal lymphadenopathy that was seen on prior CT.
Mediastinal vasculature is otherwise unremarkable.

No abnormal marrow signal is evident. Soft tissues show no
abnormalities.
Pleural surfaces are clear. Visualized portions of the upper
abdomen show no abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of aortic dissection or acute aortic
abnormalities.

2. Cardiomegaly.

3. Enlarged main pulmonary artery which may be related to
pulmonary
hypertension, of which no causes are identified on this study.
.
STUDY: CT of the head without contrast.

HISTORY: A 45-year-old male with elevated blood pressure,
headache, and
vomiting. Assess for head [**Doctor Last Name **].

COMPARISONS: [**2125-2-5**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT images of the head were obtained
and displayed
in 5-mm axial reconstructions.

FINDINGS: This study is mildly degraded by patient motion. There
is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures,
hydrocephalus,or obvious large vascular territorial infarction.
Cavum septum pellucidum et vergae is noted and unchanged. The
density values of the brain parenchyma are maintained. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well
aerated. The soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable.

Moderate calcification involving the cavernous portions of the
carotid
arteries and the vertebral arteries, left greater than right,
are evident
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
EXAMINATION: Brain MRI.

HISTORY: 45-year-old male presents with severe headache.

COMPARISON: Head CTs [**2121-12-6**] through [**2125-2-6**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T2 FSE, T2, GRE, FLAIR, diffusion,
3D
time-of-flight MRA sequences through the brain were obtained.

FINDINGS: There are scattered periventricular and T2
hyperintensities within the bihemispheric white matter. There is
extensive T2 signal abnormality throughout the pons. There is no
acute infarct. Incidental note is made of a cavum septum
pellucidum and vergae.

MRA: The intracranial internal carotid arteries are normal, as
are the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. The posterior
circulation is normal. Minimal flow signal within the proximal
V3 segment of the left vertebral artery is likely artifactual.

IMPRESSION:
1. Scattered T2 hyperintensities throughout the bihemispheric
white matter
and more extensive confluent changes throughout the pons may be
secondary to severe microvascular ischemic disease in this
patient with a history of
chronic type 1 diabetes, end-stage renal disease on [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] and
poorly
controlled hypertension.

2. No intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformation or other
acute
abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo male h/o DMT1, ESRD, on HD, presenting with hypertensive
urgency/emergency in setting of worst headache of his life.

# Headache: Given history the concern was for intracranial [**Doctor Last Name **]
initially. Head CT was without bleeding, and Head MRI/MRA/MRV
was without bleeding or vascular malformation or venous
thrombosis. Patient initially refused LP. Since his headache
persisted for four days without resolution and reported left eye
blurriness, and left eye pain. Neurology was consulted and they
thought the pain may be from a migraine or a vascular phenomenon
and less likely intracranial [**Doctor Last Name **]. They recommended an LP to
rule out [**Doctor Last Name **] or infection given his vague symptoms. Fioricet
was started to treat his headache. On day 5 of his
hospitalziation, his headache resolved, however 24 hours later
his headache returned during [**Doctor Last Name 2286**]. Given the non-specific
headache, an LP was performed after patient ultimately
consented. First attempt at bedside was unsuccessful. He
eventually underwent an LP under fluoroscopic guidance at
interventional radiology with CSF only notable for a mildy
elevated opening pressure of 27 cm H2O. He notably had only 1
wbc, 0 rbcs, and negative culture, Cryptoccocal Ag, EBV and HSV
viral PCRs.

 The headache persistently had an unclear etiology. The leading
differential was vasospasm vs. migraine vs. HTN vs. ?HD related
(since it was more prominent on HD days). It was decided to
discontinue his nifedipine and start verapamil, as verapamil is
more vasoactive; this medication would help vasospasm, migraine,
and HTN etiology.  His headaches persisted despite these
interventions. Pain was consulted and felt that dilaudid may be
helpful. It was felt that an injection would not be helpful,
given the diffuse nature of his headaches. Fioricet was
discontinued, as it did not appear to be effective any more. He
was continued on full dose verapamil and dilaudid prn. His HTN
medication was aggressively uptitrated with the thought this
this would help his headaches. This moderately controlled his
headaches. He also had severe nausea and vomiting that was
controlled with reglan, compazine, and zofran, which was also
thought to help his headaches. He was given a trial of high flow
oxygen as well in case the etiology was cluster headache, but
this was not successful.

 Of note, the patient was felt to be quite sensitive to opiates
and benzos. On the day of his IR guided LP, he received 1 mg of
IV Ativan, which decreased his RR to 8 and he appeared very
sleepy. He also received 4 mg IV morphine to help control his
HA, but he also developed decreased RR to 8 and the same
sleepiness. He was not given these medications any more.

 Since the etiology of his headache was unclear, it was felt
that placing the patient on a regimen that he could take at home
would be the best for him, rather than IV dilaudid. Pain was
re-consulted. He was started on low dose MS-contin [**Hospital1 **] and 25 mg
topomax [**Hospital1 **]. Approximately 36 hours after these medications were
started the patient was completely somnolent and responsive to
sternal rub only. He was given Narcan 0.4 mg approximately three
times over the course of his somnolence and woke up briefly. He
remained in this state for nearly 72 hours. It was felt the
patient was on too much sedating medication causing this
deleterious effect. All opiates, topomax, and gabapentin were
all d/c'd. He was given an extra day of HD in hopes that this
would clear some of the medication that has built up in his
system. He remained hemodynamically stable and protected his
airway. These medications should be re-started only if
absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. He was not given
any more sedating medication and only given standing tylenol,
1000 mg q 8H. Surprisingly, tylenol by itself appeared to
control his headaches in the days leading up to discharge. He
was headache free in the last 24 hours of his admission.

It is truly unclear what the cause of his headaches are. It is
still speculated that HD may be the cause, as small studies have
demonstrated HD may cause headaches. It is unclear what the
treatment for this is. Also, HTN headaches did not show a clear
pattern, it is striking how when his blood pressure is ideally
controlled, his headaches have cleared. Nevertheless, his
headaches have resolved for the time being and further follow-up
with his PCP is in order.

# Hypertension: His hypertension was most pronounced on
hemodialysis days with SBPs in the 200s frequently.  As a
result, his antihypertensive regimen was aggressively increased.
 He began to take all of his anti-hypertensives everyday of the
week, including on HD days. He continued to have very high blood
pressures after this regimen. His BP medications were increased
to maximal doses. A clonidine patch was added at 0.1 mg q
weekly. He continued to have episodes of sbp to the 200s
occuring after [**Hospital1 2286**] in the setting of a severe headache. He
was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. His MICU
course was uneventful as his blood pressure decreased with IV
hydralazine x 1 and po labetalol, along with taking his BP
medications. He did not need an IV drip for blood pressure. He
was then started on Minoxidil 10 mg po BID. Near the end of his
hospitalization, his blood pressure was lower than expected with
levels in the low 100s. Minoxidil was decreased to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. It
was also noted that he was not wearing his clonidine patch for
several days in the setting of well controlled blood pressures.
After consultation with renal on the day of discharge, his
current regimen is as follows:
--Lisinopril 80 mg po daily (To be held the mornings prior to
HD)
--Valsartan 320 mg qhs
--Carvedilol 25 mg po BID
--Minoxidil 5 mg po BID (To be held the mornings prior to HD)
---Close follow up with his bp is highly recommended.

# Nausea/Vomiting: This was initially thought to be due to
gastroparesis, but a GES was performed which showed normal
motility. His N/V were felt to be secondary to his severe
headaches. His metoclopramide was continued, as was compazine
and zofran.   At times, despite these medications, he continued
to have nausea and vomiting. This proved quite difficult to
manage his blood pressure, as he would vomit his medication.
Once this was controlled, his blood pressure and headaches, and
eventually his nausea and vomiting improved. He was discharged
on metoclopramide 5 mg PO TID. Further evaluation of this
standing medication should be evaluated by his PCP at his next
visit.

# Cranial Nerve III Palsy: Diplopia was initially reported on
[**2-11**].  On further questioning the patient reports his symptoms
began on [**2-7**] after the ophtho exam.  Neuro initially evaluated
and feels likely third nerve palsy from diabetes.  LP negative
besides increased ICP of 27 mm Hg. Optho re-consulted [**2-18**] and
confirmed complete CN3 palsy as the cause of diplopia and
complete ptosis of left eye. It was felt that this may be
reversible, but if not, it can be surgically corrected. He will
follow up with Neuro-optho in the outpatient.

# DM1: continued home 75/25 plus HISS. He was given half his
standing dose when not tolerating PO.

# CKD: continued HD. Pt continued on sevelamer alone (phoslo
discontinued).

# Neuropathy: gabapentin was increased to TID initially, but
when patient became somnolent for several days, this medication
was discontinued. Of note, he was on a very high dose for HD
patients (300 mg TID). It was felt this may have contributed to
his somnolence. Caution should be made in the future if this
medication were to be re-started. He was continued on a
lidocaine patch for chronic left flank pain.

# Depression: During an episode of severe pain, the patient
stated he wanted to ""kill himself."" Since he has a history of
suicidal attempts, a 1:1 sitter was attempted. Through the
course of the day, growing concern that he would act on his
ideations by the sitter. Psychiatry was consulted and felt he
was not suicidal at this time, and the sitter was discontinued.
He was continued on citalopram. Social work actively consulted
the patient and helped him deal with his many social problems.
[**Name (NI) **] is to be followed with psychiatry in rehab.

# Low grade fever: A fever of 100.5 was noted during his
hospitalization. He was pan-cultured which was NGTD at time of
discharge. A chest x-ray did not show any acute finding. He was
not given antibiotics and his fevers resolved.

# Access: He had a right central line during this
hospitalization which was pulled prior to discharge. He has a
left AV fisula used for HD.

Discharge Diagnosis:
primary: Hypertensive emergency, Headache NOS
secondary: ESRD, DM1


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status:Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive
Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for headache and elevated blood
pressures. We were concerned that your headache might be from a
[**Hospital1 **] in your head but the ct scan of your head did not show any
bleeding. We asked for your permission to look at your
cerebrospinal fluid to confirm that you did not have a [**Hospital1 **] in
your head, but you initially refused. We told you that if we
miss [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in your head that could result in another larger
head [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] later, possibly even deadly, and you said you
understood this risk. We did check an MRI of your head to see if
we could see any blood vesels likely to [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and that showed
did not show a source of bleeding. Your headaches eventually
resolved after addition of fioricet, but then then returned in
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**].  A lumbar puncture was eventually performed by
interventional radiology and your CSF fluid was negative for
bleeding or infection.  Your nifedipine was also discontinued
and switched to verapimil to help your headache. Your headache
continued to persist. The pain service was consulted and a very
strong medication, Dilaudid was suggested. We stopped your
fiorcet as this did not appear to help your pain anymore, and
gave you dilaudid for your pain. This helped your headaches
mildly. We tried to change your pain medication to different
drugs (ms contin and low dose topomax), but this made you very
sleepy for several days. We stopped all of these medications
plus all strong sedating medications, such as dilaudid,
gabapentin, and ambien. You were continued on tylenol alone for
pain control, and surprisingly, this alleviated your headaches.
You are advised to not take these sedating medications any more
as it is very difficult for your body and kidneys to process
these medications. On the day of discharge, you were headache
free.

Your blood pressure was also very high during this hospital
stay. It appeared to be quite higher on your hemodialysis days.
We continued all of your medications on your [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**] days. We
also increased the dosage of several of your medications as well
as added new medications that are listed below. During your
hospital stay, you were briefly transferred to the intensive
care unit for closer evaluation of your elevated blood pressure.
You were monitored closely and your blood pressures decreased.
You were transferred back to the general floor. More blood
pressure medications were added and your blood pressure became
ideally controlled. Your new regimen is below.

You also developed double vision which we feel is secondary to a
nerve in your eye that is not working correctly caused by your
diabetes. This may reverse, but you may need surgery in the
future to correct this. You will be followed up by
Neuro-opthomology for further evaluation of this.

When you came in you also had chest pain, but we do not think
you had a heart attack.

You also had significant nausea and vomiting during your
hospital stay. We gave you strong medications to help this. You
eventually were able to tolerate food and medications. You will
be discharged on a home dose of an anti-nausea medication,
reglan.

When you go back to rehab, your new medications are as follows:

YOUR NEW BLOOD PRESSURE REGIMEN:
Verapamil 240 mg every 12 hours
Valsartan 320 mg every night
Lisinopril 80 mg daily
Minoxidil 5 mg twice a day
Clonidine patch 0.1 mg to be applied every saturday (keep on all
week)

PAIN CONTROL:
Lidocaine 5% patch, apply 12 hours on and 12 hours off as needed
for flank pain
Tylenol 1000 mg every eight hours for headache. Do not take more
than 4 grams of tylenol in 24 hours

STOP: Gabapentin (this may make you sleepy)
      Phoslo
      Glycopyrrolate

You are to contact your primary care doctor or go to the
emergency room if you experience severe headaches that are not
relieved with medication, sudden loss of vision or severe eye
pain, confusion, chest pain, or any other symptom that is
concerning to you.

RENAL U.S.

FINDINGS: The study is recent postop with extensive surgical
dressings, particularly over the left flank. The patient was
intubated and not able to comply with technologist's directions.

Limited imaging of the right kidney demonstrates a length of
approximately 10 cm. The echotexture is grossly unremarkable.
There is no hydronephrosis or stone identified. Visualization of
the left kidney was moderately compromised. The length is
approximately 9 cm. Again no gross hydronephrosis is seen. The
echotexture cannot be adequately evaluated. No stone is seen.
The patient was catheterized prior to arrival at Radiology. No
fluid is identified in the bladder. Despite multiple attempts,
visualization of the Foley catheter balloon was also not
possible.

IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study. Renal sizes are grossly
within normal limits and symmetric. No gross hydronephrosis is
identified. No stones are seen.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

Rotated heart secondary to COPD, limited and suboptimal
transesophageal and  transgastric views.  Normal LV systolic
function without any focal abnormalities. LV circumflex  area
during diastole started with 14cmsq and was same after the cross
clamp  came off.  No wall motion abnormalities detected at the
time of cross clamping of the  aorta that was suprarenal for
22min and then for another 40 minutes for  infrarenal clamp.
Echodense shadow seen in the descending thoracic aorta
consistent with aortic  stent no endoleak seen at the graft
sight. Mild to slightly moderate TR  The PA systolic pressure
estimated from TR equal to 40 mm of Hg that  correlates with the
PA systolic pressure tracing from the PA cath.  Propagation
velocity remained within the normal range before the cross clamp
 and after the cross clamp.

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
All four
pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. The IVC is
normal in diameter  with appropriate phasic respirator
variation.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D  images. Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity
size. Overall normal LVEF  (>55%). TVI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;  mid inferoseptal - normal; basal
inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal;  basal inferolateral -
normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral  -
normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -  normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex -
normal; apex - normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal  descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
Three aortic  valve leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**1-11**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:

The left atrium is normal in size. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium  or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size  are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).  The
calculated myocardial performance index was 0.34 (MPI A =528 ms;
MPI B = 394ms). Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)
suggesting increased  left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber  size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.  There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
mitral valve appears structurally  normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The transmitral flow propagation  velocity is 47c
m/s (nl <=0.45m/s) There is a small pericardial effusion.

Resume driving when you feel strong enough and comfortable
enough without needing pain medication .

No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for 8 weeks.

Avoid excessive bending at the hips and stooping for 4 weeks.

BATHING/SHOWERING:

You may shower immediately if the incision is dry upon coming
home. No baths until sutures / staples are removed. Dissolving
sutures may have been used. In either case, you can wash your
incision gently with soap and water.

WOUND CARE:

Suture / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are
not, an appointment will be made for you to return for staple
removal.

When the sutures / staples are removed the doctor may or may not
place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.
These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on.
If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off
with warm water and soap in the shower.

Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for
two weeks after surgery.

MEDICATIONS:

You may resume taking medication you were on prior to your
surgery unless specifically instructed otherwise by your
physician [**Name9 (PRE) **] will be given a new prescription for pain
medication, which should be taken every three (3) to four (4)
hours only if necessary.

Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small
balanced meals throughout the day.

CAUTIONS:

NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you
smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.

Avoid heavy lifting (over 20 pounds) for 8 weeks after surgery.

No strenuous activity for 4-6 weeks after surgery.

DIET:

There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent
meals may be preferred.

For people with vascular problems we would recommend a
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's
permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred
or get a referral from your doctor.

If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight
management program. Your health and its improvement depend on
it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be
easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new
attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get
a referral from your doctor.

If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may
request a referral from your doctor.

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:

Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your
improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the
chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood
pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to
the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!

Please call the office on the first working day after your
discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This
should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days
after discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5:30 Monday
through Friday.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE.


Followup Instructions:

Chief Complaint:
altered mental status; transfer from MICU

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation; now s/p extubation

History of Present Illness:
71M with multiple myeloma currently on Velcade, mixed
obstructive-restrictive lung disease, PAF, presented to the ED
on [**2167-8-29**] complaining of polyuria.  Per sister, patient has
been fatigued with poor po intake for several weeks. She is not
aware of any acute changes in his health. She took him to his
Velcade appointment on Friday, where he felt fatigued but was of
normal mood and behavior.  He received day 4 of his Velcade at
this time as well as 1u PRBCs.
.
His VS on presentation to the ED were T 99.6, HR 68, BP 106/56,
RR 25, O2sat 97% RA.  His K was 6.0, so he was given Kayexalate
30g. On exam, he had RUQ tenderness with a normal RUQ
ultrasound. He was also noted to be somewhat dyspneic with an
elevated D-dimer so he was sent for a V/Q scan to rule out a PE.
.
Halfway through the scan, he became agitated and combative and
had stool incontinence.  His VS upon return were HR 110, BP
144/65, O2sat 89% NRB. He was dyspneic, diaphoretic, and
nonverbal. He was given Ativan 1mg IV for agitation. On lung
exam, he had very poor air movement. He was intubated in the ED
for airway protection with altered mental status and hypoxic
respiratory failure. CXR showed clear lungs. He was given
Solumedrol 125mg IV, Benadryl 50mg IV, and Pepcid 20mg IV to
treat possible allergic reaction to the radionuclide material.
He was also started on a propofol gtt for sedation and 2L NS. He
was admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
In the MICU, he was quickly weaned off of the ventilator and on
to a nasal cannula at 2L/min on the morning of [**2167-8-31**].  His
mental status remained somewhat impaired in that he was never
fully oriented to place.  He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent
(though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+)
cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on
vancomycin.  His sputum culture also had 4+ gram(+) cocci in
pairs/chains.  His warfarin was initially held due to the
possibility of an LP but this was never done since his mental
status seemed to be improving.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**12/2164**] after presenting with
several months of diffuse bony pain; found to have numerous
lytic bony lesions and a monocloncal kappa protein in his UPEP
(>8 grams of kappa proteinuria); diagnosed with stage IIIB kappa
light chain multiple myeloma.  He initially responded well to
Decadron and was then intolerant to thalidomide/Decadron; he
subsequently responded well to Cytoxan/Decadron with a marked
decrease in his kappa excretion and improvement inhis renal
function.  In [**7-/2165**], he underwent an autologous SCT after
treatment with high-dose melphalan.  He went into remission at
this time which he maintained until [**7-/2167**] when he presented to
the ED with dyspnea on exertion; he was found to have 20 grams
of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria and new diabetes insipidus.  A bone
marrow biopsy showed >60% plasma cells.  He was pulsed with
Decadron and discharged on po Decadron for his MM and intranasal
ddAVP for his DI.  On [**2167-8-25**], he was started on Velcade (in
addition to his [**Hospital1 **] Decadron).  He received days 1 and 4 of
Velcade prior to this presentation.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU, he was quickly weaned off of the ventilator and on
to a nasal cannula at 2L/min on the morning of [**2167-8-31**].  His
mental status remained somewhat impaired in that he was never
fully oriented to place.  He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent
(though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+)
cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on

pairs/chains.  His warfarin was initially held due to the
possibility of an LP but this was never done since his mental
status seemed to be improving.
.
Upon transfer to the floor:
.
A/P: 71M with multiple myeloma, mixed obstructive-restrictive
lung disease, ? DI, and PAF, admitted after acute episode of
altered mental status (of unclear etiology) now extubated and
transferred out of the MICU. Gram (+) cocci growing from blood.
.
## ID:
- [**1-24**] blood culture bottles from admission grew vanc-sensitive
coag negative Staph; he completed a 10-day course of IV
vancomycin and remained afebrile
- sputum culture grew non-Pseudomonas gram negative rods (CXR
normal); completed course of levofloxacin
- ceftriaxone was added for 3 days ([**Date range (1) 18881**]) due to concern
for meningitis with his second change in mental status (see
below) and was stopped once mental status returned to baseline
and it became clear there was no meningitis
.
# Mental status change:
-On the night of [**9-3**], the patient became acutely psychotic and
agitated.  He was very worried that people were smoking crack in
the halls and that there were people trying to hurt the nurses
and sabotage Dr[**Name (NI) 6168**] practice.   His warfarin and steroids
were stopped at this time. A psych consult was obtained the next
morning who recommended Haldol/Cogentin.  He required sedation
with Haldol/Ativan/Dilaudid to get a head CT (which was negative
for a bleed).  Following sedation, the next evening, he was
noted to be very rigid and received an additional dose of
Cogentin.  A neuro consult was obtained the next day who
recommended stopping Haldol due to the rigidity.  Per neuro
consult, an LP was attempted twice to rule out CNS infection,
but the patient was too agitated; he was treated empirically
with vanco/ceftriaxone until it was clear that there was no
meningitis; he had a persistently non-focal neuro exam with no
menigeal signs.  An EEG showed nonspecific slowing consistent
with his sedation.  Infectious workup (CXRs, cultures) remained
negative and he remained afebrile.  His mental status slowly
returned to baseline overnight on [**2171-9-6**], presumably as the
effects of the steorids wore off.  He was taken off of 1:1
observation and remained calm and cooperative.  Further
psychoactive meds (except for pain control meds) were held.
.
## Multiple myeloma: Currently on Velcade, last dose 10/6, and
dexamethasone.
- he was continued on his outpatient dexamethasone regimen (8mg
po bid) but this was stopped on [**9-6**] when he developed
psychosis; there were some indications that he might not have
been taking this at home, and his self-limited psychosis was
thought to be secondary to the steroids
.
## ?DI/endocrine:
- during previous admission there was a reported history of
diabetes insipidus; a water deprivation test was done during
that admission, though endocrine did not see the patient.
Endocrine was consulted this time and recommended a pituitary
MRI which showed a lack of expected hyperintensity in the
neurohypophysis.  No water deprivatino test was done, though his
ddAVP was stopped when he became psychotic and his sodium
remained normal with normal urine output.  Per endo, he does not
need to be on ddAVP.  Also noted were low TSH, T4, T3, fT4
levels.  A rT3 was slightly high and endocrine recommended
repeat thyroid functino tests in [**12-26**] weeks (suspect sick
euthyroid) for follow-up with no thyroid replacement at this
time.

.
## Obstructive/restrictive lung disease: Unclear etiology. MRI
chest showed no PE and PA hypertension
- continued Advair
- weaned off of O2 as tolerated
.
## PAF: Currently rate-controlled.
- cont metoprolol and short-acting diltiazem for rate control
- warfarin was stopped due to mental status changes; with his
continued gait instability, it was deemed too unsafe for him to
continue warfarin, especially since he was not in AFib at all
during the admisison
.
## Endocrine
- dexamethasone as above
- TSH, T4, fT4 all low; ?sick euthyroid
.
## Hypertension:
- continued on his metoprolol and diltiazem
.
## FEN: Poor po intake x weeks per sister; NPO in MICU
- 500cc NS bolus then NS at 125cc/hr; check fluid status closely
- daily lytes; watch for rising sodium
- dysphagia diet, thickened liquids; may need speech/swallow
eval
.
## Code status: with his psychosis, he was made DNR/DNI by his
sister (due to his advanced myeloma) when he did not have
capacity to make medical decisions
.
## Communication: sister [**Name (NI) 18882**] [**Name (NI) 634**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 18883**]
.
## Dispo: pt is deconditioned and unsteady on his feet and, per

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary diagnosis: change in mental status, multiple myeloma,
steroid psychosis

Secondary diagnosis: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
hypertension, osteoarthritis s/p bilateral knee replacements,
restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease


Discharge Condition:
stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after an acute change in your
mental status which required intubation in order to protect your
airway.  After you were extubated, you were sent from the
intensive care unit to the floor.  While on the floor, you again
had an abrupt change in your mental status where you were
hallucinating and feeling very paranoid; it is thought that this
was due to your high steroid dose which has since been stopped.
Your warfarin (Coumadin) has been stopped due to bleeding risks.
 Your intranasal ddAVP was stopped since we do not believe that
you need it.  You are being discharged to a rehab facility so
that you may regain your strength.

Please attend all follow-up appointments.  Please take all
medications as prescribed.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 50 year old man with HIV on HAART (CD4 count of
589 [**2104-9-24**]) and CAD who presented to the ED with nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, fevers, chills, pruritis and
abdominal pain. Patient had a dental visit today and took
antibiotic prophylaxis (amoxicillin). Shortly after, he
developed symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills.


In the ED his initial temperature was 98.7 with HR of 102, BP
91/61, O2 sat 97% RA. Abdominal CT showed no diverticulitis or
appendicitis. While in the ED he developed a temperature of
102.2 with HR of 110, BP 84/47, O2 sat 100%. Lactate was 4.9.
Patient received ceftriaxone 2 gm, vancomycin and flagyl. After
4 liters of normal saline his BP was 86/63, temp 100.4, HR 107.
He had several episodes of watery diarrhea. LP was performed
which showed no signs of infection. He was started on the sepsis
protocol and received a total of 6L of NS with 1000 cc of urine
output. Patient was started on levophed and it was titrated to
0.05 mcg/kg/min for a bp of 90/42 with a MAP 59. CVP was 9, SVO2
83%.

In the ICU, he initially required pressors to maintain his blood
pressure but his hemodynamics quickly stabilized so that he did
not require pressors or IV fluids.  On [**10-19**] he was afebrile
with stable vitals on po levofloxacin and he was transferred to
the medical floor.  On transfer he endorsed continued fatigue
and nausea but felt subjectively much better and specifically
denied fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal
pain, or dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 50 year old man with HIV, CAD, and HTN who
presented with nausea, vomting, diarrhea, weakness, fevers,
chills, pruritis and abdominal pain. He initially required
pressors and IV fluids to support his blood pressure.

1) SIRS:
His presentation with fever, tachycardia, hypotension and an
elevated lactate was thought to be consistent with SIRS.  The
etiology of his SIRS was unclear as his infectious workup was
largely negative with the exception of a potential LLL
pneumonia.  It was thought that this was most likely due to an
anaphylactic reaction to amoxicillin as on further questioning
he endorsed pruritis, facial erythema/edema, and that these
symptoms felt quite similar to an anaphylactic exposure to
bactrim he had several years ago.  Regardless of the etiology he
quickly improved in terms of hemodynamics and lactate level.  He
was continued on levofloxacin and given a prescription to
complete a seven day course to finish on [**2104-10-23**].

2) Abdominal pain/diarrhea/vomiting:
This was thought to be part of his SIRS process and generally
improved during his hospitalization.  A CT scan was negative for
an infectious or inflammatory process.  He still complained of
slight nausea at discharge and was given a prescription for
compazine to use as needed.

3) HIV: He was continued on his HAART regimena and will follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

4) CAD/HTN:
His anti-hypertensives were initially held due to his
hypotension.  At discharge his blood pressure was stable in the
110-150/50-80 range.  At discharge he was restarted on atenolol
at 25 mg daily.  He has a follow-up appointment in [**Company 191**] on
[**2104-9-22**] and at this time he should have his blood pressure
checked and medications adjusted if needed (he was previously
taking metoprolol 50 mg and lisinopril 5 mg).  He was continued
on his aspirin.

5) Hyperlipidemia:
He was restarted on his pravastatin at discharge.

History of Present Illness:
40 yo M with in his usual state of good health presents with
fever to 103, cough, and shortness of breath. His initial
symptoms were fever and myalgia, beginning abruptly on Friday
morning. He subsequently developed cough. On the morning of his
admission, he developed palpitations and presented to a hospital
in [**Location 3615**], where he was found to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation. From there, he was transported to [**Location (un) 9101**], where
he was treated with normal saline, vancomycin 1 gm, azithromycin
500 mg, ceftriaxone 1 gram, digoxin 0.25 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg,
acetaminophen 975 mg, diltiazem 20 mg IV, and Cardizen CD 120
mg. His heart rate was controlled, but he developed a new oxygen
requirement and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

At [**Hospital1 18**], CXR showed a right-sided pneumonia with parapneumonic
effusion. He was continued on a diltiazem gtt at 10 mg/hr. Blood
and sputum cultures were sent. He was admitted to the ICU on a
non-rebreather.

DISCHARGE LABS:

Imaging:
[**7-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia and possible right pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to atelectasis
although a second location of consolidation/infection not
excluded. Additionally, subtle opacity at the lateral left mid
lung, while could relate to overlying soft tissue, additional
focus of consolidation is not excluded.

[**7-7**]: CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion is stable. On
the left, an area of
parenchymal opacity, previously qualified as potential
pneumonia, has
increased in extent. There is a newly occurred small reactive
left-sided
pleural effusion with subsequent left atelectasis. The diameter
of the
pulmonary vessels is minimally increased, potentially reflecting
mild fluid overload.

[**7-7**] CTA: 1. Widespread rapidly evolving multilobar pneumonia,
possibly complicated by ARDS.
2. Small bilateral simple layering pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
40 yo M presents with fever, shortness of breath, and cough,
admitted to MICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB, found to have
trilobar PNA.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:
# Multilobar Pneumonia, likely bacterial: CTA results showed
significant tri-lobar PNA which appeared significant enough for
shunting to explain his degree of hypoxia. His PNA was treated
and oxygen was weaned down and he tolerated walking around floor
with nasal cannula, though he wore face tent at baseline for
comfort. He was initially treated for CAP but because he works
in a health-care setting and considering the extent of PNA with
hypoxia he was treated for HCAP coverage with IV vancomycin,
cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. On the floor he quickly weaned down
to room air and was breathing comfortably with occasionally
sputum tinged with blood. He was discharged on a 10-day course
of levofloxacin & linezolid, to cover ensure coverage of both
MSRA and other usual CAP organisms.

#Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Dr. [**Known lastname 23**] initially presented
in new onset A.Fib with runs of RVR into 160s with associated
hypotension. He was treated with a 10mg/hr Dilt drip and
spontaneously converted to sinus and he remained in sinus rhythm
throughout the rest of his hospitalization. Although he has a
history of palpitations in the past (and has been on a Holter
monitor), this is his first episode of atrial fibrillation.
Given his CHADS2 score of 0-1 it was felt that he did not
require anything other than a daily aspirin (which he has been
taking as an outpatient).  The aspirin was held due to
intermittent hemoptysis/blood streaked sputum, but Dr. [**Known lastname 23**]
was advised to discuss reinitiation of aspirin as an outpatient.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: None.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Follow-Up: The patient was instructed to follow up with his
new primary care doctor within 1-2 weeks.  He was told to
discuss reinitation of aspirin with his PCP when his hemoptysis
ceases.  He should also be screened for hypertension, as it was
noted that his blood pressure was elevated to the 140s-150s
systolic while he was on the floor.

She describes her baseline at chronic stable angina with chest
pressure at similar level of exertion such as walking [**5-17**] block
of level ground. However over the past month she noted a
decreased threshhold for her discomfort now after only 1 flight
of stairs. On the day prior to her admission she had the similar
sensation of chest pressure while at rest. It lasted for ~2
hours and improved with nitroglycerin. She had recurrent event
at 1:30pm on the 25th so she presented to the hospital. She
states her weight has been stable. She has chronic venous stasis
and has had new lower extremity swelling over the past few
weeks. She has no orthopnea or PND.

.
On floor, patient was feeling short of breath with walking to
the bathroom but otherwise feeling well. She has no current
chest pain.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools. She has been having small amount of blood on the toilet
tissue over the past few weeks. She denies recent fevers, chills
or rigors. She has exertional leg pain at 4 blocks of walking.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

STUDIES OF RELEVANCE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER:

[**2167-4-9**] CXR:
Lungs clear, mild pulmonary engorgement and top normal heart
size suggest
borderline cardiac decompensation, but there is no edema or
appreciable
pleural effusion.

[**2167-4-10**] Card Cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had a proximal <50% stenosis.
--the LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the RCA had an ostial >90% stenosis.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated
left-sided
filling pressures, with LVEDP 30 mmHg.  There was mild systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with SBP 149 mmHg.  There was no gradient
across
the aortic valve upon pullback of the angled pigtail catheter
from LV to
ascending aorta.
3.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with two
overlapping
bare metal stents - Minivision (2.5x15mm distally; 2.5x12mm
proximally)
postdilated with a 2.75mm balloon. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III
flow throughout the vesel (See PTCA comments).
4.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a 6F
Angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Significant one coronary artery disease.
2.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with two
overlapping
bare metal stents.
3.  Successful clousre of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a 6F
Angioseal closure device.

[**2167-4-11**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild basal and mid-anterior septal
hypokinesis, distal septal akinesis and probable apical
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40-45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericar
dial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal right ventricular systolic function. Mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

[**2167-4-11**]:
IMPRESSION: CT A and P
1. Multifocal consolidations may represent pneumonia, however
pulmonary
hemorrhage in the setting of hyperdense, and likely hemorrhagic,
effusions
should be considered.
2. Retained renal contrast with vicarious excretion via the
gallbladder, all
consistent with renal failure.
3. Fibroid uterus.

[**2167-4-13**] CT Chest:
Followup of a patient with bilateral pleural
effusion, consolidations, and known pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen from [**2167-4-11**] and multiple chest
radiographs
obtained in the interval between [**4-9**] and [**2167-4-13**].

TECHNIQUE: Unenhanced MDCT of the chest was obtained from
thoracic inlet to upper abdomen with subsequent 1.25- and 5-mm
collimation axial images reviewed in conjunction with coronal
and sagittal reformats.

FINDINGS:
Extensive widespread consolidations involve mostly the right
upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe but also are
seen in left lower lobe and left apex. The consolidations are
relatively high in density (the left upper lobe consolidation is
about 57 Hounsfield units in density), as are the right middle
lobe and lower lobe consolidations (ranging up to 50 Hounsfield
units). The comparison of the lung bases with a recent CT
abdomen from [**2167-4-3**] demonstrates interval progression
of the consolidations in the right middle and right lower lobe.
The bilateral pleural effusion, although did not increase
significantly in size, is still of high density (up to 46
Hounsfield units) in the lower portions of the lungs suggesting
sedimentation effect.

The mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged ranging up to 16 mm in
right lower paratracheal area and might be reactive. Extensive
coronary calcifications are noted. The heart size is mildly
enlarged. There is no significant pericardial effusion.

Minimal left pneumothorax is demonstrated, 2A:31, seen in the
anterior
mediastinum giving the patient's supine position and might
correspond to an apical pneumothorax demonstrated on the upright
chest radiograph obtained the same day earlier at 09:09 a.m.
Although the comparison between the chest CT and chest
radiograph is difficult, the size of the pneumothorax is most
likely unchanged and is small.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates fat density
left adrenal lesion, -19 Hounsfield units, consistent with
lipoma. The rest is
unremarkable within the limitations of this non-enhanced study.
Again note is made of the presence of contrast enhancement of
the kidneys consistent with known failure and retained excretion
of contrast. Contrast is also
demonstrated in the renal pelvis. The vicarious excretion of the
distended
gallbladder is again noted. The bladder is at least 5 cm in
diameter,
although no wall thickening or surrounding abnormalities are
seen.

There are no [**Year (4 digits) 500**] lesions worrisome for malignancy. Degenerative
changes are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral consolidations, right more than left, of
high density that might be consistent with multifocal
hemorrhage. The differential diagnosis in the presence of renal
failure might include vasculitis. Hemorrhagic pneumonia might be
considered in appropriate clinical setup.
2. Small left apical pneumothorax, most likely unchanged
compared to prior
chest radiograph.
3. Bilateral grossly unchanged pleural effusions, high in
density that might also contain an element of hemorrhage.
4. Extensive coronary calcifications.
5. Still present contrast enhancement of kidneys and vicarious
excretion of contrast the gallbladder consistent with known
renal failure.




Brief Hospital Course:
85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease s/p
BMS x 2 in RCA on [**2167-4-10**], with post-cath course complicated by
pulmonary edema, contrast-induced nephropathy requiring CCU stay
with transition to cardiac service.

1) Unstable angina/CAD: Patient's typical anginal pain was
occurring at rest and had ST depressions in V4-6. Given concern
for ongoing bleeding cath was deferred until [**4-10**]. Cardiac
catheterization demonstrated 90% occlusion of ostial RCA which
was stented with two overlapping bare metal stents. Her chest
pain occurred intermittently since the PCI with intermittent ST
depressions in V4-V6. Nitro gtt was temporarily started for the
pain, and she remained pain free after it was discontinued.
Cardiac markers were mildly elevated, likely demand ischemia
from anemia, and CK-MB was negative. She was treated with
aspirin, statin, and plavix. Patient's metoprolol was restarted
once she stabilized.

2) Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Felt to be
secondary to RBC transfusions at OSH. She had an ongoing O2
requirement and desatted to 85% RA on am of [**4-11**], for which she
was transferred to the CCU and lasix gtt was started. Fluid was
initially removed via CVVH (as below), although once UOP
improved, she was successfully diuresed with IV furosemide.

3) Acute on chronic CKD: FENa 6%, likely contrast nephropathy.
Her [**Last Name (un) **] was held. Renal was consulted for poor UOP while on
lasix drip and high dose diuril. Her creatinine rose and she was
started on CVVH via L IJ line. After a few days, her UOP picked
up and responded well to 40mg IV furosemide boluses, so the CVVH
line was removed.

4) Anemia: Given concern for RP bleed related to cath, she had
CT abd, which showed bilat ?hemothoraces, but no RP bleed. Other
source could be GI bleed from external hemorrhoids. She received
1 unit of pRBCs and her hematocrit remained stable.

5) Pneumonia: Patient had frequent coughing associated with
desaturations. CT chest was concerning for atypical pneumonia
vs. alveolar hemorrhage, although pulm consult favored the
former. ANCA and anti-GBM were negative. She received a 5 day
course of azithromycin and a brief course of prednisone for
possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (one day each at 60mg,
40mg, 20mg, 10mg). Her cough greatly improved.

6) Diabetes mellitus: Initially on glargine, although changed to
insulin gtt in the CCU due to highly elevated (300s) sugars in
the setting of steroids. She was transitioned back to glargine
as the steroids were rapidly tapered.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2146-5-16**] where the patient underwent CABG x 3
as detailed in the operative report.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis, given the preoperative LOS of greater
than 24 hours.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  By POD 2 the patient was
hemodynamically stable, weaned from vasopressor/inotropic
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without incident.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 85298**] was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
evaluation of her strength and mobility.  By the time of
discharge on POD five the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was cleared by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge to home on
POD# five.  All follow up appointments were advised.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 5239**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU [**2190-5-21**] upon arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**]. He was already intubated. His ICU course was dominated by
respiratory failure and inability to wean from ventilator. It
was felt he had an aspiration event, and that aspiration
pneumonitis was the primary cause of the respiratory failure.
Initially, he required muscular paralysis to maintain ventilator
mechanics, this was weaned off within 48 hours. He continued to
be hypoxic when attempting to wean him from CMV to CPAP, and CXR
showed possible infiltrate, so he was bronched and started on
empiric antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia. He
continued to spike fevers daily until HD 4. When his BAL results
came back as streptococcus pneumoniae, his antibiotics were
briefly narrowed to ceftriaxone monotherapy, then re-broadened
to Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl per the recommendation of an Infectious
Disease consult. To further assist in weaning him from the
ventilator, a lasix drip was begun HD 3 and run for 2 days with
good diuresis. By HD 4, he was transitioned to CPAP and
breathing well on his own mechanics. Also this day, he displayed
groin and back erythema, thought to be a combination of fungal
infection and drug reaction. On HD 5 he was weaned from propofol
and versed to Precedex while simultaneously weaning his PEEP
requirements. He was eventually extubated HD 6 and transferred
to the floor.  Also of note durinig his ICU course: He was
evaluated on CIWA scales but did not score significantly. He had
diarrhea while in the ICU, C.Dif was negative, resolved with
fiber. He was maintained on prophylaxis while in the ICU:
Heparin sub-cu, famotidine, VAP bundle.  He had a left
subclavian central line placed on [**2190-5-21**].

Floor course:
On [**2190-5-26**] he was transferred to the floor. His fever curve was
monitored and trended downward.  His CVL was removed on [**5-26**] and
cultured with no growth. By [**5-27**] he remained afebrile. However,
he was noted to have a rising WBC count to 12 and then 16.9
(from 5.5). His chest xray on [**5-28**] showed no evidence of
pneumonia and he was without cough or sputum. He was weaned off
the oxygen with good oxygen saturation on room air. All
antibiotics were discontinued at this point. Blood test showed
elevated lipase to >800. RUQ US showed hepatic steatosis.
Gastroenterology was consulted and felt this was likely due to
alcoholic pancreatitis. Patient will follow-up in their clinic
for this.

Otherwise he remained hemodynamically stable.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluated him.
Occupational therapy recommended outpatient follow-up with
cognitive neurology.
Patient was discharged and would like to go on voluntary
admission to an alcohol rehab treatment facility.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 yo woman with hx of non-small cell lung
cancer who was transfered from OSH with bilateral PEs. For full
HPI please see admission note. Briefly, she had last received
taxol, carboplatin, on [**2188-10-20**].She had rcvd avastin as well on
prior cycles but held due to poorly controlled BP. The patient
was at home when she noted acute worsening of chronic dyspnea
and came to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] where she was diagnosed with bilateral
PEs. She was started on heparin gtt and bedside ECHO showed RV
strain, but patient remained hemodynamically stable while in
ICU. She was transitioned to lovenox and called out to the
floor.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
======================
Adapted from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3279**] notes:
This patient is a former heavy smoker, although quit over 20
years ago. Developed left arm pain down in [**State 108**] late in the
spring of [**2186**]. She was evaluated for this, which included a CT
scan of the chest, which indicated a right middle lobe lung
lesion. She came back to [**Location (un) 86**] and underwent a right middle
lobectomy at [**Hospital6 **] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
She had a stage I T1 N0 2.6-cm moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma resected by right middle lobectomy at [**Hospital 2082**] [**2186-7-11**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. There was no vascular
lymphatic invasion. Margins were negative. Multiple lymph nodes
were sampled and were negative. She also had a mediastinoscopy
preoperatively with multiple N2 and N3 lymph nodes that were
negative. Over the next year, she had an increasing right lower
lung nodule. She underwent a CT-guided needle biopsy on [**2187-7-31**].
This was a 1.2-cm right lower lobe nodule. The report was
positive for malignancy changes consistent with non-small cell
carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma. Finally, she did have an MRI of
her brain done at [**Hospital6 **] on [**2188-6-26**]. This
showed some mild chronic
microvascular changes but no evidence of tumor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
====================
- Non- small cell Lung cancer, adenocarcinoma as above.
- Allergic rhinitis.
- Hypertension.
- Hyperlipidemia.
- Gastroesophaeal reflux disease.
- Esophageal stricture, status post-dilation.
- Status post-total hip replacements and one knee replacement
for osteoarthritis.

Social History:
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 79529**] note:
She is married and lives with her husband. They winter in
[**State 108**] and they live up here the rest of the time. She does not
work anymore, but used to work as an assistant to a thoracic
surgeon at the [**Location 1268**] VA. She does not drink any alcohol.
She smoked one pack a day for 30-years, but quit in [**2162**].


Family History:
There is no family history of any lung disease. Her brother had
some type of cancer, which was either a thyroid cancer or throat
cancer, the patient is not sure.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
Floor course 1:
Pt was initially admitted to the floor service for further care
of a COPD exacerbation. On the evening of admission ([**10-21**]), pt
had an episode of [**7-9**] left sided CP with concurrent SOB that
improved with SL NTG. Pt's troponin and CK were subsequently
positive (0.13 and 162) and EKG had lateral ST depressions so he
was started on a heparin drip. A cardiology consult was obtained
on [**10-21**] and further medical management was initially presued.
On the evening of HD #1, the pt developed acutely worsening SOB
with tachypnia to the 40s. ABG showed 7.24/57/222 so he was
transferred to the MICU for management of hypercarbic
respiratory failure including noninvasive ventilation.
.
MICU course:
In the MICU, pt's respiratory status improved with noninvasive
ventilation, continuous nebs, IV steroids, and lasix. Anxiety
related SOB was also been an issue for which pt received
klonipin. Pt continued to be followed by cardiology for his
NSTEMI and had a peak troponin of 0.21 at 10:46 PM on [**10-21**].
Echo was done on [**10-22**] showing a LVEF of 40 to 45% with severe
AS. Pt continued to have severe respiratory distress requiring
continuous BIPAP and persistent troponin elevation thought to
bue due to secondary demand ischemia. A cardiac cath was not
obtained as it would have required intubation which the pt did
not desire. TPN was started for nutritional support on [**10-24**]. Pt
was weaned off of noninvasive ventilation on the evening of
[**10-26**] and has been having an oxygen sat of 100% on 6L NC. He was
also started on an insulin drip on [**10-26**] secondary to
persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Insulin drip was
weaned off prior to being transferred to the floor for further
care; pt was continued on NPH and insulin sliding scale.
.
Floor course 2:
.
1. Respiratory- On the floor, pt continued to have good O2
saturations ranging from 97-100% on 1-2Lnc. Pt was continued to
be aggressively treated for COPD with standing and prn albuterol
nebs, atrovent nebs, montelukast, azithromycin, and steroid
taper. Pt was seen by pulmonary consult. From their
recommendations, we discontinued atrovent and started spiriva.
We also switched from azithromycin to bactrim. Azithromycin has
anti-inflammatory properties, but there is still little good
evidence for its benefit in COPD. Pulmonary felt that Bactrim
would be a better antibiotic, in the the setting of long-term
steroids since it has PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 21150**]. Advair was added the the
regimen. Prednisone taper was continued. The taper is to be as
follows: Prednisone 50 x 7 days, 40mg x 7 days, 30mg x 7days,
then continue with 20mg. Klonipin which was given for anxiety
was discontinued secondary to lethargy. Pt will follow-up with
outpatient pulmonologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known firstname **].
.
2. CAD/[**Name (NI) 102410**] Pt had a NSTEMI on [**10-21**] which was felt to be
most probably due to demand but acute coronary syndrome could
not be absolutely excluded. He was on heparin for 5 days and was
d/c'ed in setting of left subconjunctival hemorrhage. Since pt
is just recovering from his COPD exacerbation, we felt that it
would be safer to defer cardiac cath as an outpatient. Pt agreed
with this plan and stated his wish not to be cath'ed during this
admission. Cardiology was okay with this plan and they plan to
re-evaluate him in 4 weeks. In the meantime, pt was continued on
with medical management. He was continued on diltiazem for rate
control (beta blocker not used in order to avoid it's
bronchospastic effects). However, diltiazem was unable to be
titrated up secondary to blood pressure intolerance; pt's HR
remained in 90-110 range. Pt was continued on captopril, but
most doses were held secondary to blood pressure intolerance.
For now, we will discontinue ACEi; please add it back on as
tolerated. Pt was continued on aspirin and statin.
.
3. Severe aortic stenosis- Pt found to have severe aortic
stenosis on echo during this admission. The plan to be have
cardiac cath as an outpatient after pulmonary rehab for a formal
assessment of the aortic valve. We avoided beta blocker and
nitoglycerin.
.
4. Steroid induced diabetes mellitus- Pt was continued on NPH
and sliding scale. Oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] glipizide was added. Pt is on
Metformin as an outpatient, but we did not restart that since pt
may be at increased risk for lactic acidosis in the setting of
hypoxia or cardiac ischemia. Please continue to titrate up
glipizide and adjust NPH as indicated.
.
5. [**Name (NI) 12329**] Pt had a difficult time tolerating diltiazem and ACEi
given his low blood pressures ranging from 90-100 systolic. We
will continue diltiazem for rate control and hold ACEi for now.
Please titrate up dilt for better rate control. If BP tolerates,
can consider restarting ACEi
.
6. Subconjunctival hemorrhage- Occurred in setting of IV heparin
and noninvasive positive pressure. There was slow resolution of
the hemorrhage. Pt was continued on erythromycin ointment qid.
Ophtho stated that it may take 2 weeks for the hemorrhage to
resolve. After then, pt should be safe for elective cardiac
cath. Should anti-coagulation be urgently indicated prior to
resolution of hemorrhage, ophtho feels the hemorrhage should not
be an absolute contraindication. Pt will f/u with [**Hospital **] clinic
one week after discharge.
.
7. [**Name (NI) 14983**] Pt was continued on PPI.
.

8. Crohn's disease- Stable Pt was continued on mesalamine DR.
.
9. FEN- Was on TPN in MICU which was discontinued. Pt was
continued on cardiac, [**Doctor First Name **] diet.

CXR [**2193-7-27**]
IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacities in the right upper and
lower lobes, concerning for active infection. With evidence
suggestive of prior TB, current active TB infection is not
excluded.

CT CHEST [**2193-7-28**]
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Peribronchovascular opacities in the right upper and middle
lobes most
suggestive of bronchopneumonia. Given history of TB and a partly
calcified
mass in the right upper lobe which could represent a large
granuloma, active tuberculosis is an important differential
consideration. Hemorrhage is another consideration.

2. Calcified nodule in the right lung (20 x 10 mm), probably
sequela of prior infection versus a tumor. CT follow-up is
recommended to resolution of opacities and surveillance of the
lung nodule within three months. If
available, comparison to prior studies could also be helpful.
PET scanning
could also be considered once the more acute process has
resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED with a chief complaint of hemoptysis

# Hemoptysis - Chest film demonstrated multifocal opacities in
the RUL and RLL. Given the patient's prior history of TB and the
inability to exclude this on presentation, he was admitted to a
negative-pressure room.  On the floor, he remained
hemodynamically stable. He had three negative AFBs and was
removed from respiratory precautions. He had a CT scan on [**7-28**]
which showed peribronchovascular opacities and a 1cm x 2cm right
lung nodule felt to be chronic granuloma/prior infection
sequelae vs. malignancy. On [**7-29**], he again had moderate
hemoptysis and reportedly vomited blood and had black stools.
Pulmonary was consulted, and he was started on
Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin empirically for CAP on [**2193-7-31**].

Durnig his course, he had a recurrence of massive hemoptysis.
He was bronched on [**8-1**] and found to have substantial bleeding
from the posterior segment of right upper lobe. He then went to
IR and had embolization of the right bronchial artery and right
upper intercostal arterial branch. After the procedure, he was
intubated with a dual-lumen endotracheal tube to prevent
extravasation of blood into the left lung if bleeding recurred.
He remained stable and was extubated on [**8-2**]. Ceftriaxone was
replaced with Cefpodoxime on [**8-3**]. His pulmonary hemorrhage was
attributed to inflammation of prior eroded tissue from old TB,
with a new pneumonia as the precipitant.

# Elevated creatinine - He also had mild renal insufficiency
which was likely secondary to contrast nephropathy after the IR
procedure. The patient was transferred to the medical floor on
[**2193-8-3**], and his creatinine normalized with IV fluids and time.

He demonstrated continued clinical improvement, with small
amount of hemoptysis post-procedure.  He remained afebrile with
normal vital signs after transfer from the ICU.  He was
discharged on [**2193-8-4**] and will complete a 7 day course of both
azithromycin and cefpodoxime, to be completed on [**2193-8-6**].  He
will schedule a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the week of discharge.

No other medications were started.

The patient is a full code.

Preliminary Report:
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2100-9-22**]
CONCLUSION:
1. Moderate-to-severe circumferential pericardial effusion is
nonhemorrhagic. This study is not tailored to rule out
tamponade. However, we do not have any  indirect sign of
tamponade. A cardiac son[**Name (NI) **] is suggested.
2. Ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.8 cm and its border is not
well
Preliminary Reportdefined. If clinical concern of acute aortic
process remains, a C+ exam is suggested.
3. Bilateral moderate pleural effusion is more prominent on the
left side.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2100-9-23**]
IMPRESSION: Low-normal left ventricular systolic function.
Dilated aortic root with probable small sinus of Valsalva
aneurysm of the right coronary cusp and severe aortic
regurgitation. At least mild mitral regurgitation - diastolic
mitral regurgitation is present, in keeping with severe aortic
regurgitation. There is a moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion without frank tamponade. However, the RV wall looks
hypertrophied, suggesting pulmonary hypertension (signs of
tamponade may be absent with elevated right sided pressures).
Also, the presence of severe aortic regurgitation means that
pulsus paradoxus is insensitive to assess inter-ventricular
interaction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-9-22**],
the current study is more complete. The findings are probably
unchanged.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2100-9-22**]
FINDINGS:  There is moderate cardiomegaly, possible pericardial
effusion, and a moderate left and small right pleural effusion.
A tortuous aorta is seen with aortic arch calcifications.  There
is no pneumothorax and no focal lung consolidation.
Vertebroplasty material is seen in the upper lumbar spine.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2100-9-22**]
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. There is probably
moderate/severe aortic regurgitation with a a sinus of Valsalva
aneurysm of the right coronary cusp. Mildly hypokinetic
ventricular function. Moderate-sized pericardial effusion
without evidence of frank tamponade, although the right atrium
does not fully dilate during atrial diastole, suggesting either
low filling pressures or early tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Pericardial Effusion:  A CXR done on admission noted a left
pleural effusion.  A bedside thoracentesis was to be performed,
however on ultrasound the heart was noted to be close to the
wall. A chest CT was done [**9-22**] which was remarkable for a small
to moderate left effusion with a significant pericardial
effusion and ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm.  An echo was
performed [**9-22**] at the bedside due to concern for tamponade which
showed probable moderate/severe aortic regurgitation with a a
sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp, moderate
sized pericardial effusion without evidence of frank tamponade,
although the right atrium does not fully dilate during atrial
diastole, suggesting either low filling pressures or early
tamponade. A formal echo was performed on [**9-23**] dialted aortic
root with probable small sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right
coronary cusp and severe aortic regurgitaton, a moderate
circumferential pericardial effusion without frank tamponade.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended CT with contrast due to
concern for dissection; CT showed dissection of the thoracic
ascending aorta with possible rupture into pericardium.  CT
surgery was consulted who recomended surgery but the patient
declined. She was medically managed with HR and blood pressure
control but continued to decline over the next several days with
increasing oxygen requirements eventually requiring 100% on a
non-rebreather. The patient and her family made the decision to
be made comfort measures only on [**9-27**]. She was given morphine
and she passed away with her family at her side on the morning
of [**2100-9-28**].

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient has history of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin diagnosed post operatively for a hip
fracture in [**2099-2-7**].  Coumadin was held in setting of GI
bleed.  She was given 5 mg IV metoprolol x2 and rates slowed to
the 120's.  She then had a likely vagal episode and became
acutely bradycardic with a 6 second pause.  The episode resolved
spontaneously and the patient reverted back to atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was transitioned to 25 mg metoprolol
TID but remained in a-fib with rvr. She was placed intermitantly
on diltizem drip and converted to NSR with rates in the 60s.
When the decision was made to make her CMO, these were
discontinued.

#Bright red blood per rectum: The patient present with bright
red blood per rectum in the setting of an elevated INR of 8.0
and HCT of 29.0.  Her hematocrit dropped to 24.2.  She received
2 units pRBCs and had an appropriate rise in hematocrit.  The
INR was corrected with 2 units FFP and 5 mg vitamin K x 2.
Gastroenterology was consulted  who felt this was likely a lower
GI bleed, most likely diverticular or AVM, exacerbated in the
setting of elevated INR. Also on the differential diagnosis are
hemorrhoids and malignancy.  She did have a colonoscopy in [**2098**]
that did not show any polyps, making malignancy unlikely.  The
patient's hematocrit stabled and she had no further episodes of
bleeding.

# Hypoxia: Patient with intermittent desaturation.  Etiology
likely multifactorial secondary to pericardial effusion and poor
reserve with underlying myasthenia.  The CXR did not show any
evidence of acute infection.  She was placed on nasal cannula to
maintain oxygen saturation >92%.  Please see above, but the
patient had increasing oxygen requirments eventually requiring
100% on a non-rebreather. At that time the patient made the
decision to be made CMO.

# Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient was recently diagnosed with
myasthenia after 3 years of progressive symptoms.  She had a
positive anti-acetylchoine receptor antibody and was started on
pyridostigmine with little improvement. She was recently starte
on mestinon.  Neurology was consulted regarding diagnosis and
treatment and concern for underlying malignancy with
paraneoplastic syndrome.  They recommended monitoring vital
capacity and negative inspiratory force.  Neurology weighed in
regarding possibe surgery and advised that the patient may have
a slower recovery coming off of the vent.  The patient and her
family made the decision to be made comfort measures only on
[**9-27**]. She was given morphine and she passed away with her family
at her side on the morning of [**2100-9-28**].

Low Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L4/L5 vertebra and disc biopsy.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 y/o male with a history of IV drug abuse,
cirrhosis, ETOH abuse, DM and HTN who is transfered from [**Hospital6 **] after being diagnosed with L4-L5 osteomyelitis
and epidural inflamation.
.
Patient presents with a history of 12 weeks of lower back pain,
after lifting a steel door. Initially, he felt that it was not
bothering him much, but the pain became progressively worse, and
over the prior 4 days his pain was [**11-15**]. He states that it was
difficult for him to move his left leg. Walking of sitting up
was very difficult. He also refers pain and needles sensation
down his left leg.  Denied bowel incontinence, althouh refers
constipation. No urinary incontinence. No fevers, chills, nausea
or vomiting. He has been tolerating po's well.
.
He refers history of IV drug use, and last time was [**2101-7-25**]
using clean needles. On that date, he did miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5703**] and
re-injected without cleaning the needle.  He developed a large
cellulitis/furunculosis per the patient which he lanced and
subsequently it healed on its own.  He was initially taking
percocet for the pain but given that it was not working, he was
started on methadone that seems to improve his pain control. He
was also drinking vodka over the last 3 days to help with the
pain.
.
He went to see his PCP Dr [**First Name (STitle) 10378**] who decided to sent a Lumbar
MRI. Lumbar MRI [**2101-8-6**] showed discovertebral osteomyelitis at
L4-L5 level with significant epidural inflammation. Also marked
spinal stenosis.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] today. VS: T 99, BP 125/73 Hr 75

Evaluated by neurosurgery who would not intervene at this point
but recomended obtaining biopsy from IR to identify the type of
infection prior to starting antibiotics. They also recomended
blood cx, CRP and ESR. At 19:30, he spiked to 101 and patient
was given antibiotics in the Ed Unasyn, Vancomycin and Flagyl.
He was also given dilaudid and methadone for pain.
.
On review of systems, the pt. denied recent fever or chills. No
night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied headache,
sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough,
shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness,

.
There has been no significant change since the prior study.
.
There is destruction of the L4/5 disc as well as the inferior
endplate of L4 and the superior endplate of L5. There is diffuse
enhancement of the vertebral bodies of L4 and L5 as well as
diffuse enhancement of the surrounding paraspinal soft tissues
extending into the psoas muscles bilaterally. There is also
extension of soft tissue enhancement into the epidural space at
the L4/5 level. This is causing moderate compression of the
thecal sac. These findings are consistent with discitis,
osteomyelitis, with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon, the latter
causing moderate thecal sac compression. No discrete fluid
collections identifying an abscess cavity are seen. The involved
vertebrae and disc are T2 hyperintense, consistent with
inflammatory edema.
.
The conus medullaris normally ends at the level of L1 and no
signal abnormalities of the visualized spinal cord are seen.
.
IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**2101-8-6**], with L4 and L5
with osteomyelitis and discitis, with paraspinal and epidural
phlegmon, the latter causing moderate compression of the thecal
sac. Above findings were discussed with directly with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 10351**], the requesting physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] an emergent neurosurgical
consult was recommended and obtained.
.

TEE ([**8-19**]):
IMPRESSION: No valvular pathology or abscess identified.
.
Chest X-ray:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
2. Questionable nodular opacity at left lung apex, finding that
could indicate a superimposition of vascular and osseous
structures, although dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph
is recommended for further assessment.
.
Scrotal U/S:
IMPRESSION:  Hypoechoic, nonvascular right testicular lesion
concerning for possible neoplasm.  A focal orchitis is felt to
be less likely given the lack of vascular flow.
.
MRI w/  and w/o contrast ([**9-1**]):
No significant change since [**2101-8-8**] with spondylytic discitis
involving the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies with paraspinal and
epidural phlegmon formation causing moderate compression of the
thecal sac.




Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o M with h/o IV drug abuse, cirrhosis, ETOH, hep C, and DM
who presents with L4/L5 osteomyelitis. S/p CT-guided bx of L4/L5
disc on [**8-11**]-Yeast grown from disc cx found to be [**Female First Name (un) **]
albicans. Complicated by thrombocytopenia, ARF, and hypotension.

.
1. L4-L5 osteomyelitis w/ phlegmonous extension: An initial
evaluation by neurosurgery was performed. However, neurosurgery
did not feel that the pt was a candidate for surgery. A medical
approach was taken with various antibiotics over the course of
the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay. An initial blood cx at [**Hospital3 **]
grew [**2-9**] coag-neg staph. No further blood or urine cultures were
positive. So it was thought to be a contaminant although this
could not be ruled out. For this reason, the pt was stared on
Vancomycin which was discontinued later during the hospital
course b/o suspected bone marrow suppression thought to cause
significant thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and anemia. A disc cx
from [**8-11**] grew sparse [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans and beta-glucan lab test
was positive making [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans osteomyelitis most likely
despite a bone cx from [**8-12**] showing no growth. The pt was started
on Amphotericin after the positive cx results. At that time he
was still treated with both Vancomycin and Amphotericin.
However, the pt developed ATN which was attributed to
Amphotericin. So both Vancomycin and Amphotericin have been
D/C'd over the course of his stay b/o ATN and
thrombocytopenia/leukopenia, and treatment with Caspofungin has
been started on [**8-17**] (initially with 35 mg IV q24h, later
increased to 50 mg IV q24h) and continued throughout the
remainder of his stay. The patient was moved to the ICU when
developing recurrent hypotension and worsening renal failure,
but recovered soon thereafter. The patient improved
significantly towards the end of his hospital stay and his
symptoms were well controlled at discharge. He was afebrile and
able to ambulate. A lumbar brace has been placed. CRP was
trending down from 58.6 [**2101-8-7**] to 11.8 [**2101-9-13**]. Further recovery
is expected at an extended care facility. Followup appointments
have been scheduled with ID and neurosurgery. An outpatient MRI
of the L-spine has been scheduled as well. The patient should
also get weekly CBC, LFTs and BUN/Crea while on Caspofungin.
Results should be faxed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9404**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
.
2. Acute Renal Failure. Baseline creatinine was 0.7-0.9 (0.9 on
[**8-15**]). Crea was 2.4 on [**8-16**].8 on [**8-17**].0 on [**8-19**]. He was
anuric from [**Date range (1) 67404**] with uremic symptoms (nausea/vomiting).
His Crea was 5.7 on [**8-22**] after starting CVV hemodialysis on
[**8-20**]. After having been in the ICU b/o ARF and recurrent
hypotension, the patient recovered quickly on the floor and his
kidneys proceded to the polyuric phase. Crea 1.6 on [**8-28**]. Crea
came down to 1.3 towards the end of his stay. After the polyuric
phase, the kidney function returned to [**Location 213**] output. The
patient was asymptomatic at discharge.
.
3. Thrombocytopenia. Plts 152 on admission, Plts 69 on [**8-13**]
on [**8-20**].  Anti-platelet4 (HIT) antibody was positive and the
patient was initially thought to have HIT. All heparin products
were D/C'ed. However, on [**8-26**] Serotonin Release Ab came back
negative. Since HIT Ab not very specific and SRA test negative,
the diagnosis of HIT was questioned at this point. Treatment
with Vancomycin correlated with the worsening thrombocytopenia
and was thought to be a likely cause. After having D/C'ed
Vancomycin, the CBC improved consistently. The pt did not bleed
significantly except for mild R conjunctival bleeding observed
[**8-22**]. Platelet transfusions were given on [**8-24**] in order to raise
plts temporarily for line removals. Platelets came up from 20 to
31 o/n. Platelets came up considerably towards the end of his
stay (Platelets 77 on [**8-31**]). The patient was discharged without
any signs of active bleeding and hemodynamically stable.
.
4. Anemia: Hct 35.9 on [**8-7**].5 on [**8-24**], Pt received 2U PRBC on
[**8-25**] raising Hct up to 26.3 and stable thereafter. Following
course of renal dysfunction, perhaps due to low erythropoeitin
levels. Iron studies consistent w/ ACD. Also occult bleeding was
considered since pt was also thrombocytopenic, cirrhotic, and
uremic. Stools were guaiaced. Improvement was noted when
Vancomycin was D/C'ed. Vancomycin was likely cause of
suppression of all three lines in the bone marrow although
multiple factors were certainly involved. Patient's Hct came up
again towards the end of his stay. Hct was 29.6 [**2101-9-13**]. Pt was
asymptomatic at discharge.
.
5. Leukopenia: WBC dropped down to 2.9 on [**8-24**], but after that
continuously rising. WBC 4.0 on [**8-28**] and stable thereafter
(previous baseline [**6-13**]). Possible causes were immunosuppression
b/o fungal osteo or medications, especially Vancomycin which
causes bone marrow suppression. Vanco had been D/C'ed. WBC
stable. Patient did not develop any opportunistic infections and
his osteomyelitis stayed stable despite the transient
leukopenia. Pt was asymptomatic at discharge.
.
6. Pain: Low back pain with radiation to both legs (R>L) was
managed throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay with a variety of
pain medications including a Fentanyl patch, Methadone at
increasing doses, Morphine, Dilaudid IV and PO, Oxycontin and
Oxycodone. The patient became hypotensive on some of these
medications. The fentanyl patch was D/C'ed b/o that although
multiple factors were likely responsible for his hypotensive
episodes. Methadone was tapered during his hospitalization by 20
mg/day with MSContin increased by 30 mg/day throughout the
taper. His pain regimen on discharge is as follows: MSContin 430
mg [**Hospital1 **], Neurontin 900 mg tid, Tylenol 500 mg qid, Dilaudid 30 mg
q4-6h prn, Tramadol 50 mg q4-6h prn.
.
7. Thigh pain: New left lateral thigh pain on [**8-25**] and right
lateral thigh pain on [**8-28**]. No bruise or bulge at either thigh.
DVT on L leg ruled out with LENIS. Pain seems to be muscular and
most likely due to recent use of LE muscles after extended
periods of immobility. The pain was managed with the same
medications as stated above. The new quality of pain subsided
soon after having been mobile for longer periods and was thought
to be different from his radiating back pain [**3-10**] osteomyelitis.
.
8. Acute scrotal pain: Pt developed acute left scrotal pain
radiating up his groin and flank on [**8-17**]. Pt received 500 cc IV
NS bolus, 4 mg Dilaudid, scrotal and renal u/s were unremarkable
except for an incidentally found R testicular lesion. Urology
was consulted. DD included testicular torsion, orchitis, acute
kidney stone, inguinal hernia. Doppler U/S of kidneys negative
for [**Month/Year (2) 5703**] thrombosis on [**8-17**]. The pain subsided soon after having
been treated with Dilaudid. The exact cause of this episode
remains unclear. A followup appointment has been scheduled with
urology in order to work up the R testicular cystic lesion as
outpt.
.
9. DM: Pt was formerly on Glyburide. Last HbA1c normal. Pt was
rather hypoglycemic at beginning of his hospital stay and was
treated as needed. For the majority of his stay, FS were stable.
Pt was started on metformin 500 mg qam one week prior to
discharge. Pt was asymptomatic throughout his stay.
.
10. Cirrhosis/Hep C: no history of GI bleeding, encephalopathy
or any other complications in the past. Pt developed transiently
cholestatic labs during stay, likely due to infectious process
and mulitple medications. Pt was briefly icteric, but returned
quickly to normal state. Labs remained at baseline elevation for
the remainder of his stay. Pt received Hepatitis A vaccination.
The outpatient medication Spironolactone has been discontinued
during the hospital stay because the patient developed acute
renal failure. It was not restarted upon discharge. It is
recommended to discuss the restarting of spironolactone with his
liver team during follow up as an outpatient.
.
11. Hyponatremia: Initially progressed to sodium of 124, but
later wnl. Pt was euvolemic throughout his hospital stay. No rx
was necessary and sodium was stable at discharge.
.
12. Pos UCx: The patient had GNR growing from a UCx on [**8-30**]
after having spiked a fever once the day before. The UA was
repeatedly negative and the patient remained afebrile
thereafter. A CXR was also negative and a repeat MRI of the
L-spine did not show any significant change to previous MRIs.
The patient completed a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin and
remained asymptomatic.
.
13. HTN: Pt was normotensive with an episode of hypotension as
described above. BP medications were held and BP was monitored
throughout his stay. It is recommended that his medications are
started as an outpatient after monitoring his BP for hypotension
and reevaluating his hypertension.
.
14. H/o alcohol abuse:  Pt was monitored on CIWA, with prn

IMAGING:
[**2196-1-25**] ERCP: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.CBD
was sweeped with balloon catheter and sludge was extracted.
Impression: Normal major papilla
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification.
CBD and intrahepatic biliary tree was normal in calibre.
There was a filling defect that appeared like sludge in the
distal CBD.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
CBD was sweeped with balloon catheter and sludge was extracted.


[**2196-1-30**] BLE Duplex U/S: No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower
extremities.

[**2196-1-30**] CT TORSO (non-con):
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral heterogeneous opacification in the lungs, worst in
the left lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent atelectasis; however,
underlying infectious process such as pneumonia or aspiration
cannot be completely excluded and should be considered in the
correct clinical setting.
2. Status post cholecystectomy with percutaneous biliary drain.
3. Fat-containing ventral periumbilical hernia and a fluid
filled right
inguinal hernia.

[**2196-1-31**] CT TORSO (w/ con):
IMPRESSION:
1. Nondiagnostic examination in the evaluation of pulmonary
embolism
secondary to respiratory motion artifact.
2. No evidence of venous clot in the iliac veins or veins of the
pelvis.
3. Increasing size and number of lymph nodes both in the
mediastinum and
right inguinal area. Clinical correlation recommended to exclude
low grade
hematologic malignancy.
4. Areas of consolidation in bilateral lung bases and in the
right upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] may be on the basis of atelectasis, although
superimposed infection or central obstructing lesion cannot be
excluded based on this examination.

[**2196-2-1**] ECHO: Technically suboptimal study despite the use of
Definity. No clinically useful information was derived. If
clinically indicated, a radionuclide ventriculogram may be
better able to assess biventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service as a direct
admission following ERCP. He was given IV hydration and made
NPO. His LFT's and bilirubin were followed closely and slowly
trended downward. Early discussions took place with patient for
operative management with cholecystectomy for which patient
wanted to discuss further with team and his family before
definitively consenting for this.

On [**1-26**] the he underwent a laparoscopic converted to an open
cholecystectomy. POD #1 his urinary output dropped and he
received fluid along with 1 unit pRBC with adequate urinary
response. On POD #2 he was advanced to a regular diet. He
continued to do well. However, overnight he began to drop his O2
sats and became tachycardic. In addition, his Cr rose to 1.6
from 0.9 the day before. A CXR was performed which showed mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. He was given a dose of Lasix with
no response. An ABG revealed hypoxemia with pO2 of 65. Given the
concern for PE and his ongoing hypoxia, he was transferred to
the ICU for close monitoring.

A CTA chest with PE protocol was unable to be performed because
the patient's Cr had bumped to 1.9. Therefore, a CT torso
without contrast was performed which showed a bilateral lower
[**Month/Day (4) 3630**] opacification (L>R) but was otherwise unremarkable. BLE
duplex U/S was negative for DVT. While in the unit, he became
hypotensive with systolic blood pressures ranging between
70s-80s. He was empirically started on vanc/zosyn. The next day
([**2196-2-1**]), his antibiotics were changed to vanc/Cipro/cefepime to
cover hospital acquired pneumonia. An NGT was placed with
immediate return of 500 cc of coffee ground fluid; his HCT was
found to be 22.8. He was transfused 2 units of pRBC's. GI team
was consulted regarding a potential upper endoscopy. However,
they felt EGD would require elective intubation and therefore
the procedure was deferred. The patient was aggressively fluid
resuscitated and his urine output remained adequate. The
following day his Cr dropped to 1.3 and he was sent for a CTA
with PE protocol which was indeterminate for PE due to motion
artifact but did not show thrombus in the aortoiliac or pelvic
veins. Serial HCT were trended and remained stable. An echo was
attempted [**2-1**] but the quality was suboptimal secondary to the
patient's large body habitus. He still had a significant
supplemental oxygen requirement.

Over the next few days in the ICU his respiratory status
remained tenuous. He was started on intermittent Lasix boluses
[**2196-2-1**] which resulted in large diuresis and he was able to be
weaned to nasal cannula. On [**2196-2-2**], he was started on 20mg PO
Lasix daily and was given 40mg IV Lasix as well as a dose of
Diamox. He again responded with a brisk diuresis but then became
hypotensive overnight requiring 2.5L of fluid boluses. His HCT
in the AM was 21 and he was transfused one unit pRBC's. The
patient also developed an urticarial rash on [**2196-2-2**] and this was
attributed to having switched his Cipro from IV to PO. The Cipro
was therefore discontinued and he was started on Levofloxacin.
His rash has virtually resolved at time of this dictation.

He remained on the Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for the pneumonia
for a total of 7 day course, stop date [**2196-2-10**]. He is also
receiving Flagyl for a presumed C. difficile colitis given his
stool volume. It should be noted that he has had 2 negative
stool for C. Diff cultures. His treatment with Flagyl will
continue for a total of 7 day course. A Flexi seal system was
placed rectally for stool containment and protection of
patient's skin given his large body habitus. Cholestyramine was
started as well.

He was also seen by Psychiatry for his anxiety and depression
and it was recommended to increase his Celexa to 40 mg daily
from 30 mg and to avoid benzodiazepines as this would put him at
risk for delirium.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after his acute hospital stay.

with DES to ostial SVG-D1/OM and DES to proximal SVG-D1/OM.  He
has been on Plavix 75 mg daily and full dose Aspirin.  However,
on Tuesday, 10 days prior to presentation, the patient underwent
a lithotripsy for kidney stones with placement of a ureteral
stent and foley bag and his Plavix was held.  He is currently 10
days off Plavix with his cardiologist and urologist both aware.
.
The patient reports his current symptoms began this morning when
he developed sudden onset, dull, substernal chest pain while
walking at a leisurely pace at an automobile dealership.  The
pain was associated with diaphoresis, and subsequently developed
nausea while being transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  His symptoms
were noted to be different than his prior anginal symptoms of
epigastric pain.  He presented to a fire station where they gave
him full dose aspirin and transported him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  The
patient reports he began developing radiating left arm pain and
precordial pain when he reached the ED.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended Heparin gtt, Plavix
load, and Nitro gtt titrated to pain. Cardiac surgery was
consulted for evaluation of coronary artery revascularization.

EKG ([**12-11**]):  NSR, normal axis.  Dynamic ST depressions in
inferior and precordial leads, more pronounced with increasing
HR on seria EKGs in the ED.
.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**12-13**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated native three vessel CAD. The LMCA had no
angiographically-apparent lesions. The LAD was occluded
proximally, and
had a 90% stenosis just distal to the LIMA-LAD touchdown. The
LCX was
occluded in the mid-vessel segment with faint collaterals to the
OMB.
The dominant RCA was occluded in the proximal vessel segment.
2. Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent
LIMA-LAD.
There was 90% stenosis in the native LAD just distal to the
LIMA-LAD
anastamosis.
3. Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a totally
occluded
SVG-D1/OM1 graft at the proximal segment of ostial stent. The
SVG-PDA
graft was patent to the RCA, but had a 90% retrograde stenosis
to the
PLSA/PLB.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures with a measured central aortic pressure of 106/64/79.
5. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel CAD.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD graft with progression of native distal LAD
disease.
3. Totally occluded SVG-D1-OMB graft.
4. Patent SVG-PDA graft with progression of disease in the
ostium of the
PDA that fills retrograde into the PLSA and posterolateral
branches.
5. Consideration of PCI vs. redo CABG.
.
.
Chest CT ([**12-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-CABG changes and scattered areas of calcified
atherosclerotic disease in the aortic arch and aortic
valve/annulus but none in the ascending aorta.
2. Subtle ground-glass opacities in the right upper and right
lower lobes,
possibly representing areas of aspiration.
3. A 3-mm right lower lobe nodule; given the patient's history,
a one-year
followup CT is recommended to document stability.

CXR: [**2140-12-24**]: PA and lateral chest compared to [**12-21**]
through 29:
The already improved post-operative widening of the
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Moderate right pleural effusion and
moderately severe right basal atelectasis are unchanged, but
previous left lower lobe
atelectasis and left pleural effusion are improved. There is no
pulmonary

patient's symptoms occurred subsequent to discontinuing Plavix
10 days ago for a lithotripsy.  Initial set of CE's were
negative but subsequent up-trended with CK peak 691 and MB peak
77.  He was on a Heparin gtt and was plavix loaded, and his
chest pain was controlled on a Nitro gtt prior to cardiac
catheterization.  Integrillin gtt and Morphine IV prn were
started prior to catheterization for recurrent chest pain
refractory to up-titration of Nitro gtt.  Cardiac
catheterization [**12-13**] showed completely occluded SVG-D1/OM, 90%
stenosis of SVG-PDA, known 90% LAD stenosis just distal to
touchdown.  He was recommended for CABG-redo and was continued
on Heparin gtt and Integrillin gtt post-cath with the plan of
continuing through until CABG-redo.  Plavix was discontinued at
that time.  The patient had an acute drop in his platelets
(described below) and Integrillin gtt was discontinued.  Shortly
thereafter, he had a presyncopal episode on [**12-16**] during which
he stood up, became pale, lightheaded, and developed mild left
sided chest pain.  Vitals were stable but EKG showed new ST
depressions in two leads, CE's negative.  He was transfused 1
unit PRBC for anemia (had previously refused transfusion) with
resolution of symptoms but persistent ST depressions on EKG.
Heparin gtt was discontinued but 5-H risk score for HIT was low
and HIT Ab was negative.  The patient remained chest pain free
until CABG-redo on Tue.

#. Thrombocytopenia:  Patient developed severe
thrombocytopenia,secondary to Integrillin.  Although the
patient's thrombocytopenia occurred later than expected for
integrillin-induced thrombocytopenia, the precipitous drop and
extended period of time he was on integrillin both support this
as the most likely etiology. Plt dropped from 150->10 in 24 hrs.
Integrillin drip was stopped at 2pm on [**12-15**] and he has been
given a total of 3 units of platelets.  HIT Antibody was also
sent which was negative.  5H HIT Risk Score was also low, making
it less likely to be HIT.  However, Heparin gtt was discontinued
in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia given the patient
has been chest pain free.  In the setting of thrombocytopenia,
he developed significant bleeding from around his foley catheter
and recent lithotrypsy procedure, which was switched to a 3-way
foley on CBI.  His hct has down-trended and he received a total
of 1 unit PRBC on [**12-16**].  He was also given several platelet
transfusions for the thrombocytopenia.  The anticipated platelet
recovery with integrillin-induced thrombocytopenia is 4 hours to
5 days, and the patient's platelets slowly up-trended and by
[**12-19**] he was in the 100s.

# Urine analysis:  Patient with large blood, significant
leukocytes, protein on UA likely [**1-26**] recent lithotripsy and
ureteral stent placement.  Foley leg bag in place, dark red
urine in setting of Plavix, Heparin gtt, ASA 325.  Urology
followed pt inhouse. Patient had significant bleeding from
around the foley and it was replaced with a 3-way foley catheter
on CBI.  Urology planned to remove ureteral stent and foley and
following CABG.  Repeat UA suspicious for UTI, started Cipro
[**12-15**].  Repeat UA today in setting of culture showing ""probable""
enterococcus previously in the setting of significant blood in
urine and improved urine currently.  Repeat UA and UCx sent
after bleeding hematuria improved. The patient was treated with
Cipro 250 mg x7 days for complicated cysistits in male with
recent urologic procedure. (d1=[**12-15**])

On [**12-15**] Mr.[**Known lastname 1007**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Redo sternotomy/ Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 (reverse
saphenous vein grafts to the second branch of the posterior left
ventricular branch, obtuse marginal artery, and left anterior
descending artery)with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. CROSSCLAMP TIME:65 minutes.PUMP
TIME:  99 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated. He awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Pressors were weaned
off. All lines and drains were discontinued per protocol.
Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis initiated. POD#1 he
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. As discussed with Urology, the foley catheter was
discontinued per csurg protocol. The following morning he failed
to void and the foley was reinserted. A second void trial was
done on POD#4 and he voided. The remainder of his postoperative
course was essentially uneventful. He continued to progress and
on POD5 he was cleared for discharge to home with VNA. All
follow up appointments were advised.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year old male with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post multiple
recent admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flares, status post recent discharge from [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**5-16**], when he was intubated in
the Medicine Intensive Care Unit for a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare.  The patient was doing well at home
according to his wife, until early in the evening of
admission when he complained of shortness of breath which did
not respond to inhalers.  The patient says he tried his
nebulizer in the bathroom as he was getting more short of
breath.  It did not help.  He then took a shower and felt
more short of breath after that.  The patient called 911.  He
was intubated in the field for air movement and respiratory
distress, with minimal breath sounds reported and somnolence,
however, his oxygen saturation was 90 percent on room air.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially
started on a Propofol drip which dropped his dropped his
blood pressure from 167/104 to the 90s.  He was then given
approximately 5 liters of intravenous fluids.  He also
received Solu-Medrol and Levofloxacin.  In the Emergency
Department, a femoral line was placed, given his low blood
pressure and he was started on Dopamine for the hypotension.
The patient arrived at the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stated and easily ventilated
with the ventilator.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
on 4 liters of home oxygen, status post multiple admissions
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flares, status post
multiple intubations, status post a history of tracheostomy
color.

Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

Coronary artery disease, status post multiple myocardial
infarctions, most recently an NSTE myocardial infarction in
[**2102-4-6**].

Chronic low back pain, status post L1-2 laminectomy.

Steroid-induced hyperglycemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Combivent, Flovent, Lipitor,
Aspirin, Prednisone 40 on a taper, Metoprolol 25 b.i.d.,
Lisinopril 5 once a day, Calcium, Vitamin B, Colace, Percocet
and Protonix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 28 pack year smoking
history.  He has quit.  He is married.  He has rare ethyl
alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother had [**Name (NI) 2481**] and asthma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 100.4, heart
rate 79, blood pressure 100/42, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 95 percent.  This was on his control at 480 by 20,
40 percent FIO2 and 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure.
General:  This was a chronically ill-appearing gentleman.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  He had edematous sclera.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes
were dry.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm, normal S1,
tachycardiac.  Lungs:  Essentially clear to auscultation with
occasional rhonchi.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities were
without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There was a right
femoral line in place.  The patient was sedated and
intubated.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count was 11.8, hematocrit
40.9, platelets 228, INR 1.1, urinalysis was negative for
infection.  Sodium was 138, potassium 4.0, bicarbonate 27,
BUN 28, creatinine 1, glucose 187.  Blood gas after
intubation 7.23, 74, 476.  Lactate was 2.4.  Chest x-ray
showed the endotracheal tube in good position, tortuous
aorta, emphysematous changes with no evidence of pneumonia or
failure.  An electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardiac at 130
without any acute ST changes with enlarged P waves in 2, 3
and AVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease/respiratory failure - The patient carries the
diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
multiple admissions and intubations, all of which seemed to
resolve rather quickly once the patient was intubated.  This
one was similar.  Within 24 hours after admission the patient
was easily extubated and did quite well after that, making
great improvement, back to his baseline within two days.  It
was felt that this is not consistent with either an asthma
attack or a true chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation or infection.  There is concern that some other
process was causing the patient's acute episodes of shortness
of breath.  In fact, it is not clear the extent of his
respiratory distress when he was intubated in the field,
initially even though he was oxygenating well and had poor
breath sounds at baseline.  The patient was treated with high-
dose steroids initially as well as q. 4 hour nebulizer
inhalers.  However, his lungs have been clear almost
immediately upon admission.  Because of concern that there
might be airway collapse contributing, the patient underwent
a computerized tomography scan which was designed to look for
tracheomalacia.  The computerized tomography scan was
misprotocoled and this could not be evaluated.  There was a
suspicion that there might be left main stem bronchus
collapse during expiration and it was read as probable distal
tracheomalacia.  The patient was provided with a BiPAP
machine and teaching.  He responded very well to this at
nighttime.  It was suggested that he use the BiPAP at
nighttime and as needed when he feels short of breath and his
shortness of breath is not helped by his usual nebulizers.
The hope is that this might prevent him from needing to call
911 and from repeated intubations.  The patient did receive
one dose of Levofloxacin, however, there is no sign of
infection and this antibiotic was discontinued.

Hypotension - The patient was initially hypotensive in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  This was after receiving Propofol and then other
sedating medications.  He required pressors briefly for
Dopamine which increased his heart rate and made him
tachycardiac.  He was then switched to Levophed.  It was felt
this was all in the setting of sedating medications as well
as ventilator positive end-expiratory pressure as the patient
did not actually appear septic at any time, he has had all of
that quite well and was normotensive once he was extubated,
in fact, on discharge he was restarted on his blood pressure
medications.

Hypertension - The patient has hypertension as an outpatient
at baseline.  His Metoprolol and ACE inhibitor were held.
Initially they were restarted on the day of discharge.

Coronary artery disease - The patient has a coronary artery
disease history.  He was continued on his Aspirin and his
Lipitor during the admission.  In the setting of hypotension,
he did have some hyperacute T waves on electrocardiogram.
His enzymes were cycled and they were negative for
infarction.  As noted, his Metoprolol and ACE inhibitor were
restarted prior to discharge.

Renal failure - Initially the patient presented with elevated
lactate and slightly elevated creatinine but these corrected
quickly with fluids.

Prophylaxis - The patient was continued on a proton pump
inhibitors as well as with heparin subcutaneously while in
the hospital.  He was then ambulatory by the day of
discharge.

Code status - The patient confirmed that he is a full code.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to home with his
usual services.  He will also be provided with a BiPAP
machine for use as described above.  The patient should
follow up with both his primary care physician and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**] within the next one to two weeks.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Resumed medications as before
including a taper of Prednisone.

Call your primary doctor or the Emergency Department with any
concerns for shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea or
vomiting.

See your primary doctor, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8499**] within one

EGD ([**2147-5-8**])
Esophagus:
Lumen: A complex, sliding, medium paraesophageal hernia was
seen.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Excavated Lesions. A single cratered ulcer was found
in the duodenal bulb. A clot suggested recent bleeding. 4
cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] hemostasis with success. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP
Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully. A single
superficial ulcer was found in the distal bulb. A visible vessel
suggested recent bleeding. 4 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] hemostasis
with success. A hemoclip was then applied to the visible vessel.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course: 2 large-bore IVs were placed. The pt's ASA, BB,
ACEi and Lasix were held. She had no further BMs or melena. She
remained HD stable with SBP in 110s and HR in 70s after initial
2L NS bolus. She was transiently on a PPI drip and was
transfused a total of 4U with HCT coming up to 27 from 18. Her
HCT remained stable after these initial 4 units.
.
GI did not feel that the pt was still actively bleeding, thus no
urgent scope was performed in the MICU. She was switched to PPI
IV bid and started on clears which she tolerated well. The pt
was transferred to the medicine floor for further management.
.
Floor Course:
# GI bleed: The pt required a total of 7 units pRBCs to maintain
her HCT over her hospital course. She had an EGD performed by GI
which demonstrated a single cratered ulcer in the duodenal bulb
with stigmata of recent bleeding. This was injected with
epinephrine and clipped; GI indicated that a risk of rebleeding
remained. The pt was treated with a Protonix gtt for >48 hours
and then transitioned to PO therapy [**Hospital1 **]. The pt's HCT was stable
for the remainder of her [**Hospital 62681**] hospital stay at
around 27 to 28. The pt's antihypertensives were held in this
setting and her blood pressure was well-controlled with only
diltiazem. The pt's home aspirin was held.
.
# A-fib/SVT: At the time of admission, the pt was taking ASA 325
[**Hospital1 **] for her prior history of PAF; this was stopped at the time
of admission. In the setting of having her beta blocker held,
the pt was noted to have several episodes of AF with RVR (HR to
the 140s), as well as two episodes of SVT (HR again to 140s)
that was thought to likely represent AVNRT. All of these
episodes were asymptomatic for her and she remained HD stable. A
TSH and CXR were checked and were unremarkable. Although the
pt's HR responded well to re-initiation of her beta blocker,
this did not suppress her SVT, and thus her beta blocker was
transitioned to PO diltiazem. At the time of discharge, she had
not had any SVT for 24 hours. We would suggest possible
up-titration of her diltiazem as allowed by her HR and BP, and
eventual conversion to the long-acting form of the medication.
.
# Diastolic dysfunction: The pt appeared euvolemic throughout
her stay. A chest x-ray after several days without Lasix did not
demonstrate any evidence of failure. A echo in [**2145**] demonstrated
preserved EF and mild AR. As above, the pt's ACEi, beta blocker
and lasix were held at admission; ***these may need to be
restarted in the future.***
.
# CAD: The pt had a negative stress-MIBI in [**2145**]. Her ASA was
held throughout her hospital stay as described above. When her
HR was elevated, the pt was noted to have fairly diffuse ST
depressions which resolved with better HR control, thus
continued aspirin therapy, likely at 325 mg daily, would be
ideal. This was deferred at the time of discharge so that the
pt's HCT could be followed for another 1-2 weeks.
.
# Dementia: The pt remained pleasantly and mildly demented
throughout her hospital course. There was no evidence of
delirium.

Discharge Instructions:
-You were admitted with bleeding in your GI tract that was
caused by an ulcer. We have treated you with blood transfusions,
applied clips to the blood vessels in your ulcer and are giving
you medications to help prevent a recurrence. You are being
discharged to rehab before going home to help regain your
strength.
-It is important that you continue to take your medications as
directed. We made the following changes to your medications
during this admission:
--> Aspirin was held because of bleeding. Talk with your doctor
about when or if to restart this.
--> Your home metoprolol was changed to diltiazem. This is a
similar medicine that we think will do a better job of
controlling your heart rate.
--> Your Lasix was stopped because your blood pressure was
normal. Please talk with your doctor about when to restart this.
--> Your lisinopril was stopped because your blood pressure was
normal. Please talk with your doctor about when to restart this.
-Contact your doctor or come to the Emergency Room should your
symptoms return. Also seek medical attention if you develop any
new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting or unusual stools.

On Discharge:
Awake, alert and oriented to person, place and date. Face is
symmetric, tongue with a slight left deviation. Full strength
and sensation throughout. Wound is clean, dry and intact without
signs of infection.

Pertinent Results:
[**2104-5-19**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION: There are two rim-enhancing lesions peripherally
located within the right frontal lobe, as described above, with
associated vasogenic edema and mass effect. The inferior lesion
demonstrates a punctate focus of hemorrhage. While the superior
lesion does abut the dura, it lacks characteristic dural tail,
making meningioma a less likely consideration.  Moreover, the
more inferior lesion does appear intra-axial on coronal and
sagittal reformatted images. Differential diagnosis
includes metastatic disease versus abscess.

[**2104-5-19**] MRI Brain w/ & w/o:
1. Two enhancing right frontal lesions most consistent with
metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema and right frontal
sucal effacment.
2. 2mm leftward shift of midline structures.

CT Torso:
1. No definite evidence of malignancy. Consolidation within the
superior
segment of the left lower lobe may represent infection, but
there is a
slightly more rounded appearance inferiorly, and consider repeat
chest CT
following treatment. Prominent left-sided intrapulmonary lymph
nodes may be reactive.
2. Gallbladder sludge.
3. Gas tracking in the posterior subcutaneous tissues and
extending into the left paraspinal musculature and left psoas
muscle. Findings are likely
related to pressure erosion. There is no focal fluid collection.

4. Trace pelvic free fluid. Slightly limited evaluation of the
pelvis due to motion artifact, but no gross abnormalities are
identified.

CT head [**2104-5-22**]:
Expected postoperative appearance status-post right craniotomy.
Unchanged 2mm leftward shift of midline structures

MRI brain [**5-23**]:
1. Two curvilinear foci of residual enhancement of the right
frontal lobe.  Continued attention on followup studies is
recommended.
2. Interval resection of the two right frontal lesions.
Persistent,
unchanged right frontal edema and 2 mm leftward shift of midline
structures.
3. No evidence of acute infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 54 year old F in her usual state of health until an
episode of syncope and seizure. OSH CT revealed a brain mass
with vasogenic edema. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where a
Head CT was repeated- again showing a  two rim-enhancing lesions
peripherally located within the right frontal lobe with
associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.  Pt was admitted to
the ICU under Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] care. A Brain MRI was done on
[**2104-5-19**] which showed two enhancing right frontal lesions most
consistent with metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema and
right frontal sulcal effacement

A CT Torso was done on [**5-19**], which was negative for any primary
lesion or mets, but did show ground glass opacity in RUL.

She was consented and pre-oped, and went to the OR for resection
of this mass on [**5-22**]. The procedure went well without
complications. The preliminary pathology report was metastatic
carcinoma. She remained in the PACU overnight for Q1 hour neuro
checks post-op. CT head was negative for hemorrhage.

She was stable on [**5-23**] and she was transferred to the Step down
unit. Her Foley and A-line was discontinued. She had an MRI.

PT and OT were ordered. She was cleared for home on [**5-26**] with PT
outpatient needs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Hepatobiliary Surgical Service
on [**2138-8-13**] with abdominal pain and weakness as described above.
His initial labs demonstrated a significant anemia, with a
hematocrit of 19.7. Further review of his history raised the
possibility of an upper GI bleed, as it was determined he had
been taking high doses of NSAIDs for his abdominal pain, and had
unclear history of melanotic stools and/or blood-tinged emesis.
He was initially admitted to the Surgical ICU, where he was
stabilized with 2 units of packed red blood cells. His
hematocrit then rose to 23.4, at which time he was transfused an
additional 2 units. His hematocrit then stabilized at 28.2.

A CT of his abdomen performed shortly after admission on [**2138-8-13**]
revealed the following:
1.  Extensive hepatic lesions (presumably HCC) with extensive
mesenteric root, porta hepatis lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy as well as mesenteric/omental implants and
possible pancreatic and mesenteric vein invasion as described
above.  Nonhemorrhagic ascites. No areas of active hemorrhage
within the mass lesions or along the course of the bowel are
present.
2.  Gastroesophageal varices.
3.  Nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis. New bilateral pulmonary nodules concerning for
metastases.

Given the size and distribution of his hepatic lesions, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was determined to be not eligible for surgical
resection. Mr. [**Known lastname **] also received an esophago-gastric
endoscopy to evaluate his suspected upper GI bleed, anemia, and
abdominal pain. This study revealed the following:
- [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] B distal esophagitis, 2 cords of small esophageal
varices without red whale signs left undisturbed, irregular GEJ
with 2 tongues of salmon like mucosa left undisturbed.
- Diffuse mild to modorate erythema with deformed antrum and
pyloric area. One small 1cm clean based ulcer with surrounding
edema and erythema left undisturbed. Retroflex view revealed a
moderate hiatal hernia, hiatus ~3cm.
- Duodenitis and one small <1cm superficial clean based ulcer in
the duodenal bulb left undisturbed, normal second portion.
- Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.

The etiology of his anemia was determined to be a combination of
hepatic lesions/HCC as well as upper GI bleed, possibly
secondary to NSAID use. After hemodynamic and cardiovascular
stabilization with transfusions as above, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
transferred out of the SICU to the surgical floor. His liver
lesions and clinical case was discussed during a
multi-disciplinary hepatic tumor conference. It was determined
he would benefit from biopsy of his lesions, with possible
systemic therapy to be determined as an outpatient. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] future outpatient care was coordinated with the
hematology-oncology service, and he was discharged on [**8-16**], [**2137**].

Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60-year-old male
with metastatic melanoma, admitted to begin cycle 1, week 1
high-dose IL-2 therapy. His oncologic history began in [**2184-7-27**], when he noted a right groin skin tag which grew quickly
over 2 months. Excisional biopsy in [**2184-10-27**] revealed a
greater than 11 mm thick, ulcerated melanoma with perineural
invasion and mitotic rate of 8 per meters squared. He was
referred to Cutaneous [**Hospital **] Clinic, at which point 2
subcutaneous nodules along the right groin scar were noted
and a left posterior shoulder subcutaneous nodule was noted.
Fine needle aspiration confirmed a melanoma at the site. PET
CT revealed widespread metastases in the lung, liver,
subcutaneous tissues and bone. Brain MRI was negative. He was
evaluated for high-dose IL-2 and passed eligibility testing
to begin therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  BPH, status post laparoscopic
cholecystectomy in [**2178**], left knee arthroscopic surgery
complicated by left DVT, hypertension, sleep apnea,
osteoarthritis of the right knee, melanoma as above, benign
positional vertigo, history of pseudogout, history of C-7
narrowing with occasional nerve pain.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril 20 mg daily, on hold, Flomax 0.4 mg
daily, Proscar 5 mg daily, Naprosyn 500 daily to b.i.d.
p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing male in no
acute distress. Performance status 1. VITAL SIGNS: 97.5, 130,
18, 133/80, O2 saturation 94% in room air. HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic. Sclerae anicteric. Moist oral
mucosa without lesions, multiple scalp nodules present. NECK:
Supple. LYMPH NODES: No cervical, supraclavicular, bilateral
axillary or bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Right groin
subcutaneous nodules noted. HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm,
S1 and S2. CHEST:  Clear to percussion and auscultation
bilaterally. ABDOMEN:  Rounded, positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, no HSM or masses. EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity
edema. NEURO EXAM: Nonfocal. SKIN: Right groin biopsy site
healed without nodularity. There are subcutaneous nodules
above and below the biopsy site as well as scattered scalp

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent
central line placement to begin therapy. His admission weight
was 106.6 kg, and he received interleukin-II 600,000
international units per kilogram, equaling 64 million units
IV q.8h. x14 potential doses. During this week, he received
10 of 14 doses, with 1 dose held for questionable
neurotoxicity and 3 doses held due to development of
tachypnea, stridor and respiratory distress, requiring
mechanical ventilation. This event occurred in early morning
hours of treatment day #5 and he was transferred emergently
to the ICU and intubated, given stridor and tachypnea. He was
not having significant hypoxia at this time. He then became
hypotensive, requiring initiation of phenylephrine and
Levophed. At the time of his intubation, his bicarbonate was
15 and he was aggressively treated with bicarbonate
repletion. The patient was intubated x4 days and was
eventually extubated on [**1-11**]. He continued to recover
and was recovering was transferred back to the floor on
[**1-12**], where rehab was initiated. He developed
Clostridium difficile diarrhea, improved on Flagyl. He was
eventually discharged to home on [**2185-1-15**] with
physical therapy.

Other side effects during IL-2 therapy included mild chills;
development of an erythematous skin rash; nausea, improved
with lorazepam; diarrhea, improved with Lomotil, and fatigue

During this week, he developed acute renal failure with a
peak creatinine of 7.3, improved to 1.3 at the time of
discharge. He developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak
bilirubin of 7.1, improved to 1.1 upon discharge. He also
developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 100 and peak AST
of 117, improved to within normal limits at the time of
discharge. He was anemic with hemoglobin of 7.2, improved to
11.7 after packed red blood cell transfusion. He was
thrombocytopenic with a platelet count low of 55,000, without
evidence of bleeding. As noted above, he developed metabolic
acidosis, felt to be at least partially responsible for his
respiratory failure, with a minimum bicarbonate of 14,
improved with bicarbonate repletion. He had no evidence of
coagulopathy or myocarditis. By [**2185-1-15**] he was
discharged to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 y/o female recently dx with AML on supportive
treatment only, on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and h/o TIA,
who presented to the ED with c/o maroon-colored stools x 6 days
and fatigue with SOB x several days. Pt noted blood also mixed
in with stool, but denies any increase in frequency of stool. No
abd pain, n/v/hematemesis or other changes in bowel habits.
.
In the ED, labs were significant for a Hct of 15.8, WBC of 45.8,
and INR of 7.7. Maroon stool, guiac positive in rectum but NG
lavage negative. Pt was hemodynamically stable throughout. She
was given 1 U PRBC, 2 U FFP, and 5 mg SC vit K. GI was consulted
in the ED and feels this may be a LGIB, but also could be a
UGIB. Conversation with PCP and family lead to decision of
tagged RBC scan to attempt localization of site in an effort to
avoid invasive procedures, including EGD/colonoscopy given
comorbid conditions. Tagged RBC scan demonstrated brisk bleeding
from the cecum.

History of Present Illness:
51 yo male with AIDs (dx [**2158**], on HAART, VL undetectable, CD4 90
[**1-3**], h/o thrush and esophagitis) admitted with back pain/flank
pain and fevers. He was in hus USOH until [**2174-1-27**] when he went
to his PCP's with R sided pleurtic chest pain. He also had a
resurangence of fevers to 102 - 105 and night sweats which he
had had for 13 years, then stopped 2 years prior when he started
HAART. CXR on [**2174-1-27**] showed infiltrate within the left upper
lobe and an opacityl at the right heart border. He was started
on Levaquin at that time. Then on [**2174-2-3**], he went to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with L calf pain. He was admitted with a DVT and
multiple PEs. Chest CT at that time also showed multiple
bilateral segments and subsegmental pulmonary emboli,
consolidation vs. infarct in the posterior left upper lobe and
anterior right lower lobe, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules,
and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. MDs there were also concerned
that he could have TB as he had weight loss, fevers, and pulm
nodules. He underwent bronch on [**2174-2-7**] which was ""normal"".
Cytology showedd atypical flora. Cultures/labs from there showed
negative crypto ag, oral flora from the bronch, AFB smear
negative, culture pending. He was started on coumadin and
heparin and a second of levofloxacin. During this stay, he had
no pulmonary symptoms.
.
On discharge from [**Location (un) 620**], he noticed his Right leg now was
tender, where it had not been before. He then was switched to a
course of Doxy on [**2-11**] my his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was not doing well at home
since he was having extreem pain in both his legs. The swelling
in the LLE diminished, but the right increased. He had no
pulmonary symptoms until the afternoon on [**2-18**] when he began to
become SOB. He came to the ED.
.
In ED, initial vitals were 103.6, HR 145, BP 78/62, RR 18, 98%
-> 100% on 2L .He was complaiing of worsening SOB and pleurtic
right chest pain. Code sepsis called, RIJ placed. Initial CVP
was 7. he was boluesd 8 L NS in the ED. Of note, his O2 sat on
arrival was 98% RA, then 100% 2l in the ED,94% on 4L NC on
arrival to MICU. he was started on Dopamine and levophed. He was
given 1 gram of vancomycin, 1 gram of CTX, and a DS bactrim.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent. A ct chest revealed
a left upper lobe opacity, subsegmental PE's, multiple B pulm
nodules.
.
Currently, he is SOB and c/o pleurtic right sided and posterior
chest pain and bilateral calf pain. He has been having fevers to
102 - 105 daily with night sweats. Denies large weight gain (he
has had touble with weight loss since his MAC). No HA. No neck
pain. No nausea. No vomiting. Has one loose BM daily [**3-3**] HAART.
Denies missing any of his medicine. Quit smoking 2 eeks agi. No

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 51 yo m with AIDS, recent diagnosis of PE, pulmonary
nodules, fevers, and shock. His shock is most likely due to
sepsis given his increasing WBC and low CVP making right heart
strain from PE unlikley.
.
Plan:
# Septic shock: He seems to be in distributive shock. Most
likely this is sepsis, given that he is immunocompromised with
fevers and respiratory distress. However,  Adrenal insufficiency
unlikely given normal [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. Given his
immunocomprimised state, he has many potential sources for
sepsis including bactreial, fungal, and viral. Infectious
disease was consulted who recommended continue treatment with
caspofungin, azithromycin, imipenem-cilastin. Continue
antiretrovirals and bactrim ppx.  Unclear source at this point.
So far all cultures NGTD, cryptococcus, CMV, and histo
serologies negative, AFB x3, PCP stain, [**Name9 (PRE) 20613**] ag, negative.  Pt
was placed on Sepsis protocol. With frequent NS fluid bolus for
CVP >12 and pressors.  He had episode of NSVT on arrival while
on dopamine and was changed over to levophed, which he required
for several days of his addmision to keep MAP>65. Given
persistent hypotension concern for neurogenic shock secondary to
autonomic dysfunction, Neuro consult was obtained who did not
think that patient has autonomic dysfunction on initial
assessement.
.
#  Respiratory distress - as above, most likely secondary to
pulmonary infection complicated by pulmonary emboli. Required
significant oxygen supplementation initially but this was
reduced by 6 days of hospitalization from NRB to 40% by
facemask.
.
# PE/DVT: Hx of DVT and PE on recent hospitalization.  RL LENI
shows DVT this admission.  Given likely coumadin failure IVC
filter was placed.  Pt was started on heparin initially and then
changed over to lovenox 1mcg/kg [**Hospital1 **].  [**2-27**] AM with RUE swelling
as well, with DVT.  Heme onc consulted, started on heparin as
developing DVTs through lovenox.
- Given recurrent dvt and ?pulmonary nodules and enlarged
lymphnode concern for malignancy in setting of hypercoguble
state high.
- Currently morphine prn.
.
#. hemoptysis - likely secondary to underlying pulmonary
processes. Consider bronchoscopy only if this worsens (currently
stable).
.
#Polyuria - Unclear etiology. Continues to urinate to the point
of hypotension despite IVF being stopped. [**Month (only) 116**] have neprogenic DI
[**3-3**] ambisome. [**Month (only) 116**] also not be able to concentrate urine to
excrete all the salt he has gotten on the sepsis portocol
causing an solute diuresis. Gave dose of ddAVP to see if can
concentrate urine. Ambisome switched to caspofungin.
- Renal was consulted given concern for DI.  They did not think
that the pt has diabetes insipidus given that the patient has
had normal Uosm and Una. More likely, this is consistent with a
solute diuresis from the large amounts of fluid the patient has
received during this hospitalization. It is unclear whether he
is intravascularly depleted or overloaded, and his weight is up
approx 6kg. If he is making appropriate urine to previous IVF
administration, would expect his urine now to more accurately
match his input.  With restriction on NS IVF, pt's urine output
has improved.
.
# Infection - unclear etiology most likely source of infectionis
pulmonary, but differential in this immunocompromised patient is
very broad. ID following. So far all cultures NGTD,
cryptococcus, CMV, and histo serologies negative
- on retrovirals, azithro/bactrim
- imipenem dc'd- continuing with vanco
.
## Neuro - pt with c/o diplopia this morning which is new.  Also
with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process.
- per discussion with neuro attg, given pt's likely
hypercoaguble state need to rule out stroke.
- MRI/MRA -small L cerebellar stroke, w/ sluggish basilar artery
flow, CTA also showed no thrombus but decreased basilar artery
flow.  Per Neuro ordered TTE w/ bubble, no ASD or PFO
- Daily CT showed no change (needs daily CTx7 day to assess no
hemorrhagic development
.
#Hemoptysis - likel secodary to PE and PNA. Stable in amount and
frequency. Is small amounts at this time. If decompensates of
hemoptysis progresses beyond tsp amounts will need bronchoscopy
and possible surgical consult.
.
## Neuro - pt with c/o diplopia this morning which is new.  Also
with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process.
- per discussion with neuro attg, given pt's likely
hypercoaguble state need to rule out stroke.
- MRI/MRA to eval for stroke.

[**2109-6-2**]: chest x-ray:

Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
Clear lungs

[**2109-6-2**]: x-ray of the abdomen:

FINDINGS: Supine AP portable view of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained. A vertical line of skin surgical staples is seen
coursing in the midline. The inferior aspect of a nasogastric
tube is seen coiling in the left upper quadrant, in the expected
location of the stomach. Coursing into the left upper quadrant,
is a curvilinear radiopaque structure consistent with a JP
drain. Additional scattered staples are seen projecting over the

groin/buttock bilaterally, noted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to be external
to the patient, staples holding down drapes. No radiopaque
foreign body concerning for surgical sponge or instrument is
seen. No evidence of bowel obstruction.

[**2109-6-3**]: chest x-ray:

 FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-2**], the endotracheal
and
nasogastric tubes remain in satisfactory position. The pulmonary
vascularity in the apical region is somewhat sparse bilaterally,
though no definite pleural line to indicate pneumothorax. If
this is a clinical concern, repeat expiration view could be
obtained.






Brief Hospital Course:
 22 year old gentleman admitted to the acute care service with
an abdominal stab wound.  He was intubated at the scene
requiring fluid resuscitation including blood products. He was
hemodynamically stable upon transport. Upon admission, he was
taken emergently to the operating room where he underwent an
oversewing of an anterior-posterior gastrotomy.  He also had an
injury to a branch of a gastric vessel which was oversewn.
Because there was a concern for an aortic injury, he was
evaluated by the Vascular team.  He was found not to have an
aortic injury.
 During his operative course, he had a 500cc blood loss and
received 1 UPRBC.  He was monitored in the intensive care unit
after the procedure.  He had an NG tube in place and a JP drain.
On POD #1 he was extubated.  His incisional pain was managed
with a morphine PCA and changed to a dilaudid PCA because of
reports of nausea.  He was transported to the surgical floor POD
#1. He was evaluated by Social services  and they have provided
additional support to him and his family and made
recommendations about the availibility of community programs.
His foley catheter was discontinued on POD #2 and he voided
without difficulty.  His vital signs are stable and he is
afebrile.  His hematocrit has stablized at 36.6.  His
[**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was discontinued on POD #3 and his JP drain
was d/ced prior to his discharge.
He had mild nausea which has been controlled with an
anti-emetic. He had been out of bed.His diet was slowly advanced
which he tolerated well.His diet was advanced to regular and he
was started on oral pain meds on [**2109-6-7**] which he tolerated
well.
He was discharged on [**2109-6-8**], when he was tolerating a regular
diet, voiding normally and ambulating without any difficulty. He
would follow up with the [**Hospital 2536**] clinic in [**12-30**] weeks.

2. 9-cm hematoma inferior to the porta hepatis and small amount
of free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis.

[**2112-5-5**] Liver U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. Status post liver [**Month/Day/Year **] with patent vasculature.
2. Two focal fluid collections adjacent to the left lateral
segment
(measuring 3 cm) and inferior to the right lobe of the liver
(measuring
approximately 1.4 cm) are noted.
3. Two echogenic structures within the transplanted liver may
represent
surgical clips versus calcifications and less likely pneumobilia
and are in  unchanged position compared to [**2112-4-29**].

[**5-6**] ERCP - Impression:
The [**Month/Year (2) **] bile duct above the stricture was approximately
5mm and the native CBD was approximately 8mm.
Given the small contrast leak at the anastomosis, balloon
dilation of the stricture was not performed.
A sphincterotomy was performed in 12 o'clock position with a
sphincterotome successfully.
A 10Fr x 9cm Advanix plastic biliary stent was placed across the
stricture with excellent drainage of bile and contrast.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Month/Year (2) 1326**] surgery service on
[**2112-4-28**] and had an Orthotopic liver [**Date Range **]. Surgeon was Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Please refer to operative note for further details.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
intubated to the SICU for management. On POD 1 he was found to
have a large hematoma near the porta and was taken back to the
OR for washout and evacuation of the hematoma. This procedure
was also well tolerated.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Fentanyl &
Dilaudid IV with good effect and adequate pain control. When
tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral
pain medications.

CV: The patient was hypertensive on beginning POD 1 and
initially required hydralazine IV. Once tolerating Po he was
switched to PO Norvasc and Lopressor. The patient was otherwise
stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were
routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: Following extubation, the patient was stable from a
pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI/GU: IV fluids were given until tolerating oral intake. His
diet was advanced to clears on POD 3 and to a regular diet on
POD 4, which was tolerated well. Patient had lower extremity
edema and rhonchi on auscultation. The lateral JP, located in
the hepatic/diaphragmatic gutter was discontinued on POD [**5-3**]
and the medial JP, located near the porta hepatis was
discontinued on [**5-8**]. He was thought to be fluid oveloaded and
on POD 3, 4, & 6 and was administered Lasix IV. Foley was
removed on POD 4, once his fluid status had stabalized. Intake
and output were closely monitored. The patients LFT's increased
on POD 7&8 and he underwent an unremarkable liver U/S. on POD 8
he had an ERCP that showed a stricture and a small bile leak at
the CBD anastamosis. A plastic stent was placed by GI. The
patient tolerated the procedure well and his LFT's trended down
after the procedure.
Endo: He experienced hyperglycemia from the steroids and
required and insulin drip for several days. This was
transitioned to Glargine and a Humalog sliding scale per the
consulting [**Name8 (MD) **] MD. He was taught how to check his blood
glucose and how to draw up and administer insulin. VNA services
were arranged to assist at home as insulin was new for him.

ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on Bactrim,
Valcyte, and Fluconazole for PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1074**]/EBV, and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The
patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of
infection.

Immunosuppression: He received induction immunosuppression
(solumedrol and cellcept). Postop, solumedrol was taperedb by
post op day 6 to prednisone 20mg daily. Cellcept 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] was
well tolerated. Prograf was initiated on postop day 1 and dose
adjusted per daily trough levels.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on POD [**11-20**], the patient was doing
well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.

PT cleared him for home. VNA for medication (newly on insulin)
was arranged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] presented to the ED with chest pain. He was
appropriately medically managed and admitted for further
work-up. He underwent a cardiac cath on [**9-2**] which revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. He underwent
pre-operative work-up and on [**9-5**] was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 5 (Left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein grafts to diagonal ramus obtuse marginal and
posterior descending arteries). Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring intubated and sedated in stable
condition. Later this day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
started on beta-blockers/ statin/aspirin/diuretics and gently
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Later on this day he was
transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Physical
Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility
and cleared him safe to return to home with VNA services when
ready. He did have some abdominal pain, nausea and abdominal
distention on post operative day 4. A KUB showed marked small
bowel dilation with air-fluid levels concerning for small bowel
obstruction.  All liver function tests and amylase/ lipase were
essentially normal.  His Lasix was stopped, IVF was given and
his abdominal pain slowly resolved. Repeat KUB showed ileus.  At
the time of discharge he was ambulating without difficulty,
passing flatus and stool, tolerating a regular oral diet and his
incisions were healing well.  The remainder of his hospital
course was essentially uneventful. He continued to progress and
was cleared for discharge to home with VNA on POD 17. All follow
up appointments were advised.

History of Present Illness:
71-year-old man with AS undergoing CoreValve eval for critical
aortic stenosis, s/p complicated cardiac cath on [**7-10**] (hematoma)
groin p/w with CP and SOB s/p Intubation

Was at rehab after [**Hospital1 18**] admission (see below). On [**7-28**] he was
combative, delirious. On [**7-29**] he c/o CP and SOB. Sent to NVMC ED
with t98.3, HR 108, RR 18, BP 117/47, 84% on RA. He received
60mg IV lasix and BiPap. Admitted to a telemetry float. IV dapto
(600) and Gent (120) given. On [**7-30**], at 0120, he received 40mg
IV lasix for SOB and was intubated at 2am and started on
propofol. No vasopressors. CXR with ""extensive fluffy
infiltrates that appeared nodular"". ABG showed 7.35/40/94 on
100%Fi02, PEEP 5, TV 700 on AC at RR12. Net fluid balance was
800 negative. Cultures were drawn. WBC 6.7, Hbg 9.3, HCT 26.3,
plt 312. Na 132, K 3.6, Cl 94, HCO3 26, BUN 33, Cr 2.28 (from
1.86 overnight. ACE and BB were held due to ""soft"" blood
pressures. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU intubated on
propofol.

In the CCU, he was tachy to 130 and hypotensive to 90's. His CXR
yielded a diffuse patchy infiltrate. His PICC line transduced a
CVP of 9. He received 2.5 mg of metoprolol tartrate to bring
rate to 100. EKG was unchanged despite rate decrease with
precordial ST-depressions, AVR elevation. He received 500cc of
NS bolus (250 x 2). Propofol was dc'd.

LAST ADMISSION
Was admitted on [**7-10**] with Hematoma following cardiac
catheterization which disclosed RCA disease. He had ecchymoses
throughout right  groin, including swelling and discoloration of
genitals. Ultrasound revealed pseudoaneurysm of the femoral
artery with bleeding resolved by thrombin injection, confirmed
by US. The patient developed fever on [**2120-7-15**] and increased
oxygen requirement. 8/8 bottles were growing Enterococcus
faecalis as was his urine. TTE was without vegetation. He was
treated as endocarditis.  WBC scan showed a single focus near
posterior liver, may also be in pleural space, but no reason to
believe AAA graft was infected by scan. Infectious Disease was
consulted and started patient on regimen of daptomycin (patient
had anaphylaxis to Unasyn) and gentamicin. Within 48 hours, the
patient had defeveresced. His blood cultures from [**2120-7-16**] onward
were negative.

ASSORTED PROBLEMS DURING LAST ADMISSION
During an episode of oxygen desaturation, an EKG was checked,
which showed no ST or T wave changes. The patient had troponin
elevation (0.57), but CK-MB (2) resolved. Patient's Cr rose to
1.6 from 1.2 and later fell to 1.3 on discharge. Cardiac surgery
has declined AV replacement. Patient underwent CTA chest/CT
cardiac and PFTs as part of CoreValve work-up. Episodes of
abdominal pain with negative bloodtests. RUQ ultrasound ordered
for unclear indications and showed cholelithiasis without
cholecystitis.

IMAGING
TTE ([**2120-7-31**]):
FOCUSED VIEWS PRE/POST AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. No aortic regurgitation is seen prior to
valvuloplasty. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen after
valvuloplasty. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

KUB ([**2120-8-7**]):
1. No evidence of obstruction or ileus.
2. No evidence of free air on these supine radiographs.

CT HEAD ([**2120-8-8**])
IMPRESSION: Left parietal hypodensity extends to the cortex and
has an
appearance of subacute infarct of few days' duration. However,
clinical
correlation recommended. No hemorrhage seen

EEG ([**2120-8-9**])
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a
background
frequency asymmetry suggesting a large area of subcortical
abnormality
involving the left hemisphere. Additionally, the presence of a
slower
than normal background with bursts of generalized slowing is
consistent
with a mild to moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or
anoxic
etiology.

CTA HEAD/NECK ([**2120-8-11**])
IMPRESSION: Subacute-appearing infarct with some blood products
in the left parietal lobe. No acute infarct is seen. No mass
effect or hydrocephalus.  Note is made of decreased flow void in
the right cavernous carotid artery.
IMPRESSION: Right internal carotid artery has markedly
diminished flow. The internal carotid was described to be normal
on a previous duplex ultrasound on [**2120-7-15**]. Axial source images
do not give appearance of a dissection, but further evaluation
with CTA is recommended after consideration of patient's renal
insufficiency.
MPRESSION: Diminished flow signal in the right cavernous and
petrous carotid could be due to occlusion or markedly slow flow.


CAROTID U/S ([**2120-8-13**])
Right - nice brisk upstoke, minimal diastolic flow, diminuitive
ICA and potential dissection versus intracranial carotid
disease- CTA and clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 M with AS (0.8) and One vessel CAD p/w resp. distress that
prompted intubation. He is presently hypotensive, tachycardic
and profoundly hypoxic.
.
ACUTE ISSUES:
# Hypoxia - Patient arrived intubated after presenting to OSH
with SOB. Bilateral pulm infiltrates were severe and most
radiologically c/w pulm edema. However, the patient had fluid
responsive tachycardia and a low CVP (through the PICC). His
resp distress progressed despite lasix diuresis at NVMC.
Accordingly, initial differential included ARDS from sepsis (see
below), DAD, multifocal pna, flash pulmonary edema and
daptomycin pneumonitis. He was ventilated with ARDSnet settings.
 Pt was able to be weaned to minimal ventilator settings by day
8 of intubation.  However, extubation was delayed due to pt's
mental status.  Despite holding sedation for several days, pt
remained non-responsive.  He was successfully extubated on day
11 of intubation.  He successfully transitioned from nasal
canula to room air and has an oxygen saturation of 97-100% on
room air at time of discharge.
.
# Hypotension - Inital presentation with low CVP implies poor
preload implicating aortic stenosis as a cause. Tachycardia
improved with fluid boluses supporting poor preload.
Differential also included cardiac event, sepsis, PEEP effect
and propofol. Fluids and pressors were administered with goal
MAP > 60. Palliative valvuloplasty was attempted. TTE showed
post-valvuloplasty aortic valve area of 0.8cm2. He was
pan-cultured and initially continuted on vancomycin (gentomycin
was held given [**Last Name (un) **]).  He was successfully weaned off pressors
and maintained MAP >65.
.
# E. Faecalis infection:  Pt diagnosed with E.Faecalis on
previous admission and was discharged on dapto/gentamycin.  In
interim, pt developed [**Last Name (un) **] that was attributed to gentamycin
toxicity.  Dapto/gent was discontinued and he was started on
vancomycin (vanc sensitivity MIC of 2). Infectious Disease team
was consulted and per their recommendations, vancomycin was
discontinued due to risk of increasing kidney injury.  Pt was
resumed again on daptomycin.  Blood cultures remained negative
during this hospitalization.  He is to complete a 6 week course
of daptomycin for bacteremia (should be discontinued around
[**2120-8-28**] - however exact date of discontinuation should decided
at follow-up ID appointment on [**2120-8-20**]).
.
# UTI: Pt developed fever and leukocytosis during his ICU stay.
A UA demonstrated pyuria, and he grew Proteus resistant to cipro
but sensitive to ceftriaxone. He was started on ceftriaxone 1gm
daily for a 14 day course which should be completed on [**2120-8-29**].
.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Pt developed new onset paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation during hospitalization with heart rates up to 150s.
 He was rate controlled with IV and PO metoprolol.  He was
loaded with amiodarone and was started on anticoagulation with
heparin and coumadin.  He spontaneously converted back to sinus
rhythm and has remained in sinus for several days without any
recurrence of afib.  He was taken off heparin drip once INR was
theraputic at 2.0-3.0. He should be continued on amio 400 mg PO
daily for 1 week, and then decreased to maintenance dose of amio
200 mg PO daily.  His INR has been theraputic on coumadin 5mg PO
daily.
.
# Renal Failure - Pt presented with acute renal failure, thought
to be secondary to gentamicin use with a creatinine that peaked
at 3.7. Pt' severe respiratory distress was thought to be due to
volume overload so CVVH was initiated.  There were issues of
kinking with the CVVH catheter and the line had to be replaced
two times in order to achieve adequate flow. Pt tolerated CVVH
well with only one episode of hypotension thought to be related
to excessive fluid shifts during the CVVH. CVVH was discontinued
on [**8-5**] when pt began putting out good urine to IV Lasix. By the
end of his stay, pt was euvolemic, his creatinine was trending
down and he no longer required lasix.
.
# Altered Mental Status/Stroke - There was difficulty extubating
patient due to persistent mental status alteration. He was
inconsistently responsive to painful stimuli and failed to
respond to simple commands even though he had been quite alert
and interactive prior to his hospitalization. This altered
mental status was initially attributed to oversedation during
intubation so sedation was withheld for several days without any
improvement in mental status. Concern was then raised for
ischemic stroke given his recent episodes of atrial fibrillation
(see below). On exam, it was noticed that he seemed to had
clonus on his right side and appeared to have gaze preference to
the left. Neurology was consulted who recommended a CT Head and
MRI/MRA of the Head. CT Head showed left parietal hypodensity
extending to the cortex with an appearance of subacute infarct
of few days' duration. Follow-up MRI/MRA confirmed these
findings but also showed diminished flow in the right ICA. F/u
ultrasound of the carotids demonstrated intracranial dissection
on the right but per vascular surgery, no intervention is needed
and he can follow-up with vascular surgery in six months for
interval evaluation of any changes. However, he should be
further evaluated with CTA once his renal function improves.
Most likely etiology of the stroke is thrombus dislodged during
valvuloplasty or during pt's episodic episodes of atrial
fibrillation. After patient was successfully extubated, his
mental status improved significantly. He was alert and able to
follow commands consistently. He had a tremor in his face and
extremities (though this was present at baseline) and pt has an
expressive aphasia, able to answer questions only in short
sentences. Per neurology, pt is now exhibiting symptoms of
Parkinsonism but would defer treatment at this point.
.
# Diabetes: Pt continue to have elevated BG to 300s during ICU
stay.  He required insulin drip to manage his sugars.  [**Hospital **]
Clinic was consulted and pt was started on Lantus 45 units along
with sliding scale insulin as attached.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Aortic stenosis: Prior to admission pt was being evaluated for
CoreValve procedure, however evalution was complicated by
enterococcus infection.  Because of hypotension on presention,
palliative valvuloplasty was attempted but was not successful
because of technical difficulties.  Post-valvuloplasty aortic
area was 0.8cm2.  Volume status was monitored closely during
admission because pt is very preload depended.  Even if deemed
an appropriate candidate, he will not be eligable for CoreValve
for at least 6 months now given acute CVA.
.
# CAD: Pt continued on aspirin, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin
during hospitalization.
.
# Hypertension: Pt resumed on metoprolol once hypotension
resolved.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continue Rosuvastatin
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
He remained full code this admission.  Acute parietal infarct
has left pt with many residual deficits and will require intense
rehab and close follow-up with many specialties.

History of Present Illness:
34 year old female with asthma, GERD, post nasal drip, seizure
disorder and a history of congenital right lung hypoplasia [**1-30**]
tracheal-bronchial atresia and subglottic stenosis with history
of recurrent pneumonia, s/p tracheostomy in [**2100**], s/p
unsuccessful intrabronchial stent placement in [**2101-12-29**].
She has been lost to follow up with us since [**2101**]. In the mean
time she was being seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 12517**] [**Name (STitle) 16991**] at the Mass eye and
ENT infirmary. Since [**2101**] she had three tracheostomy tube
changed with laser ablation of the subglottic lesion. She had
the tracheostomy tube removed between [**2104**] and [**2105**] and has also
weaned off the oxygen.

Over the last three months she has been progressively more short
of breath with worsening stridor. She has had three pneumonia
over the last year, never needing admission to hospital. Treated
with Solu-Medrol and antibiotics including a antifungal. She has
also developed increasing DOE- she could climb one flight of
stairs, now she has to go very slow. The voice is more horse,
and noisy. She finds herself tired and fatigued. Cough is
productive of brown phlegm.

She underwent a scheduled rigid brochoscopy with balloon
dilation to her tracheal stenosis. Subsequently, she had
difficulty after extubation in the PACU. She develop stridor and
became agitated. She appear hypoxic and she was re-intubated,
which was proven to be difficult. She transciently became
bradycardic for <30 seconds, which improved with bag-mouth
ventalation. She recieved dexamethasone 5mg x 1 dose post-op.
Bronchoscopy was performed after re-intubation and no obvious
source of stridor was found. She is now being transfer to the
TSICU for further management.

CXR [**2110-8-7**]: AP single view of the chest was obtained with
patient in
semi-upright position.  The patient is intubated, the ETT is
seen to terminate in the trachea, 5 cm above the level of the
carina.  No pneumothorax or any other placement-related
complication can be identified.  An NG tube has been assed and
reaches well below the diaphragm including its side port.
External instruments and lines are overlying the right apical
area, but there is no evidence of any new pulmonary parenchymal
infiltrate anywhere in the lungs, and the lateral pleural
sinuses are free.  Skeletal structures grossly within normal
limits on this single view AP chest examination.  The next
preceding chest examination of this patient in our records is
dated [**2102-1-10**] and did not show any acute pulmonary
abnormalities.

CXR [**2110-8-10**]
FINDINGS:  The right IJ line has been removed.  There is no
focal infiltrate.
There is blunting of the right CP angle, consistent with small
effusion.
There is a linear lucency under the left hemidiaphragm that does
not conform
to the expected position of the stomach and is unclear if this
represents free
air.  This finding was called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13651**] at 4:20 p.m. on
[**2110-8-10**] after
noticing this finding at 4:18 p.m.  Recommend clinical
correlation and

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3924**] is a 34 yo F w/ extensive PMH included right lung
hypoplasia and multiple tracheostomy tubes with subsequent
tracheomalacia and subglotic stenosis who presented for an
outpatient elective rigid bronchoscopy with ballon dilation that
was complicated on extubation by likely laryngospasm with
stridor and reintubation who was reextubated successfully.

#Tracheo-bronchial atresia and Laryngospasm- patient had
striodor and respiratory distress following extubation from the
balloon dilation. A flexible bronchoscopy done in the PACU
showed some subglottic edema and the stenosis was patent.  She
was reintubated and admitted to the ICU.  There she received a
RIJ central line for access and ENT was consulted who performed
a fiberopstic evaluation where they did not see any evidence of
stenosis and it was felt to be most consistent with
laryngospasm.  She was treated with 24 hours of decadron and
then successfully extubated.  She was monitored by IP and will
require follow-up with them in the future to reassess her
hoarseness.

#Gastroesophageal reflux-stable
-continued on home omeprazole

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 3924**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were here at
[**Hospital1 18**].  You were admitted to the hospital after you had a
procedure to open up your trachea and you had some difficulty
breathing after the procedure. The breathing tube was placed
back in your throat and you were admitted to the ICU for a
couple of days and had the breathing tube removed. It is felt
that the problem breathing was likely due to a spasm of the
muscles in your throat.  You are now safe to go home.

We made the following changes to your medications:
Prednisone 60mg on [**9-28**], 40mg on [**9-21**], 20mg on [**7-20**], 10mg on [**7-17**]
Bactrim 1 tablet daily

Followup Instructions:
Your pulmonologist will call you for a follow up appointment in
3 to 4 weeks.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2137-12-28**]  8:54:32 PM
Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block. Inferolateral T
wave
abnormalities are non-specific but cannot exclude ischemia.
Since the previous
tracing of [**2137-12-17**] sinus bradycardia is absent. Clinical
correlation is
suggested.

[**12-28**] CXR
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. Probable trace right
pleural effusion.

[**12-31**] TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2135**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

[**2138-1-1**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
one vessel CAD. The LMCA, LAD and LCX had no angiographically
apparent
flow limiting disease. The RCA had a calcified ostial 95% lesion
with
left to right collaterals to the distal RCA.
2.  Successful rotational atheretomy, PTCA and stenting of the
ostial
RCA with two overlapping Cypher (3x18mm distal; 3.5x13mm) drug
eluting
stents postdilated distally with a 3.25mm balloon and 3.5mm
balloon
proximally.  Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically
apparent
dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout
the vessel
(See PTCA comments).
3.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a Mynx
closure device.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic arterial
hypertension, with BP of 180/72 mmHg.
5. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atheretomy, PTCA and stenting of the
ostial RCA
with two overlapping Cypher drug eluting stents.
3. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
a Mynx
closure device.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 55 yo F was admitted with a right brainstem bleed, thought
to be secondary to extreme hypertension. No AVM or cavernoma was
appreciated on MRI/MRA. Pt was initially treated in the ICU,
where she developed a LLL PNA, treated with Augmentin and
Flagyl. She also developed jaundice to propofol and was sedated
instead with versed. She initally failed swallow eval and had an
NG tube which remained until [**2133-6-15**] when she pulled it out,
however, susbequent repeat swallow eval suggested she could
tolerate oral nutrition.
Pt's BP originally controlled with labetalol gtt, but then
placed on oral regimen of labetalol, lisinopril, and HCTZ.
Systolic BP's are running 130-180, and titration of her BP meds
is ongoing.
Symptomatically, she showed significant improvement, becoming
drowsy with improved HA and nausea. Eye movements continued to
improve, although on discharge she still has some dysconjugate
gaze, giving her what appears as a partial one-and-a-half
syndrome. Her vertigo is also significantly improved, however,
she still experiences dizziness on standing and has trouble
taking more than a few steps without feeling like she is going
to fall. She is continuing to work with PT/OT, and was
discharged to rehab facility on [**2133-6-19**]

History of Present Illness:
83yo with a history DM, HTN, and MI with RCA stenting in [**2127**]
arrived to ED by ambulance after 1 hr of substernal chest pain
that came on while shoveling snow at approximately 11am this
morning.  Upon arrival to the ED he was found to have ST
elevations in V1-V5 with ST depressions in  II, III, AvF and Q
waves in v1-V5 and new RBB.  He was urgently taken to cardiac
cath where he was found to have complete acute occlusion of the
proximal LAD with an completely occluded RCA and 90% occluded
circumflex. After angioplasty flow was recovered in the LAD and
a stent was placed.  During the procedure the patient had
multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and underwent
electrocardioversion several times and started on amiodarone. He
vomitted and was intubated. He became hypotensive and was
started on dopamine 15mcg/kg.  Post procedure PCWP was 40 mm/Hg
with V waves to 80.  Bedside echo showed an VEF of 20-25% with
3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 6**] aortic balloon pump was not placed because he has a
tortuous aorta.
During the procedure he received over 600cc of contrast and was
given 40mg of lasix.

ROS: Per wife,  cardiac review of systems is notable for two
weeks of fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and presyncope. No chest
pain before today's acute event. Also no paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, or palpitations.

#ECHO on [**2-21**]: LVEF = 20% ; 3+ MR ;
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the anterior wall, septum, distal LV segments
and apex. There is hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
20%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen (no
papillary muscle rupture or frank prolapse seen). There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
#Cardiac Catheterization on [**2137-2-21**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
3 vessel CAD. The LMCA had no obstruction. The LAD was flush
occluded
proximallly. The LCX had an 80% mid lesion adn an 80% OM1. The
RCA was
occluded in the mid vessel and filled distally via collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and
right sided
filling pressures, cardiogenic shock with a PCWP of 40 with V
waves to
55.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a
overlapping
2.5 x 18 and 2.5 x 12 mm minivision stents which were post
dilated with
a 3.0 x 15 mm Quantum balloon. Final angiography revealed no
residual
stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
5. Acute anterior STEMI, cardiogenic shock and VT requiring
defibrillation/pacing for heart block.

#Cardiac Catheterization on [**3-1**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
stent
thrombosis within the previously placed proximal LAD distal BMS.
The
LMCA had no significant disease. The LAD stents were patent with
a
distal filling defect and probable stent underexpansion with
stent
thrombosis. The LCX was unchanged from prior. The RCA was not
engaged.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial
pressures with
an SBP of 120 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. Successful balloon angioplasty of the LAD stents with a 2.75
balloon
with no residual stenosis, defect or dissection.

# [**2-28**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale
and Doppler
examination of the bilateral common femoral, superficial
femoral, and
popliteal veins was performed.  There is a deep venous
thrombosis in the right
superficial femoral vein extending all the way down to the
popliteal vein with
intraluminal clot expanding the vein and absence of flow
consistent with
complete occlusion.  The right common femoral vein is patent.
There is no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the left leg.
IMPRESSION:  DVT on the right extending from the superficial
femoral vein to the popliteal vein.

# [**3-4**] V/Q scan: Low probability

# [**3-4**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Mild CHF with small pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**], anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2
overlapping BMS to proximal LAD, anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with
stent thrombosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI.

# CAD/Ischemia:  Status post STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**],
anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD,
anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with stent thrombosis.  Patient presented
with anterior STEMI with ST elevations V1-V4 and ST depressions
in II III and aVf.  By cardiac angiography he was found to have
completely occluded proximal LAD, 80% occlusion of the Lcx and
complete proximal occlusion of the RCA with distal flow from
collaterals. The LAD lesion was opened by angioplasty and a bare
metal stent was placed.  During the procedure the patient became
hypotensive with episodes of V Tach and V fib requiring multiple
cardioversions.  After emesis he was intubated for airway
protection. He was then transfered to the CCU and started on
[**Month/Day/Year **], plavix, and heparin. On [**2137-3-1**] pt developed chest pain
while at rest and was found to have anterior ST elevations in
V1-V3. He was treated with nitroglycerin, O2, and morphine which
resulted in alleviation of his symptoms. At cardiac
catheterization he was found to have an LAD stent thrombosis
that was opened with balloon angioplasty resulting in improved
flow through the LAD stent.  He remains on Toprol XL 25mg daily,
[**Last Name (LF) 17339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Plavix daily.
.
# Pump: At presentation the patient developed cardiogenic shock
and was found to have a PCWP of 40 with VEF 20% by echo with 3+
MR, and septal and anterolateral ventricular akenesis.  An IABP
was not used becasue the patient has a tortutous aorta.  He was
initially started on dopamine. In the first 24 hours post cath
he developed several episodes of sinus bradycardia and
hypotension when attempting to wean down the dopamine that
required atropine boluses on one occasion. He was transitioned
to levophed on [**2-23**]. Metoprolol was started on [**2-24**]. After
maintaining pressure well he taken off levophed on [**2-26**]. On [**3-1**]
he developed dyspnea and appeared fluid overloaded on clinical
exam and has begun on Lasix for diuresis.  On the day of
discharge the lasix dose was increased to 80mg daily.  This can
be titrated based on fluid status and blood pressure parameters.
 ACE-I/ARBs was held due to concerns for renal function; if
renal function recovers to baseline, we would strongly
recommended ACE inhibitor therapy for decreased EF. Will need to
have creatinine and potassium checked in 2 days at rehab
facility. Needs strict intake/output measurement along with
daily weights.
.
# Rhythm: During cardiac catherization patient had ventricular
tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that required multiple
cardioversions to regain perfusing rhythm. At that time he was
then started on amiodarone drip.  He was transfered to the CCU
in NSR and the amiodarone was discontinued.  On [**2-23**] and then
again on [**2-24**] he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular repsonse in the context of attempted ventilator
weens.  Both episodes were treated with amiodarone and
metoprolol and he returned to NSR. Since [**2-24**] he has been in NSR
on daily metropolol and amiodarone.  He is also on coumadin.
Coumadin dose was held on [**3-25**] for supratherapeutic INR.
Plan is to restart coumadin on [**3-6**], INR on [**3-5**] at the time of
discharge was 3.1, was receiving a dose of 5mg, patient was
being loaded on amiodarone. The dose of amiodarone will be
decreased and it is reasonable to initiate warfarin at 5mg and
check frequent INR level to ensure he is not supratherapeutic
and adjust as necessary.
.
# Respiratory: During cardiac arrest the patient vomitted and
was intubated for airway protection.  He was removed from
mechanical ventilation on [**2-25**]. Since, he has used up to 3L O2
by nasal canula after patient reported subjective dyspnea though
he has maintained 02 saturations above 95%.  After ecoli was
found in a sputum culture he completed a course of
ciprofloxacin. He has had episodes of dyspnea with elvated JVP
and lower extremity edema, and signs of CHF on CXR;  Diuresis
with lasix was begun on [**3-1**].  The dose was uptitrated from 40mg
PO lasix to 80mg PO lasix based on increased pulmonary edema on
CXR.  VQ scan was low probability for pulmonary embolism on
[**3-4**].

# CKD: Cr 1.4-1.8 at baseline. During initial cardiac
catheterization he received  600cc dye load and  had episodes of
hypotension. He arrived to the CCU with a Non AG acidosis of
unclear etiology that resolved over the next several days. His
Cr peaked on [**2-23**] at 4.4 and then declined steadily declined to
2.4 on [**3-4**] despite receiving another 60cc dye load on [**3-1**].  He
never required HD, although renal consult team followed closely.
He will need renal follow up as an outpatient.

# DVT: Despite therapeutic heparin levels, patient developed a
right sided femoral to popliteal DVT discovered on ultrasound on
[**2-28**]. As mentioned above VQ scan was negative. He was maintained
on heparin and then transitioned to coumadin. Because of DVT
despite heparin for ACS on presentation and antiplatelet therapy
peri-MI as well as in-stent thrombosis on adequate antiplatelet
therapy, concern for hypercoagulable state is high and pt should
have full hypercoagulable work up once other issues are stable.
.
# R arm cellulitis: In addition he developed an infiltrated
right forearm venous access site that became ecchymotic and
tender and was presumptive treated with cefelaxin for concern of
a possible cellulitis.
.
# BPH: Restarted on Flomax on day of discharge.

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71415**] is a 74M w/DM on glyburide, renal xplant in [**2105**] [**1-26**]
hereditary nephritis, lymphoma 9ya s/p RCHOP, SCC scalp excised
in [**2120-6-23**], afib on flecainide, MS, circumcision last week who
presented to the ED w/2 days of hypoglycemia, also found to have
low BP.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 71415**] is not aware of why he is in the hospital.  He is able
to describe frequent falls [**1-26**] MS which increased over [**Holiday **]
and New Years.  He denies vertigo with the falls, but does
report decreased streadiness when his blood sugars are low.  He
takes his own medications and his list is extensive as below.
.
He presented to [**Hospital 882**] hospital yesterday with mental status
changes, BG18 and hyopthermia.  His urinalysis was negative at
that time and he was sent home.  He returned w/hypoglycemia and
was thus transferred to BDIMC.  In our ED, his VS were 100.6
104/58  80  98RA w/next BP 86/50.  He was given 1L NS, 1/2A D50,
D10 drip and levofloxacin.  At the time of transfer to the CCU
under MICU service, his BP was 89/63 and FS142.
.
His ROS is notable for the falls, dysphagia to solid foods for
years, mild dysphagia, and recent GI ilness (upper and lower) of
his wife for a few weeks; he had similar symptoms for several
days two weeks ago.  While he gives some detailed history, his
answers to many questions are tangential and circumstantial, and
in response to being asked why he is here, he describes a
vacation that he took with his wife to [**Name2 (NI) **] five years ago,
and her diarrheal ilness.  His PCP reports that this is baseline
for him.  His wife reports that he takes all of his own
medications, and does not typically make mistakes.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
74M w/MMP as above admitted w/hyoglycemia, hypotension, and
low-grade fever 13d s/p circumcision.  It is not clear if his
glyburide was recently increased--this could be a primary
contributor to his presentation.  He has an evident ballantitis
which could also be contributing.
.
1) Hypoglycemia- Thought to be most likely [**1-26**] glyburide in the
context of recent illness and polypharmacy.  On the evening
following admission, his blood glucose levels were maintained at
normal levels with D51/2NS gtt titrated to q1 hour fingersticks.
 Glyburide's half life is 24 hours, and in keeping with this,
hypoglycemic effect wore out within 24 hours of admission.
Subsequently blood glucose levels were >200 and the dextrose
support was discontinued.  With the resolution of hypoglycemia,
sliding scale insulin was initiated.  After transfer from the
MICU, the patient had blood sugars > 250.  He was started on low
dose glipizide prior to discharge.  Although Glipizide still has
some interaction with voriconazole, it has less interaction that
Glyburide.  The patient had been on Glyburide and Voriconazole
for many years prior to this episode of hypoglycemia and it was
not clear why the patient had hypoglycemia.  The Glipizide was
started back after the patient was found to have blood sugars in
the 250 range.  He will be seen by his primary care doctor
shortly after discharge for further titration of meds.
.
2) UTI- The patient was started on IV ceftriaxone which would
cover both his UTI and balantitis.  Culture results were
negative.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin.
.
3) Balantitis- Patient was found to have balanitis after recent
circumcision approximately 2 weeks prior to this admission.  A
swab gram stain negative.  The wound culture was found to grown
Diptheroids (Corynebacterium) and Coag Negative Staph consistent
with skin floral.  The patient was continued on a topical
antifungal as well as IV Ceftriaxone.  Additionally, a DFA was
negative for HSV.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin
and will followup with his [**Hospital1 2025**] Urologist.
.
4) Thrombocytopenia:  Thought to be [**1-26**] drug effect of
voriconazole vs. ranitidine; however, per PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**], he has had
baseline thrombocytopenia.  Thrombocytopenia has been mentioned
as a rare side effect of vori, but per ID's assessment of risks
vs. benefits, would not stop Voriconazole.  At [**Hospital1 18**], patient's
ranitidine was stopped to see what effect it would have on
platelets.  Patient's platelets rose from 60s-80s at baseline to
112, making Ranitidine a possible cause of the patient's
thrombocytopenia.  The patient was instructed not to take
Ranitidine anymore.  He will followup at [**Hospital1 2025**] for further
monitoring of his thrombocytopenia.
.
5) Pulmunary aspergillosis- The patient was continued on
lifelong voriconazole therapy for history of pulmonary
aspergillosis.
.
6) Thrush- Patient was thought to have evidence of oral thrush
upon admission to the MICU.  He was continued on voriconazole
and nystatin S&S was added to his regimen.  He had no further
evidence of thrush upon transfer to the floor from the MICU.
.
7) Afib/SSS- Has PPM but currently native sinus driven.  The
patient was anticoagulated with warfarin.  Flecainide was
continued as per his outpatient regimen.
.
8) S/P renal xplant- Patient was continued on his
immunosupressives, Tacrolimus.  He was continued on Bactrim for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  He will followup with his renal doctor at [**Hospital3 5870**] upon discharge.

Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy with embolization
Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88527**] is a 46-year-old man with no significant PMH who
presented on [**2172-11-20**] to an OSH with a chief complaint of
hemoptysis. He reported that on [**2172-11-19**] he was woken up by
coughing and coughed up about half a cup of bright red blood. He
had a second episode of hemoptysis on [**2172-11-20**] and presented to
OSH ED. Because the pt had several episodes of hemoptysis (and
one in the ED) the pt was admitted for bronchoscopy. On [**2172-11-20**]
the pt was taken for bronchoscopy which was unable to be
performed due to difficulties with sedation, and a significant
amount of periglottic edema. The pt was then taken to the OR for
bronchoscopy under genearal anesthesia and endotracheal
intubation, and during the procedure a fresh clot was visualized
in the left lingula, which, when gently disturbed, produced
brisk bleeding. Due to the extent of bleeding patient was left
intubated and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
46 yo M with history of ETOH abuse transferred to MICU from OSH
for hemoptysis, now s/p lingular AVM bleed and IR embolization,
with ICU course complicated by MICU [**Hospital 16630**] transferred to floor
with resolving fever and confusion.

Active Issues:

# Hemoptysis:  PE ruled out on CTA at OSH. Fungal markers
negative. Evidence of bleeding on bronch after two evaluations
thought [**1-14**] AVM. Pt is s/p IR embolization of left bronchial
artery without hemopytysis since the [**11-23**]. [**Hospital1 1562**] rheum
testing: all negative ([**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, ESR, CRP). Anti GBM negative.
He was transferred to the floor on [**12-5**].  He will need to have
IP follow up in 1 month.

# Respiratory distress/MRSA VAP: Patient transferred intubated
because of hemoptysis. Patient self-extubated on [**2172-11-25**] and
continued to oxygenate well, but on morning rounds [**11-26**] pt
tachypneic, with pO2 on gas 74 on 6L NC O2 and required
reintubation. Concern for multifocal pneumonia on CT. Patient
was initially covered with Vanc/Zosyn. The zosyn was changed to
Aztreonam given rash. Scopalamine patch trialed on [**11-30**] for
copious oral secretions, but this was ineffective. Sputum
culture + for MRSA. Successfully extubated on [**12-3**].  Vancomycin
course completed in [**2172-12-7**] after 14 days.

# Delirium: Active in MICU, out of window for ETOH withdrawal.
Two days after extubation, there was no evidence of withdrawal
but still had mild confusion with confabulation. Pt continued on
thiamine. CT head, TSH, B12, RPR normal. He continued to perform
poorly on his mental status examination, however this was felt
most likely secondary to his long and heavy alcohol abuse.

# Diarrhea: Started in MICU in setting of abx, cdiff negative,
resolved on own.

# Maculopapular rash: over extremities, chest and back, thought
[**1-14**] zosyn which has been discontinued, mother with [**Name2 (NI) **] allergy,
consider [**Name2 (NI) **] an allergy.

#Thrombocytosis: Likely reaction to infection.

# Alcoholism: drinks 6 beers/day, did not withdrawl, no desire
to quit, started on mvi, folate, thiamine.

# elevated INR: Likely in setting of poor nutrition, improved to
1.3 on discharge.

#. [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to dye load received with IR for
embolization. Improved throughout hospitalization with IVF.

# Anemia: Likely [**1-14**] to blood loss from hemoptysis, should be
followed as outpatient

# ALT elevation: Likely chronic, outpatient f/u.

***********
Inactive Issues:
# Smoking: cessation counseling performed, patient does not
desire to quit

Ventilator-associated pneumonia
Anemia
Confusion possibly from Wernicke's

Secondary Diagnosis:
Alcohol Abuse


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the ICU after coughing up blood.  You
needed to have a breathing tube placed in [**Hospital1 1562**] in order to
protect your airway.  You were then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  You
underwent a procedure in the OR to stop the bleeding, called
embolization.  Following the procedure, you were monitored in
the ICU for recurrent episodes of bleeding, which you did not
have.  You developed a pneumonia while in the hospital, and
received antiobiotics to treat the pneumonia.  You improved and
were transferred to the floor. On the floor, you had some low
grade fevers that improved on their own.  You also had some
confusion that was improving upon discharge. You were seen by
the physical therapist who felt you were safe to go home.

Medication changes:
1)We started you on a multivitamin, folic acid, and thiamine to
take every day.

Followup Instructions:
Please call to schedule an appointment with the interventional
pulmonologists within the next month. Phone: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17398**]

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue for one week. Transferred to CCU with hypoxic distress
in context of AF with RVR, developed PNA and transferred to MICU
with stabilized AF.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70654**] is a 75M with a history of coronary artery disease
s/p CABG x3 ([**University/College **] Presbyterian NY, [**2145**]), PTCA x2 stents
(DES: proximal LAD and SVG to PDA, [**2156**]) as well as
assymptomatic PAF on coumadin who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-4-21**]
with fatigue for the last 5 days. He did not endorse shortness
of breath or chest pain, only generalized fatigue. Other ROS
were negative and notable for the absence of fevers, chills,
productive cough, sick contacts, recent travel or other
complaints.

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.8 65 132/78 16 97. CXR showed a
small new right pleural effusion. EKG showed atrial fibrillation
at a rate of 114, and ST depression II, III, AVf, V4-V6. He was
given Aspirin and placed on Oxygen. Cardiac biomarkers were
negative x 3. He was loaded with dofetilide for chemical
cardioversion of his a fib and went into NSR after the first
dose. The following morning he developed worsening dyspnea and
was found to be hypoxic with O2 sats in the 70s on RA. He
triggerred for hypoxia and was found to have expiratory wheezes
and crackles at the base. Chest x-ray showed severe scoliosis
and opacities within both lower lobes. VBG showed pH 7.42, pO2
53, pCo2 30. He was placed on a non-rebreather with O2 sats that
returned to 92%. The team felt that his symptoms were either CHF
versus pneumonia, with CHF more likely because he did not have a
white count or fever at the time. He was diuresed with 20 mg IV
lasix x 3 and had 2 L of urine output. He remained on the
non-rebreather throughout the afternoon despite the diuresis. He
was given nebulizers and ordered doxycycline and augmentin for
possible community acquired pneumonia (although he did not
receive antibiotics). At 6:30 pm nightfloat came to evaluate the
patient and was concerned. An ABG showed pH 7.42 pO2 66 and pCO2
54. Vanc and cefipime were started and the CCU was called to
evaluate the patient.

The patient was found to be tachypneic and uncomfortable, using
increase work of breathing. He was sating 92% on the
non-rebreather. He was transferred for hypoxic respiratory
distress. In the CCU he endorsed chills, but denied fever, chest
pain, palpitations, nausea, cough, abdominal pain, HA, dysuria,
myalgias, melena.

Respiratory status continued to be tenuous in the CCU requiring
face mask during the day, and BiPap overnight. Patient was not
intubated due to concerns about ability to wean from the vent.
He was treated empirically with broad spectrum.

CCU course notable for increasing respiratory distress requiring
BiPap for comfort. Initially used overnight only with face mask
during the day but increasingly requiring BiPap. Was seen by his
outpatient pulmonologist who agreed with current plan, and felt
patient likely to be difficult to wean from the vent if
intubated. +6L LOS (not counting insensible losses). Admission
weight 53.1kg, currently weighs 56.1 kg(but unreliable as bed
weight with sheets etc). Patient had intermittent A. Fib with
RVR requiring boluses of diltiazem for rate control.

Other Reports

EKG [**2159-4-21**]
Atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions and
uncontrolled ventricular response. Compared to tracing #2 the
heart rate is faster.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
114 0 104 330/424 0 16 -164

CXR [**2159-4-21**]
COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest radiographs from [**2157-1-5**],
[**2157-3-2**], and [**2159-1-17**]. CTA chest was performed on [**2157-3-10**].
CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: The patient is status
post median sternotomy, CABG, and coronary artery stenting.
Severe scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, with deformity of
the left rib cage, again limits evaluation. Left lung volume is
chronically small. Left pleural thickening with calcification is
as before. On the right, there is small pleural effusion which
is new since [**2159-1-17**]. There may be subtle ill-defined opacity
in the right lung base. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
Cardiac enlargement is unchanged.
IMPRESSIONS: Evaluation limited by spine and ribcage deformity.
New small right pleural effusion and subtle opacity in the right
lung base, which could represent aspiration, atelectasis, and/or
developing consolidation.

Echo [**2159-4-23**]
  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
  Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2158-6-13**], no definite change.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2156-10-4**] demonstrated:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated a normal LMCA with collaterals to RPL. The LAD had
a 90% proximal lesion with competitive flow. The LCX system had
an occluded
OM. The RCA was not selectively engaged.
2. Graft angiography showed a patent SVG to diagonal and OM. The
SVG to RPDA had a 99% proximal stenosis.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics as detailed above revealed
mildly
elevated filling pressures.
4. PCI of SVG-RPDA with 3.5 X 28 mm Cypher DES and no residual
stenosis or complications (see PTCA comments for detail).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-diagonal-OM graft.
3. Proximal stenosis of SVG-RCA, successful PCI with Cypher
drug-eluting stent.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2156-10-6**] demonstrated:
1. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with 2.5 X 13 Cypher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.0 with no residual stenosis.
2. Distal LAD myocardial bridge with compression during systole
but
normal flow at diastole.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with Cypher DES.

CXR [**2159-4-22**]
IMPRESSIONS: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from
[**2159-4-21**]. Study is markedly limited due to patient
positioning and the severe scoliosis. Allowing for this,
however, there appears to be opacities within both lower lobes
which are worrisome for consolidation or pneumonia. The
consolidations on the right side are much more apparent than on
the study from yesterday. Aspiration cannot be excluded.

CXR [**2159-4-27**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the volume of
the right hemithorax has decreased. As a consequence, there is
increased crowding of the right perihilar vessels. However,
there is no clear evidence of pneumonia (the film strongly
resembles the examination performed on [**2159-4-24**], 8:03
a.m.). Unchanged marked asymmetry of the chest wall given the
extreme scoliosis. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.

CT chest [**2159-4-28**]
1. Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent
telectasis/consolidation.
2. Scattered ground-glass opacities with enlarged heart. These
findings are most likely representative of pulmonary edema.
3. Calcified left pleural plaques consistent empyema.
4. Prominent abdominal vessels are limited due to lack of
intravenous
contrast but suggestive of varices. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
5. Marked thoracic cage distortion due to scoliosis.

Pleural fluid [**2159-4-29**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

CXR [**2159-5-10**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are
unchanged. Presence of a minimal right-sided pleural effusion
cannot be
excluded. Minimally increased diameters of the pulmonary vessels
in the right upper lobe could indicate mild overhydration.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged aspect of
the left lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course
Professor [**Known lastname 70654**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and coronary artery disease who presented with 5
days of fatigue and was found to be in Atrial fibrillaton with
RVR. Patient was admitted to the cardiology service and
dofetilide was initiated given atrial fibrillation. On HD#1
patient develope hypoxic respiratory distress reguiring transfer
to the CCU where he was treated for community acquired pneumonia
with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Doxycycline given concern for QT
prolongatoin. During his stay in the CCU he was intermittently
in atrial fibrillation with RVR and would intermittently develop
respiratory distress reguiring BiPap.  Patient was eventually
transferred to the MICU for more intensive management of his
pulmonary issues. There the patient completed his course of
antibiotics and was diuresed. Slowly the patients breathing
improved and on [**5-4**] was transfered to the general medical
floor.

Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:
On presentation to the hospital patient was at baseline
pulmonary status. Initial CXR with question of RLL opacity. On
HD#1 patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure which
[**Hospital 70655**] transfer to the CCU and broad spectrum antibiotics to
treat RLL pneumonia visualized on CXR. Further patient became
febrile prior to transfer. Initially patient was thought to have
RLL infiltrate c/w pneumonia and high fever. Patient was treated
for probable RLL pneumonia with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and
Doxycycline completing an 8 day course. On transfer to the MICU
the patient appeared to have superimposed pulmonary edema from
volume resuscitation as evidenced by LOS fluid balance, interval
weight, and clinical exam.  MICU attempted low dose lasix
overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitored respiratory status,
with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT
showed moderate right sided pleural effusion. Based upon
patient's respiratory distress, he underwent a 1.5L
thoracentesis on [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory
status. Patient has limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy
and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes of
fluid. A Urine legionella was negative. Blood cultures negative
(finalized). Sputum cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid
appeared transudative and cultures NGTD. The patient was
maintained on nebulizers as needed. The patient underwent
aggressive diuresis with IV lasix and was negative
approximately 6 liters for his MICU stay (though even from
admission weight). The patient initially required BiPap around
the clock.  He was weaned to a shovel mask and eventually to a
nasal cannula with diuresis.  He continued on BiPap at night
with his home settings. Based upon radiographic images, there
was concern that patient may be aspirating.  He was evaluated by
speech and swallow who cleared the patient for solids and thin
liquids; pills whole with puree. After diuresis patient
continued to improve, no longer needing BiPAP during the day.
Patient was transferred to the general medical floor where
diuresis was continued. The patient was maintained on nasal
cannula 1-2L for a week, and finally weaned down to RA, satting
mid90s on discharge. The patient was discharged on Lasix and
Aldactone.

Atrial fibrillation:
On admission to the hospital patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation. With therapeutic INRs for the past two months.
Decision was made to start dofetilide. Patient initially
converted to sinus rhythm prior to transfer to CCU. During CCU
stay patient was paroxysmally in atrial fibrillation which was
intermittently controlled with diltiazem.  The patient was
continued on dofetilide per EP recommendations, and daily EKGs
were initially obtained to monitor for QT prolongation.  The
patient's diltiazem was up-titrated as tolerated.  At the time
of leaving the MICU, he was on Diltiazem Extended Release 240mg
PO BID.  He was in sinus rhythm. On the floor, the patient was
intermittently in afib. He was started on Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
for better heart rate control. He was intermittently in afib and
junction rhythm (rate 60s-80s). Dofetilide was discontinued on
[**5-14**]. He was discharged on Dilt 240mg PO BID, Metoprolol 25mg PO
BID.

Metabolic alkalosis:
Thought to be secondary to aggressive diuresis with lasix
(contraction alkalosis). Correction may help respiratory status
by preventing compensatory hypoventilation. On his last day in
the MICU, he was started on acetazolamide 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].

Junctional Bradycardia:
Likely secondary to beta-blockers.  The patient was started on
Metoprolol, as recommended by EP. The patient was noted to be in
a junctional rhythm, but was not bradycardic.

Coronary artery disease:
post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST depressions on EKG (stable, but
worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No active chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes negative. The patient was continued on aspirin
81 mg and his home dose Lipitor.

Hypernatremia:
The patient was intermittently hypernatremic while in the MICU,
most recently with Na 146 on [**5-4**] free water deficit of 1.4L. He
intermittently received D5W X 1000 cc and PO intake was
encouraged.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 70654**],
.
It was a pleasure caring for you while you were hospitalized
with fatigue and shortness of breath. During your stay your
breathing became extremely labored [**Hospital 70656**] transfer to the
Intensive Care Unit were you were treated with antibiotics for
pneumonia. While in the ICU your breathing was slow to improve
so you were also diuresed with IV diuretics (lasix). Slowly your
breathing improved and you were transfered to regular medical
floor. Throughout this time your heart rate was in and out of
atrial fibrillation. Electrophysiology recommended Diltiazem and
Metoprolol for good rate control. You were also on Dofetilide
which was stopped since it did not keep you in a normal heart
rhythm.
.
Please take all your medications as prescribed and keep all of
your follow up appointments. Weigh yourself every morning, and
call your physician if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. You
should also have lab work checked at your visit on [**2159-5-18**] to
ensure your kidney function and electrolytes are normal.
.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
#. CHANGE Atenolol to Metoprolol 25mg by mouth twice daily
#. STOP Nifedipine
#. START Diltiazem 240mg by mouth twice daily
#. START Miconazole powder twice a day as needed for you groin
rash
#. Start Lasix 20mg daily on [**2159-5-17**] (Call PCP and stop if you
feel lightheaded or dizzy)
#. Start Aldactone 12.5mg daily on [**2159-5-17**] )Call PCP and stop if
you feel lightheaded or dizzy)

CXR [**6-13**]
Moderate right pleural effusion with right lung base
consolidation. Smaller opacification likely pneumonia at the

treatment.
.
U/S [**6-14**]
Satisfactory morphologic appearance of both kidneys with no
evidence of
hydronephrosis, renal mass or shadowing calculi.
The bladder is empty containing an indwelling Foley catheter.
.
ECHO [**2134-6-16**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a very small,
predominantly anterior pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No
IMPRESSION: Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No significant valvular disease. No valvular
vegetations identified.
.
KUB [**2134-6-16**]
IMPRESSION:  Paucity of abdominal gas without evidence of toxic
megacolon.
.
U/S [**6-19**]
1.  Distended gallbladder containing layering sludge without
definite stones.  No gallbladder wall edema.  Though no specific
signs of cholecystitis are present, acute acalculous
cholecystitis cannot be excluded.
2.  Uniform dilation of the extrahepatic common duct, up to 1.0
cm, to the
level of the pancreatic head, below which the duct is not seen
well.  MRCP may be helpful for further evaluation if there is
clinical concern. If not
obtained LFTs should be followed.
3.  Small amount of ascites.
.
DOPPLER U/S
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  Cephalic vein
(superficial) thrombosis at the level of the antercubital fossa.

.
CXR [**7-1**]
There is a new tracheostomy tube in standard position.  Right IJ
catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Mild vascular
congestion is increased.  Bibasilar opacities are unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also stable.  There is no
evident pneumothorax.  The opacities in the lower lobes may
reflect atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be
totally excluded.
.
MRI [**2134-6-30**]
FINDINGS:  Diffusion images demonstrate multiple small areas of
restricted
diffusion in both cerebral hemispheres, predominantly in the
subcortical white matter in the periventricular region including
involvement of the left side of the corpus callosum suggestive
of acute infarcts.  There are no acute infarcts seen in the
brainstem or cerebellum.  Mild brain atrophy is seen.  Mild
changes of small vessel disease identified.  Small amount of
fluid is seen in the left sphenoid sinus and bilateral mastoid
air cells.  There is no evidence of chronic microhemorrhages.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple acute subcortical infarction in both
cerebral
hemispheres as described above.  No mass effect or
hydrocephalus.

EEG [**6-29**]
This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of
intermittent runs of bifrontocentral rhythmic slowing. In
addition,
there is excess slow activity admixed with background. These
findings
are indicative of a diffuse mild to moderate encephalopathy of
non-
specific etiology. If clinical suspicion for seizure is high, a
24
hour bedside EEG monitoring is recommended. No epileptiform
discharges
or electrographic seizures are present.

EEG [**6-30**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The
background was often disorganized and included a fair amount of
drowsiness. There were also brief bursts of slowing seen
multifocally,
especially in the right frontal region, but there were no areas
of
persistent and prominent focal slowing. There were no definitely

epileptiform features. There were no electrographic seizures.

[**7-1**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The
recording showed a disorganized background, but one that reached
normal
frequencies. Much of the recording reflected drowsiness or early
sleep.
There was some slowing in several areas, but none was permanent.
There
were no epileptiform features, and there were no seizures.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
70 y/o female without significant past medical history who
presented initially with 4 days of cough, malaise, fever at home
dx with pneumonia via xray, admitted to MICU for increased O2
demand and acute kidney injury. Ultimately intubated for
respiratory distress and found to have Pneumococcal sepsis w/
course c/b MODS.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
Likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of underlying COPD,
thus minimal reserve. Patient had progressive increasing work of
breathing ultimately requiring intubation. This was further
complicated by the development of ARDS in the setting of septic
shock, and pulmonary edema from fluid resuscitation. Her
pneumonia was treated with antibiotics (see below) and she
diuresis was started once she was HD stable. Her respiratory
status slowly improved. However, there was concern that due to
critical illness myopathy and resulting poor inspiratory effort,
she would be at high risk of re-intubation. A tracheostomy was
performed on [**6-30**]. Prior to discharge the patient was off the
ventilator with normal saturation on trach mask at FIO2 of 40%.
.
# Pneumosepsis:
Patient presented with leukopenia, bandemia, tachycardia and
tachypnea. Her CXR initially showed RLL infiltrate but evolved
quickly to involve both lungs. She shortly thereafter became
hypotensive and was aggressively fluid repleted and temporarily
required vasopressors. Her blood cultures from OSH prior to
transfer grew Peniccilin sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, as
did her sputum cultures here. She completed a 14 day course of
antitiobics on [**2134-6-27**]. She was afebrile and hemodynamically
stable prior to discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure:
Patient presented with BUN/Cr 115/6.8 in the setting of sepsis,
likely secondary to ATN, with evidence of muddy brown casts on
urine analysis. Renal ultrasound revealed no alternative cause
such as hydronephrosis. Her renal function gradually improved as
she became HD stable. Creatinine on discharge was 1.2.
.
# Thrombocytopenia
Patient had significant fall in platelet count during course of
hospitalization. Patter was concerning for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] heparin was
discontinued, argatroban was started. [**First Name3 (LF) **] antibody was
eventually negative so argatroaban discontinued and resumed
heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Thrombocytopenia ultimately felt to
be medication related. Famotidine was discontinued. Patient's
platelet count gradually normalized.
.
# Altered/Persistent Depressed mental status:
Patient had significant delay in recovery of mental status,
initially attributed to build up of benzodiazepines used for
sedation (on ventilator) in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **], evidenced by
prolonged presence of benzodiazepines in urine. Slowly improved
but some concern for waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] consciousness. MRI revealed
multiple acute subcortical infarctions in both cerebral
hemispheres. EEG was concerning for brief bursts of slowing seen
multifocally, but especially in the right frontal region
suggestive of possible seizure activity. Her EEG prior to
discharge demonstrated no seizure activity. Her clinical status
continued to improve. Outpatient neurology follow-up was
arranged.
.
# Critical Illness Myopathy/Polyneuropathy:
Patient with significant weakness and difficulty gaining motor
function in setting of sepsis and mechanical ventilation with
use of paralytics. Slowly improved throughout her course. Her
clinical status continued to improve. Outpatient neurology
follow-up was arranged.
.
# Fevers:
Patient intially febrile after completion of ATBx course,
however, repeat blood, urine cultures negative and CDiff toxin
negative and no leukocytosis. Gradually resolved and afebrile
for the 72 hours prior to discharge.
.
# Anemia:
HCT steadily trending down, could be from serial phlebotomies
vs. anemia of chronic disease. Stool guaiac negative.
B12/folate/iron studies unremarkable, hemolysis labs negative;
low ferritin and low retic index indicate hypoproliferative
anemia. Likely anemia of acute disease. Remained stable at 24.3
prior to discharge. She should have her hematocrit trended daily
initially. Our transfusion criteria had been hct < 21.

# Dental issues:
Patient noted to have poor dentition. Evaluation by general
dentistry revealed multiple broken molars which need extraction.
-> Panorex as outpatient given that patient is too weak to
stand/sit on stool independently. Will need outpatient f/u with
oral surgery as well.

# s/p Tachycardia
Patient's course was c/b developement of atrial flutter. She was
initially treated with nodal blocking [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with resulting
hypotension. She eventually responded well to amiodarone.
-> Will likely need taper off this medication given unclear need
and potential for more lung toxicity. Will need to discuss this
with her primaryoutpatient providers  upon leaving rehab.

# Transaminitis
LFTs elevated on presentation. Ultimately felt secondary to
hypotension, however in setting of persisten fevers there was
some concern for acalculous cholecystitis. RUQ ultrasound was
initially concerning for tense/enlarged gallbladder, but upon
further review by interventional radiology felt to be within
normal limits and not consistent with alcalculous cholecystitis.
LFTs were downtrending throughout the remainder of her hospital
course.
.
.
TRANSITION OF CARE
- Follow-Up Required--Patient will need repeat CT chest to
evaluate potentitial underlying pulmonary mass
--She will need follow up with Primary Care Physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] does
not have an established physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 112069**] will need to follow-up with a dental/oral surgery
--She will need neurology follow up
--Tracheostomy: will need removal of sutures around [**2134-7-10**];
keep tracheostomy neck ties in place at all times per
interventional pulmonary recommendations.
--Will be continued on amiodarone and Lasix upon discharge. Will
need outpatient labwork to evaluate renal function,
electrolytes, normalization of LFTs

antibiotics. Your course was complicated by kidney failure which
caused your body to become severely fluid overloaded, and by
severe muscle weakness caused by long ICU stay. You were too
weak to be directly extubated so instead you had a tracheostomy
(breathing tube placed in your neck). Your symptoms slowly and
steadily improved with treatment and you are now ready for
discharge to a rehab facility where you will have frequent
physical therapy to help you regain your strength.
.
Please attend the follow-up appointment listed below with
dentistry (for dental x-rays and to possibly have some broken
teeth pulled). Also please attend the neurology appointment
listed below, to follow up on your weakness and the changes on
your brain MRI.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STOPPED quinidine.
2. STARTED amiodarone 200mg by mouth daily for paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation
3. STARTED heparin 5000 units subcutaneous three times daily
(continue until your mobility improves, rehab doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
decide when you can stop)
4. STARTED colace and senna for constipation
5. STARTED maalox-diphenhydramine-lidocaine 15-30mL by mouth
every 4 hours as needed for mouth/throat pain
6. STARTED miconazole powder three applications per day for rash

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: CD2, CD3, CD4,
CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD34,
CD41, CD11c, CD56, CD64, HLA-DR, KAPPA, LAMBDA, CD71, GlycA,
CD45, CD117.
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize blast yield.
An abnormal population of events cluster within the blast gate.
They comprise of approximately 37% of all events. These 'blasts'
express CD7, CD34, CD13 (dim), CD33, CD11c(dim) and CD71. CD19
expression is equivocal. They are negative for CD20, CD10, CD3
(and other T-cell markers except CD7), CD64, CD14 and CD56.
Lymphoid gated events are unremarkable.
INTERPRETATION
Increased blasts with predominantly myeloid markers, consistent
with acute myeloid leukemia.  Morphological review shows blasts
(~58%) with high N:C ratio, rare Auer rods, scant paucigranular
cytoplasm, irregular nuclear contours, and open chromatin.
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2158-7-14**].
.
- [**7-14**] Bone Marrow:  By morphology and immunophenotype, the
blasts appear to be of early myeloid differentiation (FAB M1-2).
However, cytogenetics and other molecular findings are necessary
and should be correlated for an appropriate current WHO based
classification.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Peripheral Blood Smear:
The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes are
decreased in number and are normochromic and normocytic with
mild anisopoikilocytosis.  Occasional ovalocytes, dacrocytes and
polychromatophilic cells seen, 2 nucleated RBCs, 100 nucleated
cells seen.   The white blood cell count appears decreased.
There is a predominance of large, immature forms with high
nuclear cytoplasm ratio, scant agranular cytoplasm, prominent
nucleoli and fine chromatin consistent with blast forms.  Rare
Auer rod identified.  Platelet count appears decreased.  Large
forms are seen.  Giant forms are not present.  Differential
shows   6% neutrophils,  0% bands,  0% monocytes,  28%
lymphocytes,  2% eosinophils,  0% basophils, 63% blasts seen.
- Aspirate Smear:
The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation.  The M:E ratio
is 1.9:1.  Erythroid precursors show normoblastic maturation
with occasional megaloblastoid forms, irregular nuclear
contours, and rare nuclear buds.  Myeloid precursors consist of
a predominance of blast forms.  Megakaryocytes are present in
decreased numbers; abnormal forms are seen and include small
hypolobated forms.  Differential shows:  62% Blasts,  0%
Promyelocytes, <1% Myelocytes, 0% Metamyelocytes, 0%
Bands/Neutrophils, <1% Plasma cells,  3% Lymphocytes, 33%
Erythroid.
Blasts comprise 62% of the aspirate and are large with fine
chromatin, prominent nucleoli and scant cytoplasm.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:
The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.  Prominent
aspiration artifact is present.  The overall cellularity of ~
70% with 80% blasts.  The M:E ratio estimate is normal.
Erythroid precursors are decreased and exhibit normoblastic
maturation.  Myeloid elements are decreased and consist of
predominantly blasts, without maturing hematopoiesis.
Megakaryocytes are markedly decreased.
Marrow clot section is similar to the biopsy.
Special Stains:
Iron stain is adequate for evaluation.  Storage iron is normal.
Sideroblasts are present.  Ringed sideroblasts are absent.
.
- [**7-14**] Cytogenetics: KARYOTYPE: 46,XY[20]
INTERPRETATION:
No cytogenetic aberrations were identified in 20
metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated specimen.
This normal result does not exclude a neoplastic
proliferation.
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be
detectable using the standard methods employed.

FISH evaluation for a 5q deletion was performed with the
Vysis LSI EGR1/D5S23, D5S721 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**]
Molecular) for EGR1 at 5q31 and D5S721/D5S23 at 5p15.2 and
is interpreted as NORMAL. Two EGR1 hybridization signals
were observed in 100/100 nuclei examined, which is within
the normal range established for this probe in the
Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**]. Up to 3% of cells in
normal samples can show apparent 5q deletion using this
probe set. A normal EGR1 FISH finding can result from
absence of a 5q deletion, from a 5q deletion that does not
involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from
an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the
Vysis D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for
D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha
satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as
NORMAL. Two D7S522 hybridization signals were observed in
100/100 nuclei, which is within the normal range
established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory
at [**Hospital1 18**]. Up to 3% of cells in normal samples can show
apparent 7q deletion using this probe set. A normal
D7S522 FISH finding can result from the absence of a 7q
deletion, from a 7q deletion that does not involve the
region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an
insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the
Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is
interpreted as NORMAL. Two hybridization signals were
observed in 98/100 nuclei examined, which is within the
normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics
Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**]. Up to 8% of cells in normal samples
can show apparent 20q deletion using this probe set. A
normal 20q FISH finding can result from absence of a 20q
deletion, from a 20q deletion that does not involve the
region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an
insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

Bone marrow [**2158-7-27**]: Peripheral Blood Smear:
The smear is adequate. Erythrocytes are decreased and exhibit
moderate anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. Scattered microcytes,
echinocytes, elliptocytes, dacrocytes and red cell fragments are
seen. Rare shistocytes are seen on scanning. The white blood
cell count appears markedly decreased and includes large
immature myeloid forms consistent with blasts. Lymphocytes
include small mature and large reactive forms. Platelet count
appears moderately decreased. Large forms are seen. Differential
count shows 0% neutrophils, 0% bands, 4% monocytes, 89%
lymphocytes, 0% eosinophils, 7% blasts.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation
and is predominantly comprised of large atypical myeloid forms
with one to several prominent nucleoli consistent with blasts.
Erythroid precursors are markedly decreased. Rare maturing forms
are present. Maturing myeloid precursors are greatly decreased
in number. Megakaryocytes are present in normal numbers.
Differential (300 cells) shows:  72% Blasts, 2% Promyelocytes,
<1% Myelocytes, <1% Metamyelocytes, <1% Bands/Neutrophils, 3%
Plasma cells, 18% Lymphocytes, 5% Erythroid.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate
for evaluation. The overall cellularity is approximately 40% and
is comprised almost entirely of large blast forms present in
large clusters. The blasts comprise 70-80% of overall marrow
cellularity. The remainder of the cellular components are made
up of lymphocytes, plasma cells and rare maturing myeloid and
erythroid precursors. Megakaryocytes are present.

Imaging:
- [**7-14**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Biatrial dilation.
.
- [**7-14**] CXR:  No previous images. There is some apparent
hyperexpansion of the
lungs suggesting some chronic pulmonary disease. However, no
evidence of
acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
Right subclavian PICC line extends to the mid portion of the
SVC. No evidenceof pneumothorax.
.
- [**7-20**] CXR: Aside from atelectasis in the left base the lungs
are clear. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal
contours are normal. Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.
.

repeat examination in six months.Multifocal subsegmental
atelectasis, not obstructive. Coronary calcification.
.
- [**2158-7-28**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: No abnormal interstitial lung
process or site of infection identified. Interval increase in
number of mediastinal nodes extensively, but no single
pathologically enlarged lymph node.
.
- [**2158-7-30**] CTA chest: 1. Limited CT examination due to respiratory
artifact. No proximal or segmental pulmonary emboli identified.
More distal branches obscured due to poor filling and breathing
artifact. If a high clinical concern for embolus, a dedicated
V/Q scan could be obtained if patient is able to tolerate as the
lungs. Slightly increased linear atelectasis. 2. Unchanged small
mediastinal lymph nodes of uncertain etiology. 3.
Atherosclerotic calcification within the coronary vessels.
Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia. 4. Stable right-sided pulmonary
nodules as detailed above; can be followed in six months as
suggested on initial [**2158-7-24**] CT chest.
.
- [**2158-8-15**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Mild delayed right nephrogram with
high-density filling defect within the posterior calices of the
right upper pole, most consistent with underlying clot. There is
mild right hydronephrosis and proximal-mid hydroureter with
abrupt cutoff of contras column in the mid-distal ureter. This
may reflect more distal intraureteral clot, although a focal
obstructing lesion cannot be
completely excluded. Can consider correlation with follow up CT
or further
evaluation with dedicated MR urogram or ureteroscopy as needed.

Brief Hospital Course:
66yo M w/ unrelated PMH presented to OSH, found to have
pancytopenia w/ blasts in smear, transferred and found to have
AML on flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy.
.
# AML: Patient was admitted and found to be pancytopenic but
asymptomatic except a chronic non-productive cough that was
attributed to seasonal allergies. He underwent TTE which showed
normal LVEF. He underwent bone marrow biopsy on [**7-14**] which
confirmed diagnosis of AML. A triple lumen subclavian CVL was
placed on [**7-14**]. He was started on 7+3 induction therapy on [**7-14**].
He tolerated the infusion well and his ANC fell to 0 on [**7-22**]. He
was thrombocytopenic and developed gingival bleeding with PLT in
the 30s and was transfused as needed. He was also anemic and
transfused as needed. Repeat bone marrow showed
hypercellularity. Patient was started on MEC therapy and
tolerated it well. His ANC remained 0. Repeat bone marrow on D14
of MEC showed hypocellularity. His counts gradually increased
and antibiotics were discontinued, he had been on broad coverage
with vancomycin, cefepime, and ambisome (spent a lot of time in
[**State 15946**]) and remained on these antibiotics until he was no
longer neutropenic or febrile.  Counts continued to increase and
at the time of discharge pt was no longer neutropenic and WBC
was 4.1.  Bone marrow biopsy on [**2158-8-28**] showed no clonal
cytogenetic aberrations and <5% blasts.  However, skin biopsy
for a purple-pink papular rash on both forearms with biopsy was
consistent with leukemia cutis.  Considering his bone marrow
response and the resolution of this rash, it was thought to be
rseolved.  He will followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for futher
treatment.
.
# Febrile Neutropenia: As counts decreased, the patient was
febrile without obvious source in urine or lungs and was started
on cefepime and vancomycin and levofloxacin which had been
prescribed for cough was discontinued. Given the concern for
hemorrhoids and possible minor anal mucosal tear, see below,
Flagyl was added. Micafungin was added on day 4 after first
spike given continued fevers. Pt. felt well and was ambulatory,
taking PO during this time. Patient clinically improved, but
then developed high fevers, rigors, and whole-body rash,
respiratory distress (see ICU course below). He was pan-scanned
again, and CT sinus showed sinusitis. Coccidio, beta-glucan,
galactmannan, histoplasmosis, legionella, blood fungal cultures
were sent and were all eventually negative. ID was consulted and
suggested removing cefepime and micafungin as they might cause
rash. He was placed on vancomycin, meropenem, and ambisome (for
aspergillus and coccidiomycosis coverage). Patient had risen
LFTs which eventually trended down. He improved clinically and
antibiotic coverage was stopped on [**8-26**] when patient had been
afebrile for several days and ANC >1000.  Beta glucan from [**8-26**]
was >500.  ID was consulted again and advised to recheck beta
glucan, as it may have been an erroneous result, since he was
asymptomatic and had stable lesions on chest CT from [**8-26**], and
also requested a mycoF/lytic culture.  These results are to be
followed up as an outpatient and no antifungal coverage or
liver/spleen imaging were advised unlses the he spiked a fever,
which he did not do.
.
# Guaiac positive stool: Patient reported hard and painful BM
during induction therapy. Bloody streaks were seen on stool,
minimal blood in toilet. Platelets transfused, Hct stable. Bowel
regimen increased and further BMs were guaiac neg and soft for
the rest of his hospital course.

#hematuria: noted to have hematuria [**8-15**] in the setting of
thrombocytopenia.  CT abd/pelvis showed mild R hydronephrosis
and proximal-mid hydroureter on [**8-15**].  Hematuria resolved as
thrombocytopenia resolved, platelets were transfused for <10.
F/u ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis in the setting of
increasing creatinine, urology was consulted concerning the
hydronephrosis and advised that he follow up as an outpatient
for a hematuria workup.
.
#Thrombocytopenia: pt had low platelets as expected and was
transfused PRN for platelets <10.  On [**8-20**], had urticarial
reaction to crossmatched platelets that improved with tylenol,
PRA assay positive.  Thrombocytopenia improved without
intervention as the rest of counts went up as well.

#Acute kidney injury: Patient's creatinine was elevated starting
[**8-24**] from baseilne of 0.9 to 1.8 on [**8-29**] despite removal of
nephrotoxic vancomycin and ambisome on [**8-26**].  Renal was
consulted and considering FeNa of 2.1, was thought to be due to
AIN, although it is unclear which medication caused this.  He
did have a drug rash earlier in his hospital course, thought to
be related to micafungin or meropenem, but it is unclear what
caused the AIN.  He will followup with renal service as an
outpatient.

#L 4th and 5th finger numbness: Patient had noted this
consistently for a week and mentioned it on [**2158-8-24**].  MRI T and
C spine and brachail plexus were ordered to eval for CNS spread
of disease, in addition LP was done.  No lesions on MRI and no
evidence of CNS disease.  Numbness may be [**12-27**] ulnar neuropathy,
he will follow up in neurology clinic and may get an EMG.
.
ICU Course ([**Date range (1) 29638**])
Hypoxia: Pt with increased O2 demand and some respiratory
distress which lead to his brief transfer from the onc service
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Pt was initially given nebs, changed from NC to
facemask, and given IV lasix. He was redosed with lasix with
good urine output. CXR showed no change and ECHO was obtained.
Pt O2 requirement stabilized and he was titrated down to lower
dose nasal cannula.
.
Febrile Neutropenia: Temp of 101.4 at time of ICU transfer.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were continued but elevated LFTs
raised concern over the administration of fluconazole. Because
of the pts significant travel history to some fungal endemic
regions it was determined to treat emperically with Ambisome so
this was started and Fluconazole D/Ced. Near the end of the
first Ambisome infusion pt spiked a fever above 104 and had
chills/rigors. This calmed down with demerol and tylenol and was
thought likely due to the infusion vs an infectious cause.
.
Pancytopenia: This was thought [**12-27**] to AML and chemo with Hgb low
on ICU presentation. Over brief ICU course 1 unit of PRBC was
initially given followed by 2 units PRBC the next day. Pt had
mild temp at time of beginning of the 2nd transfusion but it was
administered in spite of this. Hct responded appropriately to
these infusions.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86903**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] because you had low blood count. We obtained a
bone marrow biopsy which showed that you had acute myelogenous
leukemia. You were started on chemotherapy. Your cell counts
dropped as expected, and you developed a fever. We did CT scans
of your sinus, chest, and abdomen to look for a source of
infeciton. We treated you with many antibiotics. One of the
antibiotics gave you a rash, which resolved after we stopped it.
You had a repeat bone marrow biopsy which still showed leukemia,
so you underwent a second round of chemotherapy. While you white
blood cell counts were at their nadir, you have difficulty
breathing and spiked high fevers with rigors for many days. We
continued with medications to treat bacterial or fungal
infections. You eventually got better and did not have any more
fevers and your white blood cell counts increased (including
neutrophil count) and we stopped your antibiotics.  We did a
final bone marrow biopsy which showed <5% blasts, indicating a
good response.  You will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Friday
to discuss the next steps in your treatment.

Your creatinine was increasing (number that shows kidney
function), which we think is likely due to acute interstitial
nephritis (allergic reaction in your kidneys likely from
medications).  You should follow up with urology clinic and
renal clinic about this and the blood in your urine you had a
couple of weeks ago.  You should also follow up in neurology
clinic so they can check on the numbness in your left hand.
Your sutures can be taken out in one week (around [**9-7**]), this
can be done at clinic.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
stop taking diovan
start taking nifedipine (procardia)
start taking acyclovir

History of Present Illness:
66 year-old right-handed man with PMH
significant for HTN, a.fib (on Coumadin), s/p
defibrillator/pacemaker (he says for bradycardia) CAD s/p 2
stents, prior stroke(initially with left sided weakness but he
reports no residual weakness) presented to [**Hospital6 50929**] this morning with right sided weakness. He says he woke
up at 4AM to go to the bathroom, but upon awakening, noticed
that
his right hand and arm was weak. He tried getting out of bed,
but
fell to the ground because of right sided weakness. He says he
stayed on the ground for a few minutes, but was able to get
himself up. He noticed that the right side of his face was
drooping and that his speech was slurred. He was initially
brought to OSH, where a NCHCT showed a left basal ganglia
hemorrhage. He was given 10 mg of Vitamin K for an INR of 2.6
(no
FFP was given) and Labetalol 20 mg IV for a SBP in the 170s. He
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
  He says that he believes his right arm is most affected
(weakest, no sensory changes reported), followed by his face and
then his leg. He says there has not been any progression of his
symptoms since onset this morning upon awakening. No other
symptoms aside from right sided weakness and slurred speech,
inlcuding no sensory changes, visual changes, headache, vertigo,
nausea/vomiting. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he received Profilinine, was
ordered for 2 units FFP (did not receive while in ED, but was
due
to receive in ICU) and started on a Nicardipine gtt.


Neuro ROS: Positive for right sided weakness and dysarthria as
per HPI. He does note neck pain beginning yetserday evening, but
no headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia,
dysphagia,
lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. No
difficulties producing or comprehending speech. No focal
numbness, parasthesiae. He does report episode of urinary

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2104-12-29**] 4:58 PM
Preliminary report
FINDINGS: A 17 x 14 mm intraparenchymal bleed in the left
lentiform nucleus is unchanged from the prior CT approximately
six hours prior. There is mild mass effect due to surrounding
edema with compression of the adjacent sulci, but no shift of
the normal midline structures or evidence of herniation. No new
foci of hemorrhage are present.
A hypodense region just anterior to the hemorrhage is likely an
old lacunar infarct. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size
and configuration. The basal cisterns are patent. The visualized
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities
are clear.

IMPRESSION: No change in the left lentiform nucleus
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. This is likely secondary to
hypertension. Further workup to exclude vascular or neoplastic
etiologies can be pursued based on clinical correlation.
.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2104-12-30**] 3:18 AM
FINDINGS: As seen on the previous CT, there is a 1.7 cm x 1.4 cm
x 2.4 cm
sized acute intracranial hematoma in the left basal ganglia with
surrounding
edema. There is no appreciable mass effect on the lateral
ventricle. There
is no midline shift. An old infarct is seen in the left anterior
basal
ganglia extending into the corona radiata with ex vacuo
dilatation of the left
lateral ventricle. Also seen are multiple chronic lacunar
infarcts in the
right caudate and lentiform nuclei. Visualized orbits, paranasal
sinuses, and
mastoid air cells are unremarkable. No fracture is seen.

CTA HEAD: Bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries,
vertebral
arteries, basilar artery and their major branches are patent
with no evidence
of stenosis, occlusion, or dissection. A small less than 2-mm
sized aneurysm
is seen arising from the left ICA bifurcation. The anterior
communicating
artery appears bulbous without any definite saccular aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged left basal ganglia hemorrhage.

2. Chronic infarct in the left anterior basal ganglia with ex
vacuo
dilatation of the left lateral ventricle as described above.

3. Less than 2-mm sized outpouching from the left ICA
bifurcation may
represent a tiny aneurysm. The anterior communicating artery
appears bulbous without any definite saccular aneurysm.
.
Cardiology:
ECG Study Date of [**2104-12-29**]  2:45:18 PM


Sinus bradycardia. A-V conduction delay. Prolonged Q-T interval.
Marked
anterior and anterolateral T wave inversion consistent with
metabolic
abnormality or myocardial ischemia. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 RHM with PMH significant for HTN, AF (on warfarin), s/p
defibrillator/pacemaker (for ? bradycardia) CAD s/p 2 stents,
prior stroke (initially with left sided weakness but no residual
deficit) presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] with right sided
weakness (arm>face>leg) and dysarthria. CT revealed a left basal
ganglia IPH and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-12-29**]. Given
the presence of the IPH, his warfarin was reversed and stopped.
Patient was initially admitted to the ICU given significant
hypertension requirinng an IV nicardipine infusion. He was
transferred to the floor on [**2104-12-30**]. CTA was stable and no
significant aneurysm was identified. Although the most likely
cause for his IPH is hypertension, it was not possible to do an
MRI to look for an underlying lesion given pacemaker. Aspirin
should be started in 1 week and he will not be continued on
warfarin. He was transferred to rehab on [**2104-12-31**] and has
neurology follow-up. He should have a repeat CT head with and
without contrast prior to his follow-up to assess for the
presence of an underlying mass lesion.
.
.
# Neuro: Patient had a previous stroke as above with no residual
deficits and presented with right face, arm and leg weakness in
the setting of some mild neck pain but no clear headache on
[**2104-12-29**]. At OSH he was found to have a left basal ganglia
hemorrhage. He was given 10 mg of Vitamin K for an INR of 2.6
(no FFP was given) and Labetalol 20 mg IV for a SBP in the 170s.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. At
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, he received Profilinine (activated factor IX) and
received 2 units FFP later for INR 2.3. Examination revealed
right hemiparesis and right facial droop with dysarthria but no
aphasia, neglect or visual field defect. He was started on a
Nicardipine infusion for SBP up to 200s and was admitted to the
neuro ICU.

His head CTs remained stable showing no extension of the bleed.
CTA showed an old infarct in the left anterior basal ganglia
extending into the corona radiata with ex vacuo dilatation of
the left lateral ventricle in addition to multiple chronic
lacunar infarcts in the right caudate and lentiform nuclei and
angiography demonstrated a less than 2-mm sized aneurysm arising
from the left ICA bifurcation.

Stroke risk factors were assessed with HbA1c 5.4% and FLP
revealed Cholesterol 240 TGCs 111 HDL 41 LDL 177. CEs were
negative. He was initially monitored with glucose fingersticks
and this was stopped after several normal readings. He was
therefore started on atorvastatin 40mg daily and his fasting
lipids should be repeated in 3 months.

He continued to receive daily vitamin K until [**2104-12-30**] and INR
on [**2104-12-31**] was 1.0. He passed bedside swallow evaluation and
was placed on a regular diet. He slowly improved and was
transferred to the neurology floor on [**2104-12-30**]. We held all
antiplatelets and aspirin 325mg should be started in 1 week. We
stopped warfarin due to his hemorrhage. We were unable to obtain
an MRI given the patient's pacemaker and he will therefore need
a repeat CT scan with contrast to evaluate any possible
malignancy underlying the hemorrhage before his neurology
appointment.

The most likely cause of his hemorrhage is a hypertensive bleed
although his hypertension was controlled previously. As above we
will evaluate with interval scan to look for an underlying
lesion which may have bled.

His weakness was slowly improving at the time of discharge. He
was stable and BP was controlled on his home medications. He was
assessed by PT and deemed to benefit from rehab. He was
therefore transferred to rehab on [**2104-12-31**].
.
# CVS: BP was initially uncontrolled and was markely
hypertensive requiring IV meds and ICU admission. This was
latterly controlled and BP on discharge was SBP 120s-130s. He
was briefly hypotensive in the setting IV nicardipine and home
anti-hypertensives and this resolved before transfer to the
flor. We continued patient's home lisinopril and carvedilol.  We
monitored his INR daily and was 1.0 on discharge. Warfarin was
stopped and he should be restarted on aspirin 325mg daily in 1
week. Patient was started on atorvastatin 40mg daily as above
and should have repeat FLP in 3 months.
.
# Renal: Patient was admitted with Cr 1.3. He was not known to
have CRF. His Cr rose to 1.6 post-CT contrast on [**2104-12-31**]. This
should be repeated in 2 days time and then at least weekly.
.
# Code: Full Code
.
.
TRANSITIONAL CARE  ISSUES:
Patient will need a repeat CT head scan with contrast as an
outpatient in [**4-24**] weeks from discharge. This has been requested.
Restart aspirin at 325mg daily in 1 week.
Please monitor Chem 7 as Cr rose from 1.3 to 1.6 following CT
contrast.
Repeat fasting lipids in 3 months.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at the
[**Known firstname 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. You presented with
right-sided weakness and facial droop. You had a CT scan and
were found to have a bleed in your brain in the area of the left
basal ganglia. As you were on warfarin (Coumadin) which is a
blood thinner and worsens bleeding, this was reversed with
medications and Coumadin was stopped. Your blood pressure was
initially high and you had to be treated with IV medications to
lower your blood pressure in the ICU. Your blood pressure
normalised and you were transferred to the neurology floor. You
did well and your strength on the right side was slowly
improving. Your warfarin was stopped and should not be continued
due to further risk of bleeding. You should stop aspirin
currently and restrat at 325mg daily in 1 week. We also started
atorvastatin for high cholesterol as your cholesterol was found
to be high. This should be repeated in 3 months time. Your
kidney function tests were also slightly abnormal following the
CT contrast and this will be followed at rehab. You were
continued on your other home medications. The most likely cause
of this brain hemorrhage was high blood pressure although given
your pacemaker we were unable to do an MRI. As a result you will
need to have a repeat CT scan in 6 weeks  as at this point the
blood should have reabsorbed and we will be able to look to see
if there is any lesion underlying your hemorrhage. You were
deemed appropriate for rehab and transferred to rehab on
[**2104-12-31**].

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
pneumonia, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7756**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with dementia and benign
meningioma, presenting from [**Hospital3 2558**] with increased
productive cough, SOB and tachycardia. Patient has had one week
of increasing productive cough. She denies any chest pain,
nausea, vomiting. She is unable to provide further history about
her symptoms.
.
Of note, she was admitted from [**Date range (1) 108390**] for sinus
tachycardia and chronic cough. She was again admitted from
[**Date range (1) 33900**] for a rash that was determined to be from
metronidazole, which she was taking for Clostridium difficile
colitis, upon which she was placed on PO vancomycin, which she
was to take until [**2185-5-7**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100 P 150 BP 140/84 R 20 Sat 98%
2L. Patient was noted to have wheezing on exam with crackles at
bases R>L. She was also noted to have diffuse rash on torso,
legs, and arms, documented to be from Flagyl at [**Hospital3 2558**].
CXR was concerning for RLL pneumonia, so she was given a dose of
Vancomycin and levofloxacin IV. She was also noted to have UTI.
She was given 1g of tylenol for fever. HRs improved briefly to
90s with brief conversion to NSR after IVF bolus, then converted
back to Afib with rates in 150s. She received a total of 1.5L of
IVFs in the ED. For ventricular rates intermittently in 150s,
she was then given 5mg IV lopressor which decreased HR to
110s-130s. Patient has a signed DNR form in her [**Hospital3 2558**]
records. She had also complained of some abdominal discomfort in
the ED, but on exam, she was easily distracted with no signs of
tenderness. Vitals in ED prior to transfer were as follows: HR
98 BP 115/61 RR 28 O2sat 99% 2L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient appears comfortable and states
that her cough is much better. She complains of no chest pain or
dyspnea. She has no noted pain.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No
recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 96.6 BP: 114/64 P: 69 R: 27 O2: 97%RA
General: Alert, oriented x 3, no acute distress, cooperative
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: rhonchorous sounds present at the right base > left base,
presence of upper airway sounds, no accessory muscle use, no
wheezes

edema
Skin: exfoliative, erythematous rash on arms, legs and torso


Pertinent Results:
CT Chest w/o Contrast: [**2185-5-31**]
1. Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, with associated
dependent
atelectasis, including left lower lobe collapse, with additional
atelectasis seen dependently in the right middle lobe. There is
associated opacification of the left lower lobe bronchi, which
may reflect mucus plugging or aspiration. In the aerated lung
parenchyma, there are no focal opacities to suggest pneumonia.
2. Redemonstration of left apical lung mass, suboptimally
evaluated due to
respiratory motion, though little change from [**2184-5-21**].
3. Aortic valvular calcifications, with mild ectasia of the
ascending aorta.
4. Atrophy of the left kidney, with configuration suggesting
chronic left UPJ obstruction.
5. Moderately severe biapical pleural scarring.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis: [**2185-5-30**]
1. Bibasilar and right middle lobe atelectasis with small
bilateral pleural
effusions, new since prior imaging.
2. Resolution of the previously described pancreatitis of the
tail with a
stable 16-mm hypodense lesion which may represent either a
pseudocyst or other pancreatic cystic lesion, for example IPMN.
This could be further evaluated with MRCP.
3. Unchanged multiple fat-containing anterior abdominal wall
hernias. One
midline hernia now contains a loop of transverse colon but no
evidence for
proximal obstruction.
4. No intra-abdominal collection to account for elevated white
cell count.
.
[**2185-5-30**] RUE U/S: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
.
Microbiology:
UCx [**2185-5-23**] with E.coli; all blood cultures negative; repeat

Brief Hospital Course:
HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA: Treated with vancomycin and
cefepime x 8 day total course.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RAPID VENTRICULAR RATE: Treated with
dilatiazem and metoprolol.  Discharge regimen was metoprolol
12.5mg po bid and diltiazem 60 mg po QID. Diltiazem may be
converted to Diltiazem XR 240 mg po q day as an outpatient.
Heart rates well-controlled when patient takes medications as
scheduled.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY FAILURE: Treated with IVF and improved
to 2.1-2.2 at time of discharge.

C DIFF COLITIS: Recent c diff 1 month ago.  The patient was
treated in the last month with flagyl and developed a rash, at
which time she was transitioned to PO vancomycin, which she
completed prior to this admission.  While on broad spectrum
antibiotics for HCAP above she developed a leukocytosis of 20
from 5 so she was started empirically on vancomycin oral 125mg
po q6hrs and should continue this for after she is finished with
her antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia (See below).

Aspiration: Patient noted to be frankly aspirating on [**2185-5-28**].
She was made NPO and was seen in evaluation by speech and
swallow. She had evidence of continued aspiration on three
subsequent evaluations, attributed to delirium and weakness from
prolonged hospitalization and multiple infections. In the
setting of her aspiration, elevated WBC, and findings on chest
CT she was started on an eight day course of
Piperacillin/Tazobactam for presumed aspiration pneumonia. In
discussion with her health care proxy it was decided that
parenteral nutrition or placement of a G-tube would not be in
keeping with her goals of care, and she was allowed to eat to
her comfort and desire. She was followed closely by both Speech
and Swallow and Nutrition.

Hypernatremia: While NPO for aspiration as above patient became
hypernatremic. She was treated for two days with D5W and her
sodium normalized.

History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with history of acute myelofibrosis with
panmyelosis (a rare form of acute leukemia), neutropenic, recent
admission for mild pancreatitis as well as neutropenic fever
after experimental chemotherapy cycle (C1D1 [**2198-4-5**], now C1D26),
now transfered from [**Hospital1 1474**] ED with tongue and anterior neck
swelling. Patient reports having aphthous ulcers in her mouth
for several days secondary to chemotherapy, and had begun using
glycerin (FIRST) mouthwash, after which she noted tongue and
anterior neck swelling this morning. She has used this product
in the past, but not for at least a year. She noticed soon after
using that the bottle was expired. Patient is also on lisinopril
for hypertension, which she has been on long-term. She was
started on allopurinol two weeks ago. Patient noted no chest or
abdominal pain, rashes or pruritus. She did note some dyspnea at
the time, but no specific sensation of throat closing. She did
notice some symptoms of drooling. She also had some nausea, but
did not vomit. She had not eaten anything that morning. This
type of reaction and symptomatology has never occurred before.
She presented initially to [**Hospital1 1474**] ED where she was given
benadryl, famotidine, IV methylprednisolone, and an epinephrine
pen injection, after which symptoms of dyspnea dramatically
improved, per patient report. She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management. Her tongue was still noted to be swollen
on arrival, though she has not had any throat tightness or
stridor symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
78F with history of acute myelofibrosis with panmyelosis (a rare
form of acute leukemia), neutropenic, recent admission for mild
pancreatitis as well as neutropenic fever after experimental
chemotherapy cycle(C1D8 of Protocol 08-269 A Phase I (RAD001
PKC412, day 1=[**2198-4-5**], last dose [**2198-4-12**]), now presenting with
tongue and anterior neck swelling likely [**1-24**] lisinopril allergy

#. Tongue/neck swelling/Allergy to ACEI: Most likely allergic
reaction to ACEI (was on lisinopril).  Less likely etiologies
would be her study drug for myelofibrosis.  Patient received IV
steroids, benadryl and famotidine with improvement in symptoms,
and was switched to a PO regimen of prednisone 60 mg for a total
of 3 days..  Did not have stridor nor require intubation.
Allergy was consulted and felt that swelling likely [**1-24**] ACEI so
lisinopril was dc'ed and she is not to take ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] in the
future.  It was also recommended that she receive her study drug
under observation such as in the infusion clnic to monitor for
possible reaction.  Tryptase was sent to evaluate for C1
esterase inhibitor deficiency and is still pending.

#. Hypertension: Given likely allergy to lisinopril, it was
stopped.  Home metoprolol was continued at 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and
amlodipine 5mg daily started to help better control BP, as she
had SBP 150-160s.

#. Myelofibrosis with panmyelosis: on C1D26 or experimental
chemotherapy regimen. Recommenedation that pt should receive
experimental medications while observed as above. Continued
prophylactic levofloxacin and valacyclovir as well as home dose
allopurinol. Transfused 1 unit platelets and 1 unit of PRBC
during admission

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**],
You were admitted to the intensive care unit with swelling of
your tongue and neck.  It is possible that this was from your
study medication or it may have been due to the blood pressure
medication Lisinopril that you had been taking.  You should no
longer take lisinopril just in case the swelling was from this
medication.  Your symptoms improved with medications and
steroids.

The following medications were changed this admission:
1. STOP LISINOPRIL - you should never take this medication
again.  You should not take medications in this class (ace
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers).
2. Please START Prednisone 60mg daily for 1 more day.
3. Please START amlodipine 5mg daily for your blood pressure.
4. Please START benadryl as needed if you develop throat
tightness, lip swelling.

Please keep your followup appointments with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and your
primary care physician.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU SUMMARY:
==============
Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] is an 80 y.o. F with COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, s/p PPM
for Mobitz II, AAA s/p repair, RAS s/p stent, MRSA bacteremia,
presenting with 4 days of increasing dyspnea that was preceded
with rhinorrhea and productive cough of green/yellow sputum. She
denied fevers/night sweats, but admits to chills 1-2x. Her
daughter who lives with her also had a cold several days prior
to the patient's onset of symptoms. She had increasing SOB and
saw her PCP the day PTA, who gave her Flovent and started her on
Levaquin for a UTI. A CXR was negative at PCP's office. The
morning of ICU admission, the patient was ""gasping for air"" and
brought to the ED by her daughter.

In the ED, VS notable for BP 177/96, RR 30 and O2 sat 89% RA.
Noted to have bilateral expiratory wheezing with increased
respiratory effort. Given SoluMedrol 125 mg IV, Combivent nebs,
and covered for COPD flare with vancomycin 1 gm IV, CTX 1 gm IV,
and Azithromycin 500 mg po. Of note, BNP >70,000 (baseline
30,000). CXR showed no infiltrate, no pulmonary edema. D-dimer
was positive, CTA did not show PE or dissection, but showed
peribronchial opacities, concerning for early multifocal PNA.

In the MICU, she was continued on broad spectrum
antibiotics(Vancomycin/Zosyn/Azithromycin). She also received
Lasix on admission. She was switched to po prednisone for COPD
exacerbation. EP was consulted for changing EKG with new TWI in
II, III, AVF, which was thought to be T wave memory from pacer
placement. EP recommended keeping her I=O and correctly lytes,
no plan for DCCV until pt medically stable. She was transferred
to the medicine floor for further management.

MEDICINE FLOOR COURSE:
=======================
# ? Multifocal Pneumonia:  Concerning for pneumonia on CT.
Urine legionella was negative.  She never produced a sputum
culture.  She remained afebrile without leukocytosis. On
transfer from MICU, her broad spectrum antibiotics were changed
to azithromycin and ceftriaxone and then she was switched to
Levofloxacin for CAP and completed her course while in the
hospital.  Blood cultures remained negative.

# COPD: She continued to have wheezing throughout lung fields
and was intermittently tachypneic.  She was switched to po
prednisone and a taper was started and will be completed after
discharge.  Atrovent and albuterol nebs were given standing.
She was also continued on azithromycin.  Her supplemental oxygen
was weaned.  PT evaluated the patient, and with ambulation, her
O2 sats remained in the mid 90's.

# Supratherapeutic INR: Likely secondary to antibiotics. Her
Coumadin was held.  She will follow up with her PCP and have an
INR check.

# Diastolic CHF: Exam with bibasilar crackles c/w some mild
pulmonary edema in setting of known diastolic dysfunction. Her
home dose of Lasix was continued.

# Hypertension: Her home regimen was continued with good control
of her BPs.

# AFib: Rate well controlled with metoprolol. Scheduled for
outpatient elective cardioversion, but was cancelled due to her
hospitalization.  Coumadin was held while INR was
supratherapeutic.

# New TWI: Noted on EKGs. As discussed above, EP believed the
TWI were due to pacer maker and did not recommend any
intervention during this hospitalization.

# UTI: Urine grew out Klebsiella susceptible to ceftriaxone.
She completed her 3 day course of ceftriaxone while in the
hospital.

# h/o MRSA bacteremia: She was on vancomycin upon transfer to
the Medicine floor.  After vancomycin was stopped, she was
restarted on her doxycycline suppressive therapy.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Statin.

# Code: Full Code, confirmed with patient
.
# Contact: Daughter - [**Name (NI) 2048**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 26798**]

# Dispo: Home with services and close follow up with PCP.

History of Present Illness:
44 year old male with history of multiple sclerosis, baseline
cognitive defects, chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter and
recurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with
UTI. He was recently hospitalized [**Date range (3) 45860**] for UTI
complicated by encephalopathy (somnolent, difficult to arouse).
Urine culture grew staph aureus; sensitivities were not back by
time of discharge. He improved on bactrim and discharged on 14
day course. However, sensitivities after discharge returned with
MRSA.
.
He was seen by his outpatient urologist (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 770**])....

.
In the ED, initial VS: 95.1 75 151/100 16 97%. He received 1g IV
vancomycin. Previously, he had had an erythematous skin reaction
on the arm that vancomycin had been infusing. No history of resp
distress on vancomycin. Per ED, he had no ostensible reaction
while receiving the vancomycin. Per wife, he appeared more red
than usual in face and upper chest. Urology was called (but did
not officially consult) and agreed with admission to medicine
with urology following.
.
Within minutes of arrival to the floor, patient began to have
active seizures. Per wife, he does not have history of seizures
and was conversing and at baseline mental status while in ED. He
began to groan, head moving side to side, upper extremities
twitching and outstretched. During the first episode, he had
oxygen desaturation briefly to the mid 70s on room air for a few
seconds. Blood pressure was in systolic 180s; HR in 110s. He
then fell into stupor and within a few minutes again became
tremulous in upper extremities. Pupils were not reactive to
light. He received a total of 10mg iv ativan. Neurology was
consulted who recommended 1g loading dose of iv fosphenytoin.
Wife confirmed that pt is [**Name (NI) 835**]/DNR.

Studies
EEG [**3-18**]: CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: Began at 12:05 on [**3-18**]
and continued until 7:O0 the next morning. At the beginning, it
showed a low voltage faster pattern in all areas with bursts of
focal slowing especially in the left temporal region. There were
also some runs of rhythmic 6 Hz slowing in the left temporal
area and other runs of periodic slowing with sharp features,
none lasting for more than 8-10 seconds or so. On video, they
did not appear to have any clinical correlate. By the
evening, the background was more suppressed and, while left
temporal
slowing was still evident, the sharp features were not. SPIKE
DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed a few of the left temporal sharp
features, especially early in the record. SEIZURE DETECTION
PROGRAMS: Showed no electrographic seizures. PUSHBUTTON
ACTIVATIONS: There were none. SLEEP: No normal waking or sleep
patterns were evident. CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally
regular rhythm. IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no
pushbutton activations. There was continued focal slowing in the
left temporal region. Early in the record, this also included
some runs of irregular sharp activity and some 6 Hz rhythmic
slowing in the same area, but these episodes did not appear to
show any clinical evidence of seizure on video. They were brief.
No more prolonged and clear electrographic seizures were
recorded.

CXR [**2118-3-18**]: Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates low lung
volumes and worsening basilar atelectasis. The left PICC has
been removed. There is no focal consolidation, large pleural
effusion, or pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured.

MR head [**2118-3-19**]: FINDINGS: The study is compared with most
recent enhanced MR examination of [**2-/2118**], as well as the remote
study of [**2109-9-11**].
Again demonstrated is the extensive confluent
T2-/FLAIR-hyperintensity
throughout bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white
matter, with similar abnormality involving the posterior fossa,
including the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar
hemispheres. Allowing for the motion artifact, above, the
overall appearance is unchanged. By and in-large, the extensive
lesions demonstrate intrinsic T1-hypointensity, representing
""black holes"" of irreversible demyelination. However, there is a
prominent curvilinear or ""targetoid"" 16 mm focus of enhancement
in the right corona radiata with a possible second enhancing
focus in the corresponding location on the left. The right-sided
focus appears new since the [**4-/2117**] examination, though
previously, there was a smaller, more nodular focus in the
immediately adjacent centrum semiovale. Allowing for the marked
limitation in the post-contrast imaging, no other definite
enhancing focus is seen, with apparent interval resolution of
the left-sided subcortical white matter, temporal lobar and
cerebellar hemispheric foci. Currently, there is no pathologic
leptomeningeal or dural focus of enhancement.  There is no
definite focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic
event, and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids,
including those of the dural venous sinuses are preserved and
these structures enhance normally.  In comparison to the more
remote study there is no definite progression of the marked
global atrophy (particularly given the patient's age) or the
severe diffuse atrophy of the corpus callosum. Limited imaging
of the upper cervical spinal cord, through the mid-C4 level,
demonstrates no definite abnormality.
IMPRESSION: The study, particularly the post-contrast MP-RAGE
acquisition, is quite limited by motion artifact, with:
1. No significant change in the overall extensive demyelinating
""disease
burden."" 2. Curvilinear rim-enhancing focus in the right corona
radiata appears new since the [**2117-4-6**] study and likely
represents a site of active inflammation; allowing for the
limitation above, there is no definite additional enhancing
focus, with apparent interval resolution of many of the foci
demonstrated on that study. 3. Marked global and corpus callosal
atrophy, not significantly changed since the [**9-/2109**] study.

CXR [**2118-3-25**]: : A right-sided PICC terminates within the distal
SVC. The aeration of the lungs has improved compared to the
prior study. Cardiac silhouette is stable. No large pleural
effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax. Bones are intact.
IMPRESSION: Right-sided PICC terminating within the distal SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45855**] is a 44yoM with h/o multiple sclerosis, baseline
cognitive defects, chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter and
recurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with a
UTI and new onset seizures.
.
After initially being admitted to the floor, he developed
seizures requiring 10mg IV ativan and started on fosphenytoin
with a load and transferred to the MICU.  He was noted to be
increasingly somnelent with periods of central apenea.  ABG
showed acidemia with CO2 on the 70s.  He was started on Bipap
with improvement in his CO2.  It was presumed that his central
apnea was secondary to his large ativan dose which slowly
improved with clearance of the ativan.  He was started
emperically on vanc/ctx/amp/acyclivir to cover both his UTI and
for empiric coverage for meningitis given his AMS. A head MRI
was done, which showed unchanged appearance of extensive
demyelinated, w/ new curvilinear rim focus in corona radiatia,
likely site of active inflammation, no evidence of ischemic
event, unchanged marked global atrophy. Given that meningitis
was less likely he was narrowed to vanc/[**Known lastname **].  He began to
wake up over the day on [**3-19**] and was weaned off BiPap to a
shovel mask and transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor, he remained stable throughout the day on [**3-20**].
However, that morning was noted to be more tachycardic and
febrile to 103 in the setting of hypoxia to the 80s.  He was put
on a NRB and sats remained in the 80s for a while before
improving to the mid- 90s.  ABG on NRB was 7.48/40/72.  His eyes
were open but wasn't following commands and appeared obtunded on
the floor. CXR on the floor showed no new infiltrate.  Patient
was transitioned to the MICU and briefly broadened to
vanco/[**Month/Year (2) **]/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, but quickly
narrowed given rapid improvement of respiratory status.  By
morning patient was alert and oriented X3, communicating and
breathing comfortably on 2L nasal cannula with saturation in mid
to high 90s.  Abx were again narrowed to [**Month/Year (2) 21347**]/Vanco for
coverage of UTI. Patient was then called out to floor.
.
#) Seizures (new): several possible etiologies in this patient;
he has severe multiple sclerosis, and though he has never had a
seizure before, there is a new area of inflammation on his MRI.
Infectious causes in setting of severe MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 45861**]
seizures, most notably his UTI. He was started on fosphenytoin
IV initially, then transitioned to phenytoin PO once mental
status improved. There was no sign of further seizure activity.
He will f/u w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in ~2 weeks
.
# Altered mental status: per wife, was at baseline until the
seizures. 24h EEG did not show status epilepticus. Mental status
then to near baseline by discharge suggesting largely resultant
from infections/medications/post-ictal state.
.
#) Apnea/Hypercarbia: fully resolved as his mental status
improved once coming out of the MICU the 2nd time.
.
#) UTI: growing MRSA and pseudomonas. He will is on
vancomycin/ceftazidime, and will complete a 14 day course. A
PICC line was insserted and home infusion company will assist w/
antibiotics. There was a question of home aids flushing his
foley, thus potentially introducing pathogens. There should be
no flushing of the foley and this was addressed w/ wife and in
page 1 instructions.
.
#) Rash w/ vancomycin: pt did develop red rash on arms and face
w/ vancomycin infusion. Component of redman syndrome was
suspected. Benedaryl was given w/ vancomycin and this improved
his symptoms. There was no other evidence of allergic disease,
and no facial swelling or airway obstruction.
.
#) Thrombocytopenia- Bseline ~150's, went downt to 89 this
admission. No signs of active bleeding. No rashes on exam. He
had been exposed to heparin in the last 30 days, so PF4 antibody
was checked and was negative. His platelets responded to
baseline by discharge, and likely this was all secondary to
acute infection.
.
#) Multiple sclerosis: initially held home home baclofen given
AMS, but restarted by discharge once mental status improved.
.
#) HTN: continued home amlodipine
.
# CODE: DNI/DNR (confirmed with wife)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr [**Known lastname 45855**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted
for a urinary tract infection. You then developed seizures. You
had a head MRI, which showed a new area of multiple sclerosis,
and this plus the infection is probably why you had a seizure.
You were started on antibiotics and anti-seizure medications,
and got much better.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
** START phenytoin (dilantin) [anti-seizure medication]. Take
150mg in the morning and at noon, and 200mg at night (3 total
doses per day)
** START vancomycin [antibiotic]
** START ceftazidine [antibiotic]
** START benadryl, take 20 minutes before vancomycin infusion

History of Present Illness:
61M with history of ESRD s/p CRT [**2101**], hypertension, diabetes,
diastolic CHF, admitted on [**2107-11-12**] with acute on chronic
dyspnea, now s/p PEA arrest. He presented on [**11-12**] with 2 days of
worsening dyspnea, cough, and fever/chills.  Also with
orthopnea, PND, and worsening edema in all 4 extremities.
.
Labs showed ARF with creatinine of 5.8 (up from 2.9).  During
hospital course on the floor, renal function continued to worsen
and urine output was low even with furosemide (unclear etiology
of ARF).  Also noted to have intermittent somnolence but
arousable and fully oriented.  ABGs repeatedly with partially
compensated respiratory acidosis (has also had this in the
recent past), team unsure how reliable ABGs were given bilateral
UE fistulas.
.
Patient was in angio having hemodialysis line placed when his
arrest event occurred.  He was placed in a lateral decubitus
position due to difficulty lying flat due to shortness of
breath.  Towards the end of his line placement, he became more
agitated and was pushing his facemask away.  O2 sats were unable
to be obtained.  He was then placed in supine position for line
suturing.  He was then noted to be nonresponsive, code blue
call.  Then noted to be pulseless.  CPR initiated and initial
rhythm asystole/very slow PEA, subsequently faster PEA.  Total
pulseless time 13 minutes.  Received total 2 mg epinephrine, 2
amps bicarb, 1 mg atropine, insulin/D50, IVFs via new HD line.

.
CXR [**2107-11-14**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-12**], there are
lower lung volumes. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
persists with mild vascular congestion suggested.
.
EKG: NSR at 94, NANI, low limb lead voltage, poor RWP (old); no
significant change from prior.
.
TTE [**2107-11-14**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very
small circumferenital pericardial effusion.
.
Renal ultrasound [**11-13**]:  No new findings.
.
CT Chest [**11-15**]:  On CT, there is no evidence of air embolism.
Cardiomegaly, mild axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral pleural effusions with areas of subsequent
atelectasis, patchy lower lobe predominant parenchymal opacity
is potentially suggestive of a combination of pneumonia and
atelectasis. No pathologic air collection in the mediastinum and
the lung interstitium.
.
CT Head [**11-15**]:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute
vascular territorial infarction. There is no hydrocephalus.
2. Opacification of sphenoid sinus, maxillary, ethmoid air cells
and
nasopharynx, most likely related to recent intubation.
.
CT Head [**11-17**]:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or obvious
major territorial acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
If there is continued concern, MR of the head with
diffusion-weighted imaging sequence is more sensitive in the
detection of acute stroke.
2. Diffuse opacification of the sphenoid sinus, nasopharynx, the
maxillary
and the ethmoid air cells partly related to mucosal thickening,
secretions
from intubation. However, patient also had a left antrochoanal
polyp in the past, which is incompletely assessed on the present
study.
3. Discontinuous foci in the left parietal bone may relate to
thinning of the bone, from arachnoid granulations or other
etiology, to correlate with any history of surgery. However,
this appearance is unchanged compared to the prior CT sinus
study done on [**2102-10-19**].
.
RUE US [**11-20**]:  Although subclavian vein not evaluated, remainder
of right upper extremity venous system appears normal with no
evidence of DVT, and DVT would be likely in the subclavian vein
given respiratory variation and normal appearance of remainder
of the study.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-21**]:  1. Severely limited examination demonstrates
changes of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease
with old left frontal encephalomalacia without evidence for
acute infarct.
2. Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
.
KUB [**11-25**]:  1. Severely limited examination demonstrates changes
of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old
left frontal encephalomalacia without evidence for acute
infarct.
2. Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
.
KUB [**11-26**]:   There is no evidence of free air. NG tube tip is in
the stomach. Right femoral catheter remains in place. There is
no evidence of bowel obstruction. There is nonspecific bowel gas
pattern.
.
Portable Abdomen XR [**11-29**]:  There is no evidence of ileus, small
or large bowel obstruction.
.
Abdominal US [**12-6**]:  Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound with
no findings to suggest the cause of the patient's pain.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-6**]:  1. Small thrombus within the IVC and at the
junction of the right common iliac vein and transplanted renal
vein.
2. Diffuse mesenteric stranding with no small or large bowel
pathology
identified.
.
CT Head [**12-11**]:  1. . No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Partial opacification of mastoid air cells bilaterally,
maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, partly polypoidal.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-11**]:  1. Very large spontaneous hematoma
involving a majority of the left hepatic lobe. A small amount of
perihepatic hematoma and scattered areas of blood within the
mesentery and along the left pericolic gutters tracking into the
pelvis. No definite site of active extravasation identified.
2. Branches of left portal vein are attenuated and not well
visualized in
the midst of the hematoma but are patent.
3. No change in small 1.5 cm thrombus within the infrarenal IVC.
Second
separate smaller thrombus in the right common iliac vein near
the transplant renal vein anastomosis on the prior study not
definitely visualized and may have cleared with anticoagulation.

4. Atelectasis of both dependent lower lobes.
5. More confluent consolidative opacity of the superior right
lower lobe
could be explained with atelectasis but is concerning for
possible area of
aspiration or pneumonia.
.
CT Abdomen [**12-16**]:  Limited study but no gross evidence of
obstruction.
.
CXR [**12-19**]:  There is interval development of vascular
engorgement, perihilar opacities, and bibasilar opacities, left
more than right, findings which might be consistent with
interval progression of pulmonary edema. Evaluation after
diuresis is recommended to exclude the possibility of underlying
infectious process.

61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF.
During IR placement of an HD catheter he suffered a PEA arrest x
2. He was cooled using artic sun protocol. He slowly recovered,
but his hospitalization was complicated by prolonged intubation
leading to tacheostomy placement, Psuedomonas UTI, HAP,
Stenotrophomonas PNA, aspiration PNA, acute on chronic kidney
injury leading to loss of fuction of his transplanted kidney,
IVC thombosis, spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrage during
heparinization for his thrombus, gout flair, and altered mental
status which has slowly improved. After more than a month in the
hospital he has stabilized, is ambulating with assistance,
speaking through a Passe Muir valve, and tolerating tube feeds.
.
# Aspiration:  Patient had emesis [**2107-12-13**] and aspirated tube
feeds. Developed aspiration pneumonitis vs. aspiration PNA. CXR
showed no clear evidence of PNA but CT showed confluent
consolidative opacity of superior RLL. Pt was febrile following
aspiration event and ended up re-intubated. Now s/p 7-day course
of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that ended on [**2107-12-18**]. Respiratory
status has dramatically improved and he is now on trach mask
only. He had a video swallow evaluation on [**2107-12-20**] which showed
silent aspiration.  It was suggested that he have a diet of
nectar thick liquids and soft consistency solids.  meds must be
crushed in purees with Q6 hour oral care.  He should have follow
up with speech therapy at rehab with repeat video swallow if
diet is to be advanced.
.
# Stenotrophomonas PNA: Diagnosed from repeated sputum cultures.
On Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]. Note that
Bactrim must be give FOLLOWING HD as it is dialyzed off.
Intially diagnosed [**12-2**], but was inadquately treated as Bactrim
was given prior to HD rather than after.
.
# Pseudomonas UTI: Had a long course of Cefepime for UCx
positive for Pseudomonas x 2.
.
# Line infection: S/p Cefepime initially for UTI. Then Linezolid
was added for purulent appearing CVL. His lines were exchanged
and complicated by PEA arrest during procedure. His CVL grew out
Micrococcus. According to ID, the Cefepime should have covered
it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
Linezolid. A PICC line and new HD line were placed and have had
no further complications.
.
# Labile blood pressures: Pt had been intermittently hypotensive
(infectious source vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency). His
infections were treated. He was given stress dose steroids. He
was on pressors for hypotension. Ultimately this resolved and he
became persistently hypertensive to the 190s to 220s. He was
started on a labetalol drip as well as PRN hydralazine. He has
been transitioned from Labetalol drip to PO Labetalol on [**12-9**],
then switched to Labetalol PRN. On [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c??????ed.
Continue atenolol at 50mg daily. Continue lisinopril 10mg daily.

.
# Foot Pain:  Likely gout, particularly given resolving hematoma
and renal failure. Receiveing pulse steroids with Prednisone
40mg daily x5 days starting on [**2107-12-20**]. Will resume chronic
Prednisone 5mg PO daily for maintenance of transplanted kidney
thereafter. [**Month (only) 116**] need suppressive allopurinol in the future for
his gout.
.
# DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver
hematoma developed (see helow). Hematology was consulted
regarding whether it is appropriate to resume anticoagulation
given the risk of bleed, and recommended SC Heparin tid until he
follows up with Hematology and possibly vascular surgery
regarding possible benefits vs. risks of an IVC filter
placement. The patient should not be anti-coagulated with agents
other than SC Heparin given his high risk of bleed.
.
# Abdominal Distension:  Patient??????s abdomen became distended and
tympanitic during this hospitalization. CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed
large liver hematoma with scattered areas of perihepatic
hematoma and scattered blood within the mesentery but without
definite sites of active extravasation.  Distension likely [**2-7**]
chemical peritonitis which is resolving following reversal of
anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]??????s syndrome from
infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient??????s
continued +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not
show dilated R side of colon and loops of bowel were read as
WNL.  Currently improved abdominal pain and minimally improved
distension. Abd is much less tense than prior.  Continue Reglan
2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
gastroparesis. Advancing diet as tolerated with tube feeds.
.
# Liver Hematoma:  As above, CT showed hematoma of liver while
on heparin drip for IVC thombus.  IR consulted re: possible
embolization, did not feel the bleed was acute (felt >48 hours
old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery and liver function if
possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General surgery
consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the
hematoma.  Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing
as needed and keeping Hct >20.  Received total of 3 unit pRBC
after reversal of PTT with FFP. Awaiting hematology
recommendation for long term anticoagulation given presence of
IVC thombus but complication of hemorrhage. (Ultimately decided
to hold all anticoagulation given severity of liver bleed.)
.
# Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest
with hypoxia beforehand. Was very difficult to wean from vent
due to persistent hypoxia, recurrent PNA, and altered mental
status. Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**]. Now stable on trach. Had
aspiration even as above leading to short tern re-intubation.
Now tolerating trach mask. Speaking with Passe Muir valve.
.
# Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest: S/p PEA arrest x 2.
Underwent Artic Sun cooling protocol. Suring weaning of sedation
was severely agitated. Ultimately was transitioned from fentanyl
to methadone and then weaned on seroquel. He had a significant
set back from his liver hematoma and aspiration PNA. Neuro was
consulted and noted a staring spell that was concerning for
seizures. He was monitored with continuous EEG, which showed
epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. Neuro
recommended startingKeppra, with Keppra 500mg qday and an extra
250mg after HD. The patient has slowly improved and is not
conversant, [**Location (un) 1131**], walking with assistance, and no longer
agitated. He is alert and oriented.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure. He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].
Etiology of ARF likely multifactorial due to hypotension from
PEA, sepsis, contrast loads, and nephrotoxic drugs. Her the
Renal Service, he will not recover renal function of his kidney.
He will require HD henceforth. Continue prednisone 5mg PO daily
for rejection as well as Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
.
# FEN:  Speech and Swallow Recs - video swallow: silent
aspiration seen on s/s for thin liquids. Recs: 1. Suggest a PO
diet of nectar thick liquids and soft consistency solids. 2. PMV
on for all POs. 3. Meds crushed with purees. 4. Monitor for
nutritional intake. 5. Q6 oral care. 6. Follow up speech therapy
in rehab s/p d/c

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted initially for volume overload and shortness of
breath. You had a long and complicated hospitalization for
treatment of this and various complications. You suffered a
severe type of heart attack called a PEA arrest. You required
life support from this event and were dependent on a breathing
machine for several weeks. Due to this a tracheostomy (breathing
tube in your neck) and feeding tube were placed. You had several
infections including a urinary tract infection, blood infection,
and pneumonias. You developed a clot in your veins and was
placed on blood thinners. Unfortunately, you bled while on the
blood thinners and these were stopped. Your kidney function
worsened and your transplanted kidney stopped functioning. You
were restarted on dialysis.

Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92191**] is a 39 year-old female with a history of NHL T-cell
status post mini-allo-MUD BMT in [**12/2114**] complicated by grade 1
skin GVHD now in remission, off CSA since [**6-/2115**], Prednisone
[**2-/2116**], and Cellcept [**4-/2116**], who presents from the ED with
hypotension, and fever.
*
She was recently evaluated in the Hem/[**Hospital **] clinic and a restaging
PET scan was worrisome for two new bilateral foci of increased
FDG uptake in the neck raising suspicion for recurrent FDG-avid
lymphoma. She was therefore scheduled for a CT neck with
contrast today for further evaluation. She pressented for her CT
scan to [**Hospital1 18**], and underwent the study uneventfully. Following
the procedure, she ate a hamburger with mayonnaise from the
cafeteria, and walked home. When she arrived, she developed
vague diffuse abdominal pain, then watery diarrhea X 3-4 times.
She also endorses N/V, with emesis X multiple times. Around the
same time, she also noted a new pruritic rash inside both her
ankles, which susbsequently resolved. She called EMS, who came
to her house, but for an unclear reason felt that she did not
require further care. She subsequently presented to the ED for
further evaluation. + chills and subjective fever, + flushing.
Mild dry cough over past few days. She reports a [**12-20**]-week
history of urinary frequency, no dysuria. ? Cloudy urine in past
week, with right-sided back pain. Urine culture from [**7-22**]
(hem/onc clinic) contaminated. No recent travel, no other
unusual food. She lives in a boarding home, may have been in
contact with other sick people.
*
In the ED, her initial vitals were T 104.2, HR 147, BP 91/39, RR
18, Sat 98% RA. She was hydrated with 6.5 L NS, and given
Vancomycin 1gm, Levofloxacin 500 mg IV, and Cefepime 2gm IV. She
was also given HC 100 mg IV, and Benadryl 25 mg IV. Her blood
pressure improved with the above therapy. A right IJ triple
lumen was placed in sterile conditions. She is being admitted
for further care.

RELEVANT IMAGING DATA:
[**2116-7-24**] CXR portable: Again noted are staples from prior lung
wedge resection on the right. There are very low lung volumes.
No definite
consolidations are seen. There is platelike atelectasis at the
left lung base. The heart size is normal given technique. No
layering pleural effusions are seen.
*
[**2116-7-24**] CT NECK W/ contrast: No abnormally enlarged nodes in
the neck. The areas of increased uptake noted on PET scan could
correspond to the region of the tonsils, which appear
unremarkable on the CT scan. However, any interval change in
their size could not be assessed due to lack of prior comparable
studies.
*
[**2116-7-17**] PET SCAN: Two new bilateral foci of increased FDG
uptake in neck raising raising suspicion for recurrent FDG-avid
lymphoma. Other considerations would include granulomatous
processes and reactive lymphadenopathy. The intensity is greater
than usually seen but does not exclude reactive nodes. Recommend
correlation with history of any recent infectious symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 39 yo female with history of T-cell NHL in
remission with recent abnormal PET scan findings under further
investigation, with fever, hypotension of 12-hour duration,
responsive to IVF.
*
1) Fever, hypotension: Resolved after one night. Although her
presentation most suggestive of severe sepsis, with elevated
lactate and hypotension responsive to IVF resuscitation, the
rapid resolution was more consistent with an anaphylactic
reaction to IV contrast from the CT.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] has reported a
similar admission where the patient presented with a septic
picture which subsequently resolved without localizing a source.
Sbe was treated with the sepsis protocol and broad-spectrum
antibiotic coverage with cefepime and levofloxacin.
Hydrocortisone was given in the emergency room, so [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim
test would have been useless.
*
2) T-cell NHL in remission: Recent PET findings were concerning
for disease recurrence, although CT neck without
lymphadenopathy. Her Acyclovir and Bactrim prophylaxis were both
continued. There were no active heme/onc issues during this
admission.
*
3) ARF: Creatinine up to 1.4 on admission, decreased to normal,
suspect pre-renal physiology given elevated specific gravity and
improvement with hydration.

Chief Complaint:
Transfer to CCU for hypotension status post elective peripheral
angiography

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right lower extremity angiography
Percutaneous coronary angioplasty of right anterior tibial
artery

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] is a 76 year-old female with a complicated PMHx
that includes CAD s/p Lcx stenting, DM type 2, s/p dual
pacemaker placement for bradycardia, atrial fibrillation on
chronic Coumadin therapy, with severe PVD s/p multiple stents,
angioplasties and atherectomies, with claudication symptoms. She
recently developed a RLE ulcer, and was referred for RLE
angiography and PTCA of her right tibial anterior tibial artery.


One hour after the procedure, Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] became hypotensive
with SBP down to 30s when the sheath was pulled, HR paced at 60.
She also complained of severe right groin pain at the cath site.
She was given Atropine X 2, IVF bolus, and transfused 2 units of
PRBCs. Her HR subsequently increased to 120s, then she went into

[**2124-1-24**] RLE angiography: Initial angiography showed a severely
diseased AT. We planned to treat this vessel with PTA and
atherectomy. Heparin was given for anticoagulation. Access was
obtained in an antegrade fashion of the RCFA and a 7 French
Arrow sheath was advanced to the mid SFA. The AT was crossed
with great difficulties with numerous wires, including PT
[**Name (NI) 9165**], [**Name (NI) 9166**] and Shinobi. However, attempts to cross the
distal lesion with atherectomy or angioplasty devices failed.
Finally, a 2.0x20 mm Maverick crossed the lesion, which was
dilated at 12 Atm. Next, a 2.5x20 mm Quantum Maverick balloon
was used to dilate the entire AT at 12-22 Atm. Final angiography
showed no residual stenosis with flow to the foot through the PA
and AT. The patient left the lab in stable
condition.

[**2125-1-24**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Changes of
emphysema are seen at both lung bases. There is bibasilar
dependent atelectasis, without significant pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Coronary artery calcifications and coronary
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] calcifications are seen. Pacemaker wires are also
present.

There is residual contrast within the kidneys from recent
interventional procedure.

The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, pancreas,
and small bowel are within normal limits. Marked [**Month/Day/Year 1106**]
calcifications are seen of the aorta, celiac axis, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and
iliac/femoral arteries. The gallbladder is not identified, and
the patient may be status post cholecystectomy. There is a small
hiatal hernia present.

There is a large amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage present,
tracking from the right groin to the right posterior pararenal
space. In the greatest axial dimensions, this measures
approximately 7.0 x 7.8 cm in size, and it extends a length of
approximately 20 cm in the SI dimension. There is no significant
abdominal lymph adenopathy present, and no ascites fluid is
present.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Diverticuli are seen, and the
large bowel is otherwise unremarkable in appearance. Hyperdense
free fluid is seen within the pelvis, possibly tracking from the
retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The bladder appears unremarkable,
with a Foley catheter in place.

A right-sided hip replacement is present. No significant osseous
abnormalities are seen aside from degenerative changes and
right-convex scoliosis centered at the thoracolumbar junction.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large right-sided retroperitoneal hemorrhage, extending from
the right groin to the right posterior pararenal space.
2. No significant hemorrhage is seen within the right groin or
extending into the right leg.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 year-old female with a complicated PMHX that includes CAD s/p
LCx stenting in [**2122**], DM type 2, s/p PPM placement for
bradycardia, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, with severe PVD
s/p mutliple interventions, now s/p RLE angiography and right
anterior tibial artery PTCA with post-procedure hypotension and
RP bleed. Transferred to the CCU for further care.

1) Retroperitoneal bleed: Her hypotension was felt secondary to
her retroperitoneal bleed and likely vagal response at the time
of the sheath pull. As mentioned in the HPI, she was transfused
2 units of PRBCs in the cath lab, and was transfused an
additional unit in the CCU. She was also given IVF. She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout her stay in the CCU, without
need for pressors, and her HCT also remained stable following
the 3 units of PRBCs. Coumadin was held in the setting of her RP
bleed, to be restarted as an outpatient. Aspirin was resumed on
[**2125-1-25**] and well tolerated. Her hematocrit was 31.1 at
discharge.

2) s/p PTCA to right [**Doctor First Name **]: She was continued on aspirin while in
hospital. Pedal pulses were present via Doppler. She will
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the week following discharge.

3) CAD: No acute issues in hospital. She was continued on
Lipitor. Aspirin, Atenolol, Diovan, and Lisinopril were
gradually resumed in hospital following the procedure.

4) Mental status change: On arrival to the CCU, Ms. [**Known lastname 9164**] was
noted to be confused, belligerent. Her acute mental status
change was felt most likely medication-related s/p
administration of Fentanyl in the cath lab, sedatives. No gross
electrolyte abnormalities, ABG unremarkable. She responded to
Haldol for acute agitation/confusion. She was alert and oriented
the following morning without recurrence of confusion.

5) Diabetes mellitus type 2: She was kept on a regular insulin
sliding scale in hospital. Her diabetes appears to be
diet-controlled as an out-patient.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83237**] is an 88 yo RH woman with a pMH remarkable for HTN,
CHF and LBD on coumadin (parox AF) p/w a fall 24h prior to
admission at [**Hospital1 18**].

She fell from her rocking chair and struck the LEFT side of her
head and LEFT hand yesterday at noon. She did not loose her
consciousness (as per nurse who saw her in her chair 1 minute
prior to falling). She is usually having falls when attempting
to
walk with her walker. She did have a bilateral hip replacement
and a subsequent LEFT femoral fracture (with residual internal
hip rotation) that impairs her gait (for 2 years).

She remained in the [**Hospital3 **] facility, but started to
become confused. She was taken to [**Hospital3 4107**] today at
around
11:00 am, where she received a CT scan that showed a small (1.
3cm) left frontal intraparenchimal bleed without a midline
shift,
not open to the ventricles, no data of hydrocephalus. At [**Hospital1 **]
her VS were stable. At the time she was confused.  She had an
INR
of 2.97 and received vitamin K 10 mg iv without complications.

Once at [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her VS were  98.6F, 70 bpm, 161/ 71, 16RR, So2
100% in RA. She was alert and oriented *3. Pleasant and
cooperative with the ED team. She received FFP and a new CT CNS
and C-spine scan w/o contrast that showed.

The family denies any previous episodes with focal deficits
eventually resolving. Sh ehas been having viual hallucinations
for 24 months. Those are well formed (people). She talks to
them,
but they do not reply. She has been seeing her husband lately
(he
passed the way 6 months ago).

History of Present Illness:
79M with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma s/p metal biliary stent
placement [**11-8**], who presents with fever x 1 day following
repeat ERCP. Pt is a very poor historian, so most of the history
is obtained through chart review and ED providers. The patient
stated that he had the ERCP done, returned home, felt really
fatigued and unable to walk ([**3-7**] leg pain and weakness). His
wife called 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Denied any chest
pain, abd pain, nausea, vomiting. +fevers to 104 at home, +
chills. No headaches. No LOC, no h/o syncope.
.
Patient had second, outpatient ERCP by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the day
prior to admission due to increasing pruritis and a CT at [**Hospital1 **] that suggesting tumor ingrowth into the stent. He was
pretreated with ampicillin 2gm IV, and gentamicin 80mg IV. ERCP
demonstrated a malignant-appearing biliary stricture affecting
the hilumand right and left ducts. There was debris visible with
in the stent at early cholangiogram. Occulsion cholangiograqm
revealed extensive stricturing of both left and right
intrahepatic ducts. Although a small left intrahepatic radical
opacified, it was not possible to advance the balloon catheter
in this direction. For this reason, no stent could be
introduced. Balloon sweeps were performed from just above the
stent and down through the stent, and a moderate amount of
debris was removed. Even after multiple sweeps, there was some
filling defect left in the upperprotion of the stent, consistent
with a degree of tumor ingrowth. Sticture not amenable to ERCP,
and suggested PTCA as next intervention if futher obstructive
symptoms occur. He was NOT discharged on any anti-biotic ppx.
.
Today pt presents with fever to 103.8, no [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain. no
nausea/no vomiting. c/o fatigue, with reported fevers at home of
103.8--pt took tylenol. In ED, hemodynamically stable.
clinically appears well. wcc is 20. pt was pancultured and
started on levo and flagyl per ercp fellow who review pt in am
for consideration of ir guided drainage if abscess present. ct
in er was equivocal regards to this. pt was therefore admitted
for iv rehydration, iv abx and possible ir procedure. Apparently
had an episode of unresponsiveness in the ED + incontinence.
Stat Head CT ordered--negative. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**] requested a neuro
consult on the floor.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T98.8; HR 63; BP 107/57; rr 16, O2
sat 96%. No nausea/vomting reported. No abdominal pain. Blood cx
sent. IVF given, levo, flagyl given as well. Pt was schdeduled
to go to the regular floor but at 2305; pt was found to be
unresponsive, diaphoretic and incontinent of stool. T 102.0(R);
hr 57; BP 104/45; rr 21 O2 sat 97%2L. BS 246 at the time. Per
nsg report, got up to go to the bathroom, felt off, ? syncopal

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

BOTTLE.
.
surveillance blood cx from [**4-19**] and [**4-20**]: no growth to date
.
EKG:
Sinus rhythm with atrial sensing and ventricular pacing. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are mild dependent
changes at the lung bases. A biliary stent is noted in the
common duct. Moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is
noted. Near the porta hepatis and adjacent to the proximal end
of the biliary stent is an approximately 5.7 x 3.7-cm area of
hypodensity of the hepatic parenchyma with ill-defined borders.
Multiple smaller satellite low-attenuation hepatic foci with
similar ill- defined appearance are noted. There is associated
moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There is no
defined fluid collection and no subcapsular or perihepatic
fluid. There is no ascites or intraperitoneal focal fluid
collection or abscess. The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands,
stomach and bowel are unremarkable. At the upper pole of the
right kidney is a 3.1-cm exophytic lesion which measures 28
Hounsfield units, higher than expected for a simple cyst.
Smaller bilateral parapelvic cysts are noted. There are
bilateral extrarenal pelves. There is no pathologic mesenteric
or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, urinary bladder
and pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable. The prostate is
mildly enlarged. There is no free pelvic fluid or
lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions
are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. 5.7 x 3.7 cm region of low attenuation of the hepatic
parenchyma near the porta hepatis with ill-defined borders and
multiple smaller satellite hypodense foci. These findings are
thought more likely to represent primary cholangiocarcinoma with
intrahepatic metastases. The possibility of superinfection
cannot be definitively excluded. Evaluation with ultrasound
could be helpful to determine if there is a fluid component. If
so, this could be aspirated for diagnostic purposes.
2. Bilateral parapelvic renal cysts.
3. 3.1-cm exophytic lesion of the right kidney measures greater
density than expected for a simple cyst. Ultrasound is suggested
to determine if this is a cyst or possibly a solid lesion.
.
RUQ ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS: There is mild edema within the gallbladder wall which
may be seen with liver disease. The gallbladder is relaxed and
no pericholecystic fluid is identified to suggest cholecystitis.
As noted on prior CT, there is intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. Upper pole cyst is identified on the right kidney
measuring 3.1 cm x 3 cm x 2.1 cm. No fluid collections around
the liver or gallbladder are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. No fluid collections identified in or around the liver or
gallbladder.
2. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation also noted on CT one
day previous.
3. Edema within the gallbladder wall which may be seen with
liver disease. No evidence of acute cholecystitis identified.
.
AP CXR:
Heart size top normal. Lungs clear. No edema or pleural
effusion. Fullness in the mediastinum at the thoracic inlet to
the right of midline could be due to goiter or tortuous head and
neck vessels. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads in standard placements. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.
.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST:
FINDINGS: No definite evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears grossly
preserved. Several areas of relative [**Name (NI) 33214**] is seen
within vessels, including the MCAs and vertebrals, possibly
secondary to recent contrast administration. Visualized
paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. MRI
with diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive in the
evaluation for acute ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Gram negative septicemia due to cholangitis: Bacteremia may
have been secondary to manipulation during ERCP.  RUQ ultrasound
showed no evidence of cholecystitis.  Culture grew enterobacter.
 Patient received ampicillin and gentamicin while in house and
was discharged on po cipro.  Surveillance blood cultures remain
negative.  Plan for total of 14 days of antibiotics.  Patient is
hemodynamically stable.  LFTs are steadily improving.
Percutaneous biliary drain was discussed but was not necessary
given bili trending down with the cleaning of the stent done on
initial ERCP.
.
2) Cholangiocarcinoma/locally metastatic, growing into the
stent, obstructing bile ducts:  Patient is currently under
hospice care.
.
3) Syncope: Pacer was interrogated.  Episode of ? VT noted but
did not temporally correlate with patient's episode.  More
likely this was due to transient hypotension in the setting of
his sepsis.  However, could certainly consider AICD once
bacteremia completely treated given concurrent low EF (EF
20-30%).  However, patient is in hospice and likely would
refuse.  This was not discussed during his inhospital course.
Neuro exam was normal and head CT was negative.  Orthostatics
were negative.  No significant arrhythmias on tele other than a
transient tachycardia EP believes was possibly afib/flutter,
ventricularly paced.
.
4) Renal cyst:  Incidental finding on CT.  Consider follow-up
ultrasound to better characterize, as recommended, if patient
agreeable.
.
5) h/o CAD: Patient is on an aspirin and a beta blocker.  He
denied any chest pain.  His statin was held due to bump in LFTs.
 Could consider restarting at follow-up but likely little
benefit given overall prognosis and patient will continue to be
at risk of recurrent transaminitis.
.
6) h/o colitis: Patient was continued on his home Asacol,
Anaspaz
.
7) ARF: Resolved with IVF.  Likely prerenal.  Please resume
diovan at follow-up visit if creatinine and blood pressure
remain stable.
.
8) Coagulopathy: Resolved with vitamin K.  Inr 1.9 on admit, now
1.4.
.
9) Dispo: discharged home with prior hospice services
.
10) Code status: DNR/DNI

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old right handed woman with a history
of seizures, leukodystrophy, dementia, feeding tube, presenting
as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for status epilepticus.
 This history was taken over the phone from her Daughter;
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25807**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25808**].  She lives at home with her
and the patients husband who are her primary care givers.  She
is bedbound at baseline with quadraparesis with prominent
rightsided weakness.  This morning she was scheduled to see IR
today to have G tube replace at 3 pm.  This morning she had a
questionable small seizure with non responsiveness and quivering
of her lips but it was short lived.  Daughter; felt she had a
low grade temp and a mild cough, but no overt illness. On the
way to [**Hospital3 9717**] she went into a generalized tonic clonic seizure at 2:30
pm with was refractory to 5 mg of ativan, she was intubated at
3:30 for airway protection and was given a paralytic so it was
unclear if she was still seizing.  They got a head ct and
transferred her to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.

lidocaine 70 mg IV x 1
Fentanyl 120 mcg IV x 1
Rocuronium 36 mg IV x 1
Propofol gtt 10 mg / kg/ min
Zosyn 3.375 g IV x 1 sq

As far as her seizure history, they have been fairly well
controlled on Dilantin, with her lat seizure being months ago.
They are often generalized and recover her to come to the
emergency room.  Seizure began around the beginning of her
mental decline and discovery of her leukodystrophy back in 99,
she did have one seizure requiring intubation at that time.
Regarding
her Leukodystrophy, she had genetic testing at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Last Name (un) 18355**]
School, she was tested for common for leukodystrophies and ""they
all came up negative."" But cognitive decline started in 99 with
slurred speech and weakness on one side, and wasn't sure if it
was MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25809**] and then had as seizure, has continued to
decline and has been bedbound for about 6 years.  Currently, her
neurologic baseline is that she has some movement of limbs,
weaker on right side; does move a little bit, but not much, she
fidgets a lot with her hands, rips blankets off and tips.

CXR [**2139-6-3**]:
FINDINGS:  AP portable supine chest radiograph obtained.  The
endotracheal
tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3.4 cm above
the carina.  The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen.
Contrast is seen within large bowel loops in the right upper
quadrant.  Linear areas of plate-like
atelectasis in the right and left lower lungs are noted.  There
is no large consolidation or signs of CHF.  No definite
pneumothorax is present.  The heart and mediastinal contours
appear grossly unremarkable aside from atherosclerotic
calcifications of the aortic knob.  No definite displaced rib
fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned endotracheal and
nasogastric tubes.

CXR [**2139-6-4**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged
position.  There is unchanged mild elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm.  The pre-existing right basal
atelectasis is improved.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No newly appeared
focal parenchymal opacities.


Brief Hospital Course:
64-year-old right handed woman with a history of seizures,
leukodystrophy, dementia, and G tube placement who presented as
a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for status epilepticus.
She had a GTC yesterday afternoon which was refractory to 5mg of
ativan and was subsequently intubated and paralyzed. Head CT
showed severe chronic small vessel disease and atrophy but no
acute intracranial process. Upon transfer she was continuing to
have some intermittent rhythmic movements of the left hand. She
was admitted to the neuro ICU for close monitoring.

ICU and Hospital course:

#Neuro: She was continued on her home Dilantin as well as a
propofol drip overnight and had no further evidence of seizure
activity. She was maintained on continuous EEG monitoring which
showed L sided slowing with polymorphic delta compared with R
sided theta but no epileptiform activity. She was extubated in
the am of [**6-4**] and quickly returned to her baseline, able to
answer simple questions appropriately and follow basic commands.
Dilantin level was 15.4. She received an extra 200mg dilantin on
[**6-4**] and her home dose was increased to 100mgQAM/200QPM 5x/wk
rather than 4x/wk, with 100mg [**Hospital1 **] 2x/wk.

Etiology of her seizure is somewhat unclear at this point.
Infectious w/u has been negative thus far; it is possible she
could have had an underlying low grade viral URI given her
recent hx of cough. Labs unremarkable except for leukocytosis
which is now downtrending.

The patient was transferred to the floor in good condition. The
patient was extubated the day after admission and did well over
the weekend, however on [**6-8**] the patient spiked a temp and was
found to have a white count of 19 (see below). She began having
more seizures that responded acutely to ativan. She was
frequently somnolent following the seizures - which had a unique
semiology, including rather purposeful picking at covers and
items real and imagined on her bed, waving her hand in the air
as if being attacked by flies, and looking off into the corner
of the room, often up and to the left.

She received several boluses of Dilantin and her dose was
increased to 300 mg total daily. A steady level was difficult to
obtain and she was switched to infatabs that could be crushed
and administered via g-tube. The patient tolerated this
transition well with improved level. Her medications and
seizures were discussed with her daughter and husband who care
for her, as well as her primary doctor who has been managing her
dilantin. Plan was made to continue at 300 mg total daily with
plans to recheck the level in the week following discharge. The
patient did generally well through the rest of her
hospitalization with a single seizure the day prior to discharge
for which she received an extra dose of dilantin with a level up
to 14.4 on discharge.

# Infectious disease: She initially had some low grade fevers
with a Tmax of 100.3. UA and CXR were unremarkable. Blood
cultures were negative. She was continued on her home Bactrim
for chronic UTI.  On transfer to the floor she became more
somnolent related in part to being post-ictal and also due to a
new fever up to 103, as well as an elevated WBC count and
inflammatory markers. A CXR revealed bilateral aspiration
pneumonias, likely related to her seizures. These were treated
with empiric antibiotics with significant clinical improvement
withing 36 hours. A PICC line was placed and Cefepime and Vanco
were coursed conitnued for 4 more days following discharge (~ 10
day course).

# FEN/GI: She was maintained NPO as at baseline does not take
anything by mouth. She received her medications and tube feeds
via her PEG.  Her temporary PEG tube was replaced by IR aas it
had fallen out the week prior and was due to be replaced as an
outpatient. A foley had been placed there temporarily. The
patient tolerated the new tube well.

# Cardiovascular: She was maintained on telemetry monitoring.
She was continued on her home antihypertensives.

# Pulmonary: She was successfully extubated on [**6-4**] and remained
stable from a respiratory standpoint. CXR was clear. Subsequent
aspiration PNA as above.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive, perseverative,
intermittently follows commands.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.
Neuro: Mental status as above, intermixed appropriate and
inappropriate responses to questions, pseudobulbar. CNs intact.
Strength is at least antigravity and against some resistance in
all extremities, left greater than right.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**2139-6-3**] after a prolonged seizure. She was initially
admitted to the ICU,, requiring a mechanical respirations while
her seizures came under control. She was transferred to the
floor and had another seizure and subsequently developed
bilateral aspiration pneumonias. She was treated with IV
antibiotics and her Dilantin was increased.

A large IV was placed for her to get medicine at home and her
G-tube was replaced.

Because we had trouble maintaining an accurate level with her
Dilantin we switched to the infatabs and increased her dose to
100 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening every day. Her
level the morning of discharge was 11.2 and she was given an
extra 200 mg, which should bring her level up above 15.  Next
week she should follow up with her primary doctor and get a
level drawn. The Visiting nurses who will remove her PICC line
may be able to do this for you.

ADDENDUM:  While on the floor, the patient developed
hypotension and diaphoresis.  A code was called.  The patient
was intubated and taken to the unit.  At that point, the
patient put out melenic stools.  A NG tube was dropped with
coffee ground.  The patient's hematocrit stabilized and she
was not scoped.  Her GI bleed was felt to be related to the
aspirin, Plavix, plus Relafen.  All three medications were
held.  The patient experienced a left pneumothorax during
left subclavian line attempt.  She did not require a chest
tube and the pneumothorax is resolving on its own.

The patient was restarted on aspirin and Protonix.  During
this episode of hypotension, systolic to the 80s, the
patient's stroke progressed as evidenced by MRI and further
weakness in her left arm and loss of gag reflex.  In
addition, she experienced a non ST elevation MI, felt to be
related to demand ischemia.  Peak CK was 323, peak troponin
31.0.  The patient was extubated without difficulty and
called out to the floor.

Her systolic blood pressures were maintained by holding
antihypertensives with the exception of a beta blocker.  For
the loss of her gag reflex, the patient was kept n.p.o. and
started on tube feeds via NG tube.  A PEG was placed by
Interventional Radiology on [**2176-7-17**].  The Stroke Team
reevaluated the patient and felt that she would not tolerate
further anticoagulation necessary for carotid stent
placement.  They will follow-up with her, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], in the stroke clinic in four to six weeks after
discharge to reconsider a carotid stent with Plavix.  The
patient developed copious secretions with her impaired
swallow mechanism and a scopolamine patch was started with
excellent effect.

Her blood sugars were difficult to control and the [**Last Name (un) **]
Team was consulted and an acceptable regimen of NPH 30 units
q.a.m. and q.h.s. with a sliding scale was deemed adequate
control.  The patient had a slightly elevated white count
prior to discharge.  Her U/A was positive with a pH of 9.0
suggesting Proteus.  Ciprofloxacin was started.  The patient
will be discharged to [**Hospital3 7**].

ADDITIONAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Loss of gag reflex secondary to cerebrovascular accident,
subsequent placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube by Interventional Radiology on [**2176-7-17**].
2.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
3.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed in the context of aspirin,
Plavix, and Relafen.
4.  Urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atorvostatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lansoprazole 30 mg per G tube b.i.d.
5.  Scopolamine patch transdermal q. 72 hours.
6.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. 12 hours for a 14 day
course, last dose [**2176-8-1**].
7.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.
8.  Acetaminophen p.r.n.
9.  Insulin NPH 30 units q.a.m., 30 units q.h.s.
10. Insulin sliding scale as follows:  Fingersticks 80-100
covered with 4 units; fingersticks 101-150 with 6 units;
fingersticks 151-200 with 8 units; fingersticks 201-250 to be
covered with 10 units; fingersticks 251-300 with 12 units;
fingersticks 301-350 with 14 units; fingersticks 351 to 400
with 16 units; fingersticks greater than 400 with 18 units of
regular insulin.

All the above medications may be given per NG tube.  Ideally,
the patient will be restarted on an ACE inhibitor once her
requirement for systolic blood pressure greater than 130
related to her CVA has passed.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo female with h/o a Atrial Fibrillation, s/p bioprosthetic
mitral valve replacement, admitted with post-op bleeding
following dental extraction and palate I and D two days prior to
the admission in the setting of being anticoagulated (INR in
therapeutic range).
.
# Bleeding: Post-op due to anticoagulation with warfarin use for
atrial fibrillation. Bleeding started on [**11-2**], increased [**11-3**]
in ED packed and pressure applied. INR 2.7, and hematocrit 27,
SBP in the 80's to 90's.  Hematocrit lowest at 21 on admission.
Bleeding from posterior palate Incision and drainage site.
Bleeding resolved with no events in the ICU. HD stable. Last
transfusion on [**2123-11-4**]. Received 2 units of FFP, one unit of
PRBC, fluid boluses and vitamin K. To medicine floor at
Hematocrit stable [**11-6**], but that night encountered bleeding
from I&D site, Afrin spray applied and pressure with resolution,
no PRBC's given, hematocrit 27.7. No further bleeding during
course of admission. Coumadin restarted [**11-10**] as per instruction
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. 3 mg initial dose, given risk for
stroke in patient with A-fibb. As per wishes of patient and
family, patient remained in house until incision site appeared
healed, INR increased and no evidence of bleed. Discharged with
follow-up by cardiology and her oral surgeon. Clindamycin 450 PO
Q6 for abscess stopped after IV then PO course for 10 days.
Coumadin increased to 5 mg on discharge.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate control with beta-blocker. Continue
Statin/ beta-blocker. Held Coumadin until [**11-10**] when restarted
given decreasing concern of rebleed. In discussion with Dr.
[**Name (NI) **], pt's Cardiologist in regards to anticoagulation.
.
# CHF: EF >65% in 1/[**2123**]. Continued beta-blocker. Restarted
[**Year (4 digits) 11573**] per outpatient dose 4 days into admission. Had been held
in MICU given hypotension. Fluids also given. Held Aldactone
during admission given elevated potassium and hypotension. With
increasing work of breathing 3 days prior to discharge, evidence
of increasing overload on CXR, [**Year (4 digits) 11573**] given. Pt stable on 40 PO
[**Year (4 digits) 11573**] and resuming 25 Aldacton [**Hospital1 **] at discharge with follow-up
in the heart failure clinic.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
2. Small amount of free perihepatic fluid.
3. Collapsed gallbladder with wall edema and small amount of
pericholecystic
fluid. These findings could be due to a variery of chronic
conditions
including hypoalbuminemia, chf, or can be seen in hepatitis.
There is no
evidence to suggest acute inflammation.
.
CXR: [**2114-12-18**]
Very severe heterogeneous opacification has developed in the
left upper lobe.  Left lower lobe was collapsed in [**Month (only) 1096**], now
reexpanded and densely consolidated. There may be left hilar
adenopathy and small left pleural effusion. Overall, findings
are consistent with extensive pneumonia though under the
appropriate clinical circumstances, this could be infiltrated
malignancy. Small region of ground-glass opacity in the right
apex persists since the chest CT done on [**2114-1-13**].
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding and right lung
shows some mild vascular redistribution but I do not believe
pulmonary edema is playing any role.
.
-[**2114-12-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknessis is normal. There is normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

-[**2114-12-24**] CT chest:
1. Multifocal pneumonia, comparable in extent to the appearance
on the chest radiograph, [**12-23**], which has progressed since
[**12-18**]. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
comparable and not of sufficient size to suggest empyema. There
are no characteristics of the widespread pulmonary infection, to
permit discriminating among possible causes: virus, bacteria, or
fungus.
2. Minimal increase in size and number of mediastinal lymph
nodes, presumably reactive. More substantial left hilar
adenopathy cannot be excluded, but if present, is not
obstructive, and is equally likely to be reactive.
3. New tiny right middle lobe lung nodule.
4. Small pleural and pericardial effusions could be sympathetic
to infection, or residual from prior cardiogenic edema

Multiple areas of restricted diffusion are seen in both cerebral
hemispheres involving frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. No
focal acute infarcts are seen within the posterior fossa. The
distribution is in the watershed region in the left frontal
lobe, but otherwise, it is in the cortical and subcortical
region of both cerebral hemispheres. There is no acute
hemorrhage identified. There is no mass effect, midline shift or
hydrocephalus. Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy is seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple small acute cortical and subcortical infarcts
including infarct in the left frontal watershed distribution as
described above. Mild diffuse decreased signal within the bony
structures of the head could be due to marrow hyperplasia or
infiltration and clinical correlation recommended.
MRA OF THE NECK: Neck MRA shows normal flow in carotid and
vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
  IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the neck.
MRA HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow in the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation.
  IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo with myelodysplastic syndrome (RARS), presently D15C5
azacitidine presenting with fever, neutropenia, profound anemia,
diarrhea and cough with fever, lung exam concerning for PNA.
.
Respiratory Distress: Patient presented with profound anemia
likely secondary to her MDS. She received 5 UPRBC with
improvement of her HCT from 13.6 on admission to 23.2. She
developed respitratory distress likely secondary to combined
insult of her pneumonia and volume overload for which she
triggered. She was found to be in flash pulmonary edema. She
received supportive therapy. Her respiratory status improved and
she was transferred to the floor. She was started on albuterol
nebulizer treatement for possible bronchospasm, but this may not
need to be continued at the rehabilitation facility.
.
PNA/recurrent fevers: She had presented to clinic where she was
found to be febrile to 102 and neutropenic. a CXR showed a Left
lower lobe pneumonia. She was started on vancomycin and
cefepime. A DFA was negative. Blood cultures were negative. In
the interim, the patient was managed with meropenem,
voriconazole, azithromycin, and vancomcyin in the setting of
recurrent fevers and night sweats. She was discharged after
being afebrile for 1-2 days, with a short course of meropenem to
be completed.
.
MDS/Anemia: She has a history of sideroblastic anemia for which
she is on azacitidine. She received 5 units of pRBC over the
first 2 days of her hospitalization. There was a consideration,
given the recurrent fevers and night sweats, that the patient
had a hematologic etiology, perhaps transformation to AML.  A
smear was obtained and was unremarkable, so bone marrow biopsy
was deferred. She received a unit of pRBC on the day of
discharge, which she completed prior to transfer to
rehabilitation.
.
Altered mental status/right hand-wrist weakness: The patient
developed right hand/wrist weakness on [**12-26**]. The patient also
developed attention/cognitive deficits. An MR head was obtained
which showed a likely watershed infarct in the left frontal
cortex, with multiple focal lesions in both hemispheres. LP was
negative for meningitis. TTE bubble study was negative for PFO
or ASD. EEG was performed with results pending at time of
discharge. Her mental status improved considerably and she had a
clear thought process, and was consistently oriented to her
name, the name of her hospital, and the month/year.
.
LFT elevation: Hepatitis serologies were negative, as were
smooth Antibodies. She did have a positive [**Doctor First Name **] with titer
pending. Hepatic US showed Small amount of free perihepatic
fluid, collapsed gallbladder with wall edema, and small amount
of pericholecystic fluid. LFTs were improved by day of
discharge.
.
Neutropenic Fever: Her neutropenia was likely secondary to her
chemotherapy. She was placed on neutropenic precautions and her
ANC was trended.  Her neutropenia resolved with periodic dosing
of neupogen. She had had no fevers for 1-2 days prior to
discharge. Per ID recommendations, she was discharged on
meropenem, to be continued for six days following discharge.
.
Prophylaxis: She did not receive heparin SQ prophylactically
given the contraindication posed by her azacitidine therapy.  As
her platelet count remained normal, and there was no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage on imaging, SC heparin was given for DVT
prophylaxis.

Date of Birth:  [**2107-2-15**]        Sex:  M

Service:  OME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 70-year-old
male with extensive locally recurrent melanoma involving his
face, status post excision, neck dissection and radiation
therapy.  Initial staging was consistent with stage III C
disease but now with mets to the lung, bone and soft tissue.
He was due to be started on high-dose IL-2 but in clinic on
[**2178-1-12**], he was noticed to have erythema in an area of
recent lymph node dissection felt consistent with cellulitis,
and was started on oral Keflex, and now is presenting with
worsening erythema.  The patient reports that in the week
since he started antibiotics, the erythema has enlarged and
become more red.  In clinic today, his white blood cell count
was up to 20,000 and he was admitted to OMED service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, metastatic melanoma with
original diagnosis in [**2177-6-5**].  On [**2177-8-21**] he underwent
wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy, with
melanoma present in 1 left intraparotid node.  On [**2177-8-28**]
he had re-excision of the left temple and cheek area and a
left radical neck dissection, with melanoma in 7 of 69 total
lymph nodes.  He underwent radiation therapy to the forehead
area, completing 20 fractions over 4 weeks.  He then
developed soft tissue nodule superior to the graft, that
might have represented residual melanoma and appeared to have
reduced in size with radiation.

In late [**2177-10-6**] a PET CT showed increased glucose
uptake at sites of surgery on his thigh and around the
superior edge of the graft on his face.  He was seen in
follow-up one of three weeks after completion of radiation.
Follow up head MRI and torso CT on [**2178-1-7**] revealed no
metastatic brain lesions, but metastatic disease in his
chest, left axilla, mediastinum and lung, as well as a T12
sclerotic focus felt consistent with melanoma.  The BRCA
mutation testing on his tumor was negative.  He has passed
screening tests to begin high-dose IL-2 therapy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Enalapril 20 mg p.o. daily,
pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily, Keflex 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Reveals an elderly male
in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round,
reactive to light.  Left temporal and buccal graft without
erythema.  NECK:  Well-healed scar from posterior auricular
area to the left upper chest.  No signs of wound dehiscence.
Broad area of erythema and corresponding area warm to touch.
No palpable masses or fluid collections.  No cervical,
supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.  HEART:  Regular
rate and rhythm, S1, S2.  CHEST:  No dullness to percussion
and clear to auscultation bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Positive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well
perfused, 1+ edema to [**12-8**] the way up shins bilaterally, 2+ DP
and PT pulses.  NEUROLOGIC EXAM:  Nonfocal.

ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 20.9, hemoglobin 11.7, hematocrit 33.7,
platelet count 206,000, BUN 20, creatinine 1.2, sodium 134,
potassium 6.1, chloride 101, CO2 23, glucose 117.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with cellulitis
and was placed on IV vancomycin.  Doxycycline was added when
he did not appear to be improving.  Unasyn was added when the
cellulitic area continued to worsen.  He also became short of
breath and was treated with Lasix.  Transthoracic echo
revealed diastolic heart failure and he was continued on
enalapril and Lasix.  He had an ID consult on [**1-28**] who
suggested stopping the Unasyn, changing to cefepime and
adding vancomycin back.  Blood cultures remained negative and
he was afebrile throughout this time.  Derm consult on [**1-28**]
was obtained due to persistent rash, and a biopsy was
performed consistent with melanoma.  He was subsequently
transferred to the biologic service on [**2178-1-30**] to begin
high-dose IL-2 therapy.

During this week he received 7 of 14 doses with 7 doses held
related to tachycardia and pulmonary edema.  On treatment day
#4, he was tachypneic with hypoxia to the mid 80s.  Chest x-
ray was consistent with bilateral pleural effusions.
Throughout the day he became increasingly more tachypneic and
fatigued, and was transferred to the ICU.  He was treated
with Lasix with improvement in his respiratory status.  An
echocardiogram on [**2178-2-3**] showed a small pericardial
effusion with question tamponade physiology.  Cardiology was
consulted and felt they were not able to tap the effusion.
He underwent a cardiac MRI on [**2178-2-4**] revealing no cardiac
metastases and no tamponade physiology.

He developed SVT to the 140s on [**2178-2-4**], which
spontaneously improved with a fluid bolus.  His respiratory
status improved with continued diuresis, and he was
transferred back to the floor on [**2178-2-5**].  Lasix and
enalapril were continued and he was weaned to room air with
O2 saturations in the mid 90s.

Physical therapy consult was initiated and he was ambulating
short distances with a steady gait.  He was discharged to
home on [**2178-2-7**] with a plan to follow up in clinic on
[**2178-2-10**].

Other side effects related to IL-2 included rigors improved
with Demerol; fatigue; and hypotension on treatment day 3,
requiring fluid boluses.  During this week he developed acute
renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.0 with associated
oliguria.  He developed metabolic acidosis with a minimum
bicarb of 18, improved with bicarbonate boluses.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
Strict I & Os and serum chemistries were maintained.  IV
fluids were continued given acute renal failure.

During this week he had mild ST elevation to 54, which
improved prior to discharge.  He had no hyperbilirubinemia,
myocarditis or coagulopathy noted.  He was thrombocytopenic
to a platelet count low of 68,000 without evidence of
bleeding.  He was anemic and was transfused with packed red
blood cells with discharge hemoglobin of 9.1.  By [**2178-2-7**]
he had recovered from side effects to allow for discharge to
home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Alert, oriented and ambulatory.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with his family.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Metastatic melanoma status post cycle 1, week 1, high-
    dose IL-2 therapy complicated by pulmonary edema, and

diabetes insipidus, probably from lithium use. She suffered a
perforated colon approximately 6 months ago due to C-
difficile colitis incidentally found at her operation for
gross peritonitis was an ileal carcinoid which was resected
and had positive nodal metastases. She has been
intolerant of her ileostomy due to food and electrolyte
issues and has been in the hospital for renal failure on two
occasions on the medicine service despite trying her best to
manage her fluid intake herself. She also has extensive skin
excoriation and dermatitis problems due to her ileostomy. She
is, therefore, electively brought in for ileostomy reversal.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old man with trasnufsion dependent
myelodysplastic disorder, normal pressure hydrocephalus, DM,
CAD, HTN who is electively admitted for Allo SCT.
.
He was last seen in clinic [**5-30**] w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for preadmission
testing prior to planned admission today for a non-myeloablative
matched unrelated donor transplant for his MDS that is
associated with pancytopenia and transfusion dependence of both
red cells and platelets. Last transfusion [**5-28**]. Due to multiple
transfusions, he has develoepd Fe overload, and has been on
chelation therapy with deferasirox. He is admitted for protocol
driven reduced intensity MUD allo. The conditioning is to
inlcude clofarabine, total nodal radiation and ATG. The donor
match is 9/10 per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] progress note.

Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 3588**] clinic evaluation on [**5-23**] this pt has an
absolute neutropenia. [**10/2164**] he was admitted to the ICU with
CAP/neutropenic fevers based upon chest imaging findings and
ROS. He was treated with vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin,
no pathogen was isolated. During that hospitalization, he was
diagnosed with HSV 1 outbreak on his neck (no lesions in his
mouth or periorally), and was also diagnosed with insulin
dependent DM-2.
.
On the floor, he complains of ongoing seasonal allergies with
dry dcough and watery eyes. Cough is non-productive. He has not

IMAGES
======
Head CT [**2165-6-13**]
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage,
parenchymal edema, or mass effect. A right frontal approach
ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter is again identified, in
unchanged position, with tip traversing the septum pellucidum
and terminating in the left lateral ventricle. The ventricles
are again symmetrically prominent, not changed in size from
prior studies. There is no shift of midline structures, and
there is no effacement of the basal cisterns. There is no CT
evidence of territorial infarct. Osseous structures remain
unremarkable, and the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids
are clear. Cavernous carotid calcifications are noted.
.
Renal Ultrasound [**2165-6-13**]
No hydronephrosis or other findings to explain acute renal
failure.
.
CT chest [**2165-6-16**]
1. Multifocal pneumonia which may be bacterial or fungal, with
vasculitis a less likely consideration.
2. Left adrenal nodule, stable compared with 10/10.
3. Right renal stone, uncomplicated.
4. Diverticulosis.
.
Abdominal ultrasound [**2165-6-18**]
1. Normal abdominal ultrasound without gallbladder or biliary
pathology.
2. Echogenic focus in the interpolar region of right kidney
likely represents milk of calcium though a nonobstructing renal
calculi is a possibility.
.
MRI head w/o contrast [**2165-6-18**]
1. High signal on FLAIR images within the cerebral sulci may be
secondary to recent lumbar puncture, although infectious
leptomeningitis cannot be excluded by imaging. High signal on
FLAIR images within the dura may be related to the recent lumbar
puncture or the VPS, but infectious pachymeningitis cannot be
excluded by imaging. Correlation with CSF analyses is
recommended.
2. No evidence for cerebritis or PRES.
3. Stable moderate ventriculomegaly. Stable VPS tip position.
4. Bilateral small superior parietal subdural collections, right
greater than left, similar to [**2165-6-13**] but new since [**2164-12-25**].
They may represent hygromas secondary to the VPS. However,
chronic subdural hematomas cannot be excluded.
.
CT Torso [**2165-6-22**]
IMPRESSION: 1. Coalescent consolidation of previous multifocal
nodular opacities within the lungs. Innumerable bilateral
submillimeter nodules with ground-glass attenuation distributed
throughout both lungs with relative sparing of the periphery.
Overall findings are concerning for semi-invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis. No cavitation noted within these coalescent areas
of consolidation. Findings in the chest have progressed
significantly since prior imaging. 2. Indeterminate left adrenal
gland lesion. Further characterization with MR recommended. 3.
Non-obstructing 4-mm right renal calculus. No intra-abdominal
collection identified.

Echo [**2165-6-23**]
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with global free
wall hypokinesis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. Compared to
the findings of the prior study of [**2165-5-16**], left and right
ventricular systolic function have deteriorated significantly.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old M with transfusion dependent MDS, D+7 s/p allo SCT,
normal pressure hydrocephalus, CAD, HTN and diabetes, who was
initially electively admitted for allo SCT with clofarabine,
total nodal radiation and anti-thymoglobulin. His course was
complicated by febrile neutropenia and renal failure.

His creatinine was 1.1 on admission and rose to > 5 following
administration of clofarabine per SCT protocol. He developed
metabolic acidosis and worsening confusion over the course of
several days leading up to his transplant. On SCT day +1, he was
febrile and started on vancomycin and cefepime. On SCT day +3,
he was transferred to ICU for worsening mental status, increased
respiratory distress, and renal failure. He remained febrile and
was seen by the ID consult team and transitioned to meropenem +
levofloxacin + voriconazole. He was intubated electively for
multiple procedures including MRI, VP shunt tap (by
neurosurgery), and bronchoscopy and extubated the following day.
He was started on ambisome in place of voriconazole for positive
galactomannan on BAL (presumed aspergillosis pneumonia). He was
seen by the neprhology team and started on HD for presumed
clofarabine toxicity. Mental status improved and he was called
out to the BMT service.

However, two days later he was at dialysis when he developed an
episode of altered mental status associated with tachycardia,
hypertension and hypoxia to 88% on 2L NC. His respiratory status
continued to decline and he was reintubated and transferred to
the ICU. In addition, he became hypotensive requiring pressors
for a few hours; pressors were eventually weaned off, although
he then developed shock liver and probable DIC requiring
multiple transfusions. Due to electrolyte derangements CVVH was
started as well.  His abx were broadened to double cover
aspergillus (posaconazole+ambisome), vanc was changed to dapto
for VRE coverage, bactrim was added for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 21150**].

At approximately 3:12 AM on [**2165-6-24**], housestaff were called to
evaluate the patient after his nurse noticed his A-line pressure
[**Location (un) 1131**] dropped abruptly to SBP in the 10s-20s. On evaluation,
he was unresponsive and did not have palpable pulses. At that
time, back board was placed beneath patient and CPR was
initiated. Pulseless electrical activity was noted on the
monitor at interval 2-minute pulse checks (no shockable rhythm).
He received epinephrine 1 mg IV x 2 doses at five minutes apart.
 Housestaff notified the patient's wife, who requested that the
resuscitation be stopped. At this time, CPR was stopped and he
did not receive further vasopressors.  He did not regain a
pulse. The monitor continued to show pulseless electrical
activity for several minutes with slowing heart rate until
asystole. At that time, the patient was examined and was noted
to have no audible breath or heart sounds. His pupils were fixed
and dilated to ~5mm. There were not signs of life evident. The
time of death was noted to be 3:23 AM.  Attending physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) **] was notified of the above events. The patient's wife was
then contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding an autopsy and agreed to autopsy.

Chief Complaint:
Biliary obstuction.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
IR guided biliary drain

History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 yo man transferred from OSH [**11-4**] for ERCP for
biliary obstruction with obstructive hepatopathy. presented to
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**11-3**] with increasing shortness of breath,
dizziness, and jaundice. Per OSH also reported fevers, chills,
and nausea. Had gveen given bactrim for a UTI one week prior. He
underwent an abdomen CT which showed intrahepatic and
extrahepatic obstruction likely secondary to metastatic cancer
to the pancreatic head. He was started on flagyl, zosyn, and
vanc and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.

While being prepped for ERCP (while under MAC) and turned prone
he regurgitated coffee-brown material so he was electively
intubated due to concern for his risk of aspiration. They
proceded with ERCP, but were unable to cannulate the biliary
tree. A dudodenal stent was placed due to external compression
of the duodenum. He was placed on propofol for sedation and his
SBP's dropped to the 80's in the PACU. He was started on neo
through a PIV for pressure support.

In the ICU the neo was rapidly weaned and he was extubated
easily [**11-5**]. It was thought that his inability to extubate
post-procedure and hypotension were due to sedation rather than
aspiration given his rapid improvement.

ROS: 10 point review of systems negative except as noted above.

one or more nodules in the left lung. A band of atelectasis is
present at the base of the right lung which is otherwise clear.
Heart is mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right, are likely present.
An apparent bulge in the right mediastinal contour could be a
skin fold instead. Repeat radiographs, conventional if possible,
recommended when feasible.
.
ERCP [**11-4**]: A large amount of gastric fluid was found when the
endoscope was passed into the stomach, suggestive of outflow
tract obstruction.
Unable to pass the scope to the second part of the duodenum due
to obstruction, most likely extrinsic compression from colon
cancer metastases. A duodenal stent ( 9cm x22mm Wallflex enteral
duodenal stent) was placed successfully under fluoroscopic
guidance to alleviate the gastric outlet obstruction. Ref 6502.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 88 yo male with pmh of metastatic colon
cancer and hypertension who is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to
hypotension and need for continued intubation s/p ERCP attempt
for biliary obstruction.
.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive after intubation on
propofol. Likely secondary to propofol, however also in the
differential is hypotension from sepsis. He has two potential
sources for sepsis: biliary obstruction and recent apsiration.
Also could have volume depletion. Since coming to the floor his
pressures had recovered and phenylephrine weaned off. Given the
possibility of sepsis, he was started on vancomycin, flagyl and
cefepime, but then changed to ceftriaxone and flagyl.  The
vancomycin was discontinued after the cultures were negative x
48 horus.  On the day before discharge he was transitioned to PO
levofloxacin to complete a full course through [**11-11**], cultures no
growth to date at discharge.
.
# Biliary obstruction/obstructive jaundice: The patient
underwent a CT at the OSH which showed intrahepatic and
extrahepatic bile duct dilatation likely due to a metastasis to
the pancreatic head from his colon cancer. He failed ERCP due to
external compression of the duodenum limiting their ability to
pass the scope.  A duodenal stent was placed by the ERCP team to
help to decompress the gastric outlet obstruction.  Given the
failed ERCP attempt, IR was consulted and performed an IR guided
biliary drain on [**2199-11-6**].  He was transferred to the floor and
his LFTs trended down after the stent was placed.  His drain was
clamped on [**11-8**] and with continued improvement of his liver
tests and symptoms.  He was discharged with a clamped biliary
drain to follow up with interventional radiology.  If symptoms
return, the drain can be unclamped to a bag.
.
# Respiratory distress: The patient presented to the ICU
intubated since the ERCP. On the following morning he was
successfully extubated and breathing appropriately on room air.
.
# Anemia, chronic disease: The patient was noted to have
coffe-ground regurgitation during the ERCP procdure. He was
anemic with a Hct of 26 at the OSH and 25 on admission labs
here. Vit B12 and folate normal at the OSH. Fe low, but other Fe
studies not sent. Haptoglobin high makes hemolysis unlikely.
Most likely due to anemia of chronic disease and possibly due to
oncologic treatment. Started an IV PPI due to concern for coffee
ground regurgitant.  His hematocrits were stable and did not
need transfusions.
.
# Metastatic colon cancer: Patient has multiple mets seen on OSH
imaging. He will follow up with his outpatient surgeon after
discharge.
.
# Hypertension, benign: stable

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 104299**] was underwent a CT scan in the ED for c/o abdominal
pain. Her CT scan revealed a small bowel obstruction near her
known ventral hernia which was reducible at the beside. General
surgery was consulted, and she was admitted to the ICU found to
have junctional brady rhythm with prolonged QT (QTc near 600) in
context of recent increase in Flecainide dose per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
monitored in the ICU for a few days. Cardiology was consulted,
and recommended holding beta blocker, and flecanide. Coumadin
was also held in case of need for surgical intervention. In
addition, her Potassium of 2.9 and Magnesium were aggressively
repleted. Her cardiac status stabilized after undergoing
diuresis with Diamox, however, her abdominal exam worsened over
the following 48 hours after a few days of conservative
management with NPO/NGT for decompression and IV antibiotics.
.
She was taken to the OR, and underwent lysis of adhesions and
small bowel resection.
Her operative course was uncomplicated, routinely observed in
the PACU, and transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where cardiac monitoring
and electrolyte correction occurred. She was transfused post/op
with 2 U PRBC. HCTs remained stable thereafter. She was
extubated and wean off pressors, and transferred to Stone 5.
.
Physical therapy was consulted upon transfer to Stone 5 for
expected discharge to REHAB due to physical deconditioning.
Remained NPO until bowel function resumed. Electrolytes checked
and repleted daily. Hyponatremia resolved gradually. Started on
sips of water, advanced to clear liquids. Noted to have
difficulty swallowing and clearing secretions. Bedside Swallow
study conducted. She was taken for Video swallow, and cleared
for regular diet with thick liquids, and whole pills in puree.
Patient reported passing flatus, and incontinent of loose, brown
stools. Rectal tube inserted on [**2140-4-2**] due to frequencey of
bowel movements, and risk for compromise of perineal skin.
Rectal tube should be removed by Friday [**2140-4-8**] to prevent
rectal breakdown. Diet advanced to regular food. Reported
intermittent nausea and lack of appetite which has persisted
throughout post-op recovery.  Foley was removed. She was able to
urinate, incontinent of urine. UA and urine cultures negative.
.
Mobility compromised. She requires [**1-26**] people for ambulation and
transfer. Requires aggressive physical Rehab, and monitoring of
Nutritional, bowel, and cardiac status. She should follow-up
with PCP (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2450**]), and cardiology to address cardiac
events (prolonged QT interval) during this admission. [**Hospital 197**]
clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] manages the patients coumadin dosing for PAF.
Coumadin 2mg Po given at [**2140-4-4**]. INR should be checked on
[**2140-4-5**], and daily until therapeutic. Goal INR [**1-26**].
.
She will require to have the incisional staples removed in
another week. This can be done per REHAB facility after
authorization per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (surgeon).

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 y/o African American gentleman who has a past medical
history significant for DMII (most recent HbA1c:11.8 on
[**2105-3-28**]), HTN, and BPH who initially presented with
dysarthria, weakness and change in bladder habits. Pt was in his
normal state of health until about a week ago when he began to
notice an increase in the number of times he had to urinate.
Although he has nocturia at baseline (usually wakes 3-4 times
per week to use the bathroom at night), he began to use the
bathroom during the day with increasing frequency, every 15-20
minutes. He found that he was urinating only a very small
amount, ""several drops"" each time and felt like he had not
completely emptied his bladder.
Then, on [**2105-7-14**], the patient woke up and felt generally weak.
He noticed his speech was slurred and his legs felt unsteady
when getting up from bed. The weakness came on all of a sudden
and he felt a cramping fatigue worst in his calves. He had no
trouble understanding others or finding words, but noticed his
pronunciation of words was impaired. In addition, he also felt
intermittently very cold and then very hot. When his partner
arrived home, she too immediately noticed the changes in his
speech and brought him to the ED at [**Hospital3 **].

At [**Hospital1 **] initial VS were: 98.2 72 156/82 14 98% on RA. He was
observed to have altered mental status, raising suspicion for
possible TIA or stroke. Head CT was normal. Lab work was notable
for Cr 10.4, K 8.4. He received 2 grams Ca-gluconate, 10 units
of insulin and D50, sodium bicarbonate, and 15 mg PO Kayakelate.
He was found to be in acute renal failure with hyperkalemia,
with EKG changes notable for peaked T waves. Suspecting the need
for emergent dialysis he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Pt arrived to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] where he was alert and oriented
x3 At [**Hospital1 18**], he presented with SBPS to 190.  Electrolyte
abnormalities not improved.  EKG with persistently peaked t
waves.  He was transfered to the MICU and treated medically
without need for hemodialysis.  Foley was placed with over 500cc
relieved.  DRE showed prostate enlargement, symmetric in nature.
 In the MICU serial ekg's normalized.  He proceeded to have
brisk urine output.  Potassium normalized and Cr trending
downward.

He has had chronic knee pain for which he takes acetaminophen;
he also takes a nightly ibuprofen-containing sleep aid for
insomnia.


Past Medical History:
-Hyperlipidemia
-Hypertension: Stress ECHO ([**2105-7-1**]) with normal LV wall
[**Last Name (LF) 93024**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]=60%, no LVH, normal stress response
-Non-insulin dependent DM II: HbA1c=11.8 ([**2105-3-28**])


Social History:
Pt is a bus driver for children with special needs. He lives
alone, but has a partner with whom he is very close. He has
three grown children and three grandchildren. He denies a
history of tobacco or cigarette use. He drinks socially, [**3-22**]
times per week; 6 shots of vodka/week. He denies any history of
illicit drug use.

Imaging Studies
Renal Ultrasound ([**2105-7-15**])
1. No hydronephrosis.  Bilateral tiny simple renal cysts noted.
2. Incidentally noted, the liver is diffusely echogenic,
consistent with fatty infiltration.  Other forms of liver
disease and more advanced liver disease including significant
hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o African American male with a PMH of DMII and HTN who
presented with generalized weakness, altered mental status,
slurred speech and increased frequency of small amounts of
urination.  He was found to be in acute renal failure at an OSH
and transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible hemodialysis.  He was
stabilized medically in the ICU until [**7-16**] when his care was
transitioned to the general medicine service.

**ACUTE ISSUES**
# Acute Renal Failure: He presented in acute renal failure with
creatinine of 10.4 (baseline 0.9), hyperkalemia, and EKG
changes.   His ARF was largely attributed to obstruction as he
was retaining over 500cc urine and found to have large symmetric
prostate on DRE.  However, no hydronephrosis seen on ultrasound.
 Additionally, he was also on a number of potentially
nephrotoxigenic medications causing ATN, including lisinopril,
NSAIDs, and potassium citrate. He was initially medically
managed in the ICU IVF, lasix, bicarb with good effect.  Renal
function gradually improved over several days following catheter
placement, fluid support, and discontinuation of nephrotoxigenic
drugs.  He was discharged with a Cr of 5.7, and not restarted on
his nephrotoxic meds.  He will be followed by renal as an
outpatient.  Furthermore, he was started on Tamsulosin for his
BPH.  His foley remained in place to allow [**5-26**] day bladder rest
before urology will try voiding trial as an outpatient in the
next few days.

#Hyperkalemia: He was found to have an elevated K 8 with
associated peaked T waves. Potassium levels dropped with
administration of kayexalate, insulin, and bicarbonate. Serial
EKGS also showed resolution of peaked T waves.

#DM II: Prior to this admission, he was only taking oral
hypoglycemics.  However, these were discontinued in light of his
ARF.  His blood sugars were managed on sliding scale insulin.
Since he required Humalog 5-7 units for the last 3 days of
hospitalization, he was sent home on Lantus 2units QHS with
lispro sliding scale coverage.  He will be followed by his PCP
in the next 2-3 days for follow-up  of this new diabetes
regimen.  He was also provided with an educational counseling
session regarding home insulin.  His oral hypoglycemics were
held, with the goal of transitioning back to agents after renal
approval and Cr normalization.

#BPH:  As above, his BPH contributed to urinary obstruction and
ARF.  DRE revealed symmetric enlargement of prostate.  Previous
biopsy was benign.  Was started on Tamsulosin this admission.
Urology will follow in clinic for void trial.

**CHRONIC ISSUES**
# Hypertension: He was found to be hypertensive to SBP 180s
during the admission as his ACE-I was held in light of his ARF.
After transfer to the floor, he was continued on his Amlodipine
5mg and Metoprolol succinate 100 daily.  Quinapril discontinued
indefinitely. Tamsulosin added for BPH.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable, continued his home statin.

**TRANSITIONAL ISSUES**
-Urology outpatient follow up: The patient will be called by
urology for an appointment this week.  Until then, foley will
remain in place and he will be visited by VNA for foley-related
care.
-Renal outpatient follow up to readdress kidney function and
possibility of restoring prior home meds: quinapril, metformin,
glipizide
-PCP follow up in the next couple days to follow up glucose
control on newly started insulin regimen and antihypertensive
regimen, and side effects to newly started Tamsulosin. Also
should repeat chem 7 to follow up K and Cr.
-Following meds should not be restarted until clearance from
renal:  quinipril, metformin, glipizide, NSAIDS, KCL

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Dr. [**Known lastname 174**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized
at [**Hospital1 69**]. You were hospitalized
because of changes in mental status, decreased urine output,
generalized weakness, and decreased functioning of your kidney.
Your kidney injury was most likely caused by an obstruction of
the bladder as a result of your large prostate. You were treated
with IV fluid resuscitation, that you tolerated well. A foley
catheter was also placed to bypass the bladder obstruction
caused by the enlarged prostate. The catheter will remain in
place until you follow up with the urology doctors. You will
receive more information about the details of this appointment
in the next couple of days. At the time of the appointment they
will provide you with further instructions concerning the
catheter and management of your large prostate. You were also
started on Tamsulosin, a medication that will help to reduce the
size of your prostate. Overall, your kidney function improved
greatly with these interventions.

Over the next several weeks it is very important that you stay
well hydrated and drink lots of fluids. If you notice an
increase in pain around the catheter, pain with urination,
change in urine color, or fever please contact your PCP or
return to the Emergency Room.

We have arranged several follow-up appointments for you
regarding your kidney function and enlarged prostate. These are
listed below.

We have made changes to your medications which are described
below.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo F with PMH schizoaffective disorder, CAD, HTN, DM,
restrictive lung disease, discoid lupus, and h/o CVA, who p/w 3d
h/o audio and visual hallucinations, leg pain, and SOB with
altered mental status.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#Alered Mental Status/Hallucinations: Given pt's history of
schizoaffective disorder and vascular dementia, initial
presentation was thought to be related to delirium vs.
progressive dementia or primary psychiatric condition. Initial
work-up for infectious and neurologic causes of delirium were
unrevealing. Urine analysis was unremarkable, chest xray showed
no infiltrate, blood cultures showed no growth. A head CT was
negative for an acute intracranial process. A head MRI was also
obtained to further evaluate for neurologic causes,and showed
only chronic changes and no new areas of ischemia.  An EEG was
obtained and was negative for epileptiform activity.  Over the
course of the work up described above, the pt slowly became more
withdrawn, which was different from her initial presentation in
which she was talkative and quite labile with religious ideosity
and frequent outburts of ""hallelujah"" and ""praise [**Doctor Last Name **].""  She
began to answer fewer questions, and began to appear somewhat
paranoid.  Psychiatry saw pt and recommended increasing
antipsychotic dosage from short acting seroquel 250mg po qhs, to
long-acting seroquel 300mg po qHS and adding on haldol 1mg po
BID.  This was done, and the next morning ([**2165-8-16**]) the patient
seemed withdrawn and stuporous.  She was awake but not
responsive to questions verbally, answering only with mild head
nodding. At this time, she was found to have a urinary tract
infection (see below), seroquel and haldol were discontinued and
the urinary tract infection was treated and her mental status
improved the following day, returning to a level similar to at
the time of admission.

On [**2165-8-20**], she appeared ill and was again withdrawn.  She was
febrile and diaphoretic.  Antibiotic coverage was broadened to
vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Pt then developed recurrent SVT to the
220s, relieved with carotid massage.  She appeared rigid and
diaphoretic.  She was transferred to the ICU for further
management.  In the unit psychiatry was consulted and atypical
presentation for neuroleptic malignant syndrome was considered.
She was treated with 2mg cogentin and ativan with mild
improvement in her mental status.  She was transferred back to
the general medicine floor, where her mental status continued to
wax and wane but never returned to her initial level of
interactiveness on admission.  She was responsive to some
questions, but refusing to answer others.  She did not
participate in physical exam commands.  She remained stable at
this point for several days.  Given the extensive negative work
up for delirium, this was considered to be her new baseline and
placement was found for skilled nursing facility for discharge
with permission from her health care proxy.  At time of
discharge, the patient remains AAO x2 (unchanged from before);
she is alert and talkative; still having delusions that her
family is outside waiting for her; gets agitated about wanting
to leave hospital and often refuses to sit or stay in bed.
Throughout hospitalization the patient was convinced that her
hallucinations and delusions were real.
.
# Urinary tract infection: [**2165-8-18**] patient was febrile and urine
analysis suggested urinary tract infection. She was treated with
ceftriaxone. Urine culture revealed
grew out presumptive Strep Bovis and E.coli grow out in her
urine.
.
# Supraventricular Tachycardia: Patient has a remote hx SVT, on
metoprolol for rate control. On [**2165-8-19**] she developed SVT to the
220s, which resolved spontaneously. Over the course of the
following day, she had 4 more episodes of SVT which responded to
carotid massage, she was never hypotensive. SHe was transferred
to the MICU for closer monitoring. Cardiology was consulted who
identified the rhythm as atrial tachycardia vs. AVNRT.  The
patient has been stable on Metoprolol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].

# Hypoxia: On admission, patient was hypoxic with 2LNC O2
requirement. There was no evidence of pulmomary edema or
consolidation. She was quickly weaned to room air. As part of a
work up, an ABG was performed which showed pO2 of 58, this
corrected to 92 with 2LNC. Patient was maintained on
supplemental oxygen without improvement in mental status. Given
significant a-A gradient, and persistent tachycardia, CTA was
performed and showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Patient
has a 20 pack year history and likely has baseline hypoxia with
sufficient compensation to maintain peripheral O2 saturation
>92%.  At time of discharge, the patient no longer has an oxygen
requirement, and is satting mid to high 90s on RA.

# Ankle pain: Initial laboratory analysis was remarkable for CK
in the 800s and an elevated ESR and CRP. Given her complaints of
left leg and ankle pain, orthopedic and rheumatologic causes
were considered, as well as PE.  Plain films of the left ankle
and hip were negative for fracture, but did show an area of
possible bone infarct in the distal tibia of unclear
significance.  Rheumatology was consulted who did not believe
the presentation was consistent with SLE, or gout. Amyloidosis
was also considered however SPEP and UPEP, total protein and
globulin levels were unremarkable. Statin-induced myopathy was
considered, and statin was held however CK had already begun to
trend down when the statin was stopped, making statin induced
myopathy unlikely.   A LE doppler was negative for DVT. MRI of
the leg MRI was done to evaluate for myositis, skeletal
vasculitis or other inflammatory myopathy, and diabetic
myonecrosis. It was negative for any muscle inflammation or
necrosis, and showed only edema in the subcutaneous tissues,
which had been noted on physical exam. Within the first few days
of her admission, ankle pain and erythemia resolved, etiology
remains unclear.
.
#Cog-wheel rigidity/masked facies/resting tremor - On admission
to the MICU, the patient developed acute presentation of
symptoms concerning for extrapyrimidal symptoms related to
antipsychotics.  Patient had received PRN doses of haldol, home
seroquel 250 mg.  However, all antipsychotics had been D/C'd 2
days prior to symptom onset.  Antipsychotics were held.  The
patient was given 1 mg cogentin x 2.  Psych was consulted, who
felt that her symptoms were consistent with EPS.  The patient
was started on Ativan 1mg q6 hrs PRN agitation.  Upon transfer
back to the general medicine floor, her rigidity had improved
and she continued to be treated with prn ativan for agitation,
though this made pt quite somnolent.  On [**2165-8-25**] she was
restarted on seroquel 50mg po BID prn agitation in an effort to
avoid sedation associated with benzos.  Then as per Psych
recommendation, the patient was restarted on low dose, 25 mg,
seroquel [**Hospital1 **].  All other PRN doses of seroquel and Ativan were
held.  The patient seems to be responding well to this regimen.
.
# Hypertension - pt had very difficult BP management while in
house.  She was still measuring in SBP 170s on several occasions
despite being on max dose of numerous BP meds, including
metoprolol, losartan, furosemide, and clonidine patch.  While in
house, hydralazine 10mg po TID was added to pt's regimen, and
metoprolol was further increased to 200mg po BID for management
of SVT.  On this regimen, her pressures ranged from SBP 140s -
150s, occassionally in the 170s.

# hypercholesterol:  Because of elevated CKs (peaked at 819),
the patient's Simvastatin was discontinued.  CK normalized to 92
by time of discharge.  She should have her CK rechecked as
outpatient and consider restarting simvastatin as outpatient.

INACTIVE ISSUES:

# CAD - Chronic.  Clopidogrel was continued on admission but
simvastatin was discontinued shortly after admission secondary
to elevated CK levels.

# restrictive lung disease: Chronic.  Patient was continued on
albuterol, ipratropium, tiotropium. Symbicort was replaced with
advair during admission due to formulary.  Pt is likely
compensated at a lower pO2 secondary to her lung disease.  She
was repeatedly hypoxic during admission without complaints of
shortness of breath.  Of note, pulse oximetry measured O2 sats
in mid-90s on several occasions in which ABG drawn at same time
showed hypoxia, so pulse ox is not reliable measure  of oxygen
status in this patient.

# DM - held glyburide, gave SSI while in house

# h/o candidal rash: miconazole powder

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# schizoaffective disorder: The patient was admitted on Seroquel
250 qhs and because of the possibility of NMS, the patient is
being discharged on Seroquel 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Her lorazepam was held
throughout hospital admission.

# please check the patient's CK as an outpatient, as she had
elevated CK levels as outpatient.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 90223**] is a 85-year-old male with CAD s/p PTCA LCx
([**2092**]), HLD, AAA, PE, PAD, COPD that was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for c. cath with complicated OSH course consisting of anemia
secondary to GIB, bilateral PE not on anticoagulation, and
NSTEMI with reduction of EF, and acute systolic heart failure.
Pt is transferred to the CCU prior to cardiac cath for ASA
desensitization protocol.
.
He was admitted on [**2109-1-10**] for SOB at [**Hospital3 1443**]
Hospital (contact number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 90224**]). [**Name2 (NI) **] oximetry was in
the low 80s at home responsive to home O2 via NC. He endorses
feeling cold type symptoms with coughing for quite a few weeks
but became more dyspneic with increasing cough and clear sputum
production. Chest CT showed new bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Venous US was negative for DVT. An IVF filter was placed on
[**1-10**] in setting of inability to anti-coagulate with anemia.
Admission labs were also notable for Hgb/Hct of 6.6/24.2 and
guaiac positive stool. He was treated for a presumed GIB. He was
transfused 3 units of pRBC. Endoscopy performed on [**1-11**] was
unremarkable. Colonoscopy was attempted on [**1-10**] but unable to
be performed secondary to stool in bowel. Colonoscopy
subsequently performed on [**1-17**] showed diverticulosis and
diminutive polyp x 1, which showed fragments of adenoma.
Labs were also significant for 3 sets of elevated troponins and
CPKs. ECHO on [**1-15**] showed EF 35 % (last EF on [**2108-3-6**] showed
EF 60 %). Stress test showed large area of ischemia extending
from the anterior wall and anterior apex of inferior wall. There
was evidence of prior small lateral wall infarction with
significantly depressed LVEF. His latest CXR showed mild CHF.
Additional studies included abdominal US showing AAA that is
stable compared to prior exam on [**2108-10-4**].
Hospital course also complicated by flash pulmonary edema on
[**2109-1-12**].
The patient was also treated for pneumonia although viral URI
was favored with fever 100.2 in setting of chronic prednisone
therapy although no infiltrate noted. He was treated with
moxifloxacin 400 mg PO qD for a 10-day course. CXR did not
suggest pneumonia.
.
Pt describes an ASA allergy consisting of redness on his face,
and rash diffusely many years ago.
.
On arrival to CCU, he was afebrile, with VS HR 76, BP 106/70, RR
20, 93% 3LNC, repeated at 98%. Pt denies chest pain, chest
pressure, or SOB. He says that he has felt overall weak since he
was admitted to the OSH, but that this has gotten better.
.
On review of systems, he endorses overall weakness as above. He
says that he has had black stools for the past year, but that
the doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'t been able to figure out why. He states that
he went to the OSH because he knew that his [**Name5 (PTitle) **] counts were
low. He denies fever or chills, but continues mild cough with
yellow sputum.
He also endorses previous leg cramping.
He denies any prior history of stroke, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, or red stools. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He is able to
walk 3 blocks with having to stop 2-3 times, which is unchanged
in the past year. He performs all of his ADL's and lives on his
own.

aneurysm (4.5 cm x 4 cm). Similar US seen on prior on [**2108-10-4**]

.
Colonoscopy ([**2109-1-17**]): 70 cm polyp
.
ETT:
Stress myoview [**7-1**]: normal scans. Mild inferior base
hypokinesis. EF 60 %.
.
CARDIAC CATH:  prior from [**2092**] not available
[**2109-1-21**] prelim: 1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant
system demonstrated three-vessel disease. The LMCA had a distal
80% stenosis. The LAD had a 50% mid stenosis and a 50% stenosis
of D1. The LCx had a 90% mid
stenosis. The RCA was occluded proximally and filled distally
via
left-to-right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial [**Year (4 digits) **]
pressures with SBP 106mmHg and DBP 56mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease and left main disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
NSTEMI:  Patient reported chest pain in setting of shortness of
breath, which appeared to be multifactorial. Denied any chest
pain but does endorsed shortness of breath which improved.
Complete cardiac biomarker set unavailable from outside records,
but appears had NSTEMI given biomarker elevation, EKG changes,
and decreased EF resulting in acute heart failure (60's to 30's
EF).  Nuclera stress at OSH showed large area of ischemia
extending from anterior wall and anterior apex of inferior wall
with evidence of prior small lateral wall infarction. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of cardiac catherization,
but first required aspirin desensitization as has documented
aspirin allergy.  Left cardiac ICU after aspirin
desensitization.  Cardiac catherization confirmed triple vessel
disease with RCA occlusion and LAD 80% occlusion.  Patient was
informed of necessity of coronary artery bypass, and declined
surgical intervention multiple times.  Based on patient wishes,
optimized medical management and defered surgical treatment.
* Medical management with Atorvastatin 80 mg qhs, Carvedilol
6.25 mg PO BID, ASA 325 mg PO qday, Captopril 12.5 mg TID.
* [**Month (only) 116**] want to switch short acting captopril to longer acting
lisinopril as an outpatient.

Acute systolic heart failure (last EF 35 %):
Patient developed acute systolic heart failure given EF decline
from 60 % ([**2108-3-6**]) to 35 %.  Most likely from ischemic event
as above. His dry weight in unknown, and he has experienced
weight loss in the past 3 months of about 20 lbs. At the OSH,
had flash pulmonary edema and an oxygen requirement which
resolved in house. Discharge weight steady at 140 lbs and
physical exam suggested euvolemia.
* Continued medical management with Captopril 12.5 mg PO TID,
Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID.  [**Month (only) 116**] want to change short acting
captopril to longer acting lisinopril as an outpatient.
* Deferred use of spironolactone as borderline hyperkalemia at
4.7.

Bilateral pulmonary embolisms, recurrent s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter
placement:  He has had second episode of pulmonary embolism in
past year. Uncertain as primary imaging report not available to
classify as segmental, subsegmental but overall did not appear
to cause hemodynamic instability at presentation. Etiology
unknown.  Given advanced age, 20-lb weight loss, and chronic
tobacco abuse, would suspect that neoplasm high on differential.
Other etiologies like immobility or recent surgery not present
to explain recurrence, and no family history of thrombosis.  Had
heparin gtt in house.  Discharged with 10 days worth of
enoxaparin injections with bridging therapy with coumadin to
treat PE.
* Follow up CBC/ Coag panel
* Discuss with patient duration of anticoagulation (life long?)
* Confirm age appropriate cancer screening on outpatient basis
per above
* consider thrombophilia work-up as outpatient
* IVC filter in place

Microcytic Anemia:  Has a history of anemia at baseline.
Admission to OSH Hct 24 and post-transfusion OSH Hct 33 status
post 3U pRBC.  At [**Hospital1 18**], Hct stable in the low to mid 30's.  [**Month (only) 116**]
have had marrow suppresion in setting of viral illness, as well
as GI [**Month (only) **] loss given history of adenomas. Hematology consult
at OSH impression was ACD vs. other process with consideration
for bone marrow biopsy as outpatient for unclear reasons. His
EPO level was elevated, which could suggest chronic hypoxemia in
setting of COPD vs. renal cell carcinoma vs. appropriate
response to anemia. Flow cytometry also not suggestive of
abnormal myeloid maturation or an increased blast population or
lymphoproliferative disorder. SPEP performed but results were
not available upon transfer.  No hypercalcemia or bony
involvement to suggest MM. He does have a history of prior GIB
in the stomach antrum. OSH Colonoscopy and EGD showed
diverticuli and polyp consistent with adenoma but no active
source of bleeding.  At [**Hospital1 18**], patient excxlaimed he has had a
20lbs weight loss, as well as night sweats a few times a week
for the last month.  Concern for malignancy, but discussion with
PCP is that he is aware of these symptoms and has performed age
appropriate screening for this patient.  Did have a history of
prostate cancer, but not complaints of bone pain at [**Hospital1 18**].
*  Need to follow-up final pathology of polyp from OSH
*  Check CBC on follow up


COPD :  Patient has long tobacco history and continues to smoke.
No evidence for active COPD exacerbation.  CXR demonstrated
diaphragmatic flattening consistent with COPD.  Discharged home
on albuterol and tiotropium.  Counseled on tobacco cessation but
patient not interested in quitting.  Additionally, at OSH was
treated with a 10-day course of avelox for low grade fever in
setting of prednisone usage with no infiltrate on CXR or CT.
* continued albuterol/tiotropium at home.
* F/u with PFT's prn

Abnormal ALT: Incidentally  patient's ALT elevated to 204 on
[**2109-1-10**] with downtrend to 51 on [**2109-1-20**]. Per OSH report
Abdominal US showed no liver pathology.  ALT on admission 204
now trended to 50s prior to discharge.
* Follow up LFT's as an outpateint

CHRONIC ISSUES
Temporal arteritis: No active issues. Continued prednisone 10mg
daily.

Weight loss
Broad differential for weight loss including depression given
prior history, poor access to food, underlying chronic illness,
and possible occult neoplasm.  Follow up per above.
*  Defer to outpatient work-up

Asymptomatic AAA:  AAA noted on OSH US significant for
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (4.5 cm x 4 cm) stable from
prior US dated [**2108-10-4**].
*  Defer to further outpatient management.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  Code status in house changed to DNR/DNI
confirmed with patient.  Should reconfirm with patient as an
outpatient and make sure power of attorney/living will paper
work is up to date.  Patient counseled on necessity of
continuing aspirin, and that if he discontinues use for even one
day may experience recurrence of allergic reaction given history
of allergy.  Patient understood necessity to take daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90226**],
  You originally presented to another hospital because of
shortness of breath.  There, you were found to have multiple
medical problems, including [**Name2 (NI) **] clots in your lungs as well as
evidence of a minor heart attack based on [**Name2 (NI) **] tests.
Additionally, you were found to have very low red [**Name2 (NI) **] cell
count.  You were given bags of [**Name2 (NI) **] to replete your low counts,
and placed on [**Name2 (NI) **] thinners in an attempt to treat the clots in
your lungs.  Your small heart attack affected the way your heart
could pump, and as a result the doctors at your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] hospital
suggested you come to [**Hospital1 **] for further
evaluation
  At [**Hospital1 **], you had a procedure called a cardiac catherization.
This is a procedure where a catheter is inserted in the large
vessel in your groin, and wired to the heart.  Dye was injected
to analyze the vessels in your heart, known as the coronary
arteries.  There evidence of severe coronary artery disease,
which causes the [**Hospital1 **] vessels to become blocked off.  This
finding was concering, as it increases your risk of a severe
heart attack.  Your doctors informed [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of this finding, and
suggested you have surgery known as a ""Triple Bypass"" surgery,
to circumvent the blocks in your coronary arteries.  However,
after you were told about the risks and benefits of having the
surgery, you decided this is not a procedure you would want
performed at this time.
  Because you declined to have the surgery, we have attempted to
medically optimize your medication regimen.  It is important to
continue to take your medications as prescribed, to help reduce
your risk of having another, larger, heart attack in the future.

  Additionally, you have been placed on medication to treat the
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] clots in your lungs.  The first medication is called
""Lovenox"" or ""Enoxaparin"".  It is injection you give yourself
twice a day.  The second drug is called ""Warfarin"" or
""Coumadin"".  It is a pill you will take to help keep your blodo
thin.  As warfarin takes some time to work, it is important you
take enoxaparin in the interim to help keep your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] thin
while warfarin starts to work in your body.  Please use the
enoxaparin injections for 10 days or as arranged by your PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is unclear why your red [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cell count was low when you
came to the hospital.  It is importnat you follow up with your
primary care doctor for further evaluation of this issue.

The following is your NEW LIST of medications.  Please
discontinue taking any medications that are not on this list,
and adhere to the medication dosing.

Your were ""desensitzed"" to Aspirin, this means that if you
continue to take it everyday you will not have an allergy to it.
 HOWEVER if you miss even a single dose please call your PCP to
discuss whether or not he wants you to take the next dose BEFORE
you take it.

Acetaminophen  325 mg Tablet 1 Tablet by mouth every 6 hours as
needed for pain.
Carvedilol  3.125 mg Tablet 2 Tablets by mouth [**Hospital1 **] 2 times a day
Warfarin  1 mg Tablet 3 Tablets by mouth once Daily at 4 PM.
Captopril  12.5 mg Tablet 1 Tablet by mouth three times a day.
Atorvastatin  80 mg Tablet 1 Tablet by mouth at night
Prednisone  5 mg Tablet 2 Tablet by mouth DAILY
Aspirin  325 mg Tablet 1 tablet by mouth daily

Tiotropium bromide  18 mcg Capsule, w/Inhalation Device
 1 Inhalation at bedtime.
Enoxaparin 60 mcg 1 injection 2x a day for 10 days
Nitroprusside 0.4 sublingual as needed for chest pain

It has been a pleasure taking care of you Mr. [**Known lastname 90226**]!

Followup Instructions:

Last Updated on [**2160-11-17**]

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HCV cirrhosis
complicated by HCC s/p lobe resection in [**2156**], who presented on
post-operative day 12 from craniotomy for a subdural hematoma
with fever, rash, and hypotension.
.
#. Hypotension and Fever: There was immediate concern for sepsis
on presentation to the ED, although no apparent source was
isolated and no significant fever was recorded in the hospital
(had 100.4 on admission to the ED). Sepsis workup was negative
including CXR, UA, Urine and Blood cultures. Final blood cutlure
results are still pending. Given recent craniotomy the
neurosurgery service was consulted and was not concerned for CNS
infection. A RUQ ultraound was performed that confirmed a
moderate amount of ascites and patency of the hepatic vessels,
but the abdomen was not tender and the suspicion for SBP was
low. Adrenal insuficiency was ruled out per cosyntropin test.
The patient did receive a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin in
the ED but none were continued in the ICU as the patient
remained afebrile and the ICU team's suspicion for infectious
process was low. The patient recieved a dose of IV steroids in
the ED and subsequently recieved a 3 day course of Prednisone
60mg. Dilantin was considered as a possible etiology for his
presentation, especially given the acute renal failure and
associated morbilliform rash, as a type IV drug reaction,
including DRESS, though no eosinophilia was noted on
differential. Adittionally patient had recently been started on
Keflex so anaphylactic shock due to allergy to cephalosporins is
another possibility. Both dilantin and Keflex were discontinued
and should be avoided in the future.  The patient remained
afebrile and normotensive during his ICU stay and the day after
admission was transferred to the oncology service. He remained
stable on the oncology floor and is now discharged back to rehab
facility.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure: Patient was admitted with a serum
creatinine of 1.2, up from a known baseline of 0.9 to 1 likely
pre-renal failure in the setting of hypotension. His Cr. on
discharge was 0.9. Renal functions and electrolytes should be
followed in the outpatient setting.
.
#. Elevated Liver Enzymes: 2/2o Hepatitis C Cirrhosis and
Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Patient failed Interferon and
Ribavirin in the past. Patient with known multifocal HCC
recurrence re-confirmed per RUQ ultrasound on this admission.
.
# Metabolic Acidosis: initially normochloremic with slightly
elevated AG, then hyperchloremic with normal anion gap. Likely
initially [**1-15**] to tissue hypoperfusion given the elevated lactate
on admission. Lactate was 3.1 on admission and decreased to 1.3.
Also contributed to by renal failure. Bicarbonate trending up on
discharge.
.
# Anemia: at baseline of 30-35. Had initial drop of Hct
secondary to rehydration and resolution of Hemmoconcentration,
Hct back to baseline at discharge.
.
#. Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives were held in the setting of
hypotension. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg was restarted on discharge.
Amlodipine continues to be held on discharge
.
#. Hypothyroid: Patient was continued on Levothyroxine without
event. Of note patient found to have increased palpable right
lower thyroid lobe. Further workup of this finding may be
considered in the out patient setting.
.
# Code status during this admission: Full

only from [**12-1**] through [**2192-12-3**].
.
50 yo generally healthy female, p/w N/V, fever, hypotension,
erythroderma and sepsis on admission requiring pressor support
and agressive hydration on presentation with ICU admission.
.
Sepsis: felt to be due to toxic shock associated with tampon
use.  Cervical cx. showed MSSA, all other cultures were
negative.  Pt. recieved Vancomycin, clindamycin, and zosyn
initially.  She improved hemodynamically and abx were tapered to
clindamycin po and she was transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **], at
which time wbc again rose with eosinophilia, this was changed to
cefalexin for one day.  As WBC continued to rise, all abx were
stopped.  At this time a morbilliform drug erruption was noted
truncally, and eosinophilia persisted.  These began to resolve
by d/c with discontinuation of all abx.  At time of d/c, pt. had
been afebrile for over 72 hours, all surveillance cx were
negative, and she was feeling well.

Her ICU course was complicated by mild acute renal failure that
improved with fluids, as well as mild pulmonary edema,
attributed to massive IV fluid resuscutation on presentation,
which resolved over time with auto diuresis.

Medications on Admission:
Tums only.

Discharge Medications:
Benadryl prn for itching.

History of Present Illness:
79 year old male with known coronary artery disease s/p cypher
stent to RCA in [**2098**] who has been complaining of chronic angina
with minimal exertion. In addition, notes difficulty breathing,
severe fatigue and chest pressure with light ADLs, such as
showering and picking up leaves. Despite maximal medical therapy
he is still complaining of recurrent angina and was referred for
elective catheterization. Catheterization revealed diffuse left
anterior descending narrowing with new narrowing at branching of
ostium which is not amenable to stenting without stenting over
circumflex. He presents today for surgical evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room
for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Please see operative
report for surgical details. He received cefazolin for
perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for post operative management.  That evening he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  On post-op day one he was
started on beta-blockers, diuretics and metformin. Later that
day he was transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy worked
with him on strength and mobility.  On post operative day two he
had episodes of nausea treated with antiemtics and then short
episode of confusion so his narcotics were stopped and he was
placed on ultram for pain management with good effect.  Due to
increased creatinine to 2.1 his lasix and metformin were
stopped, and lantus was increased for blood glucose management.
Over the next few days his creatinine peaked at 2.3 on [**6-6**] and
trended down to 1.7 at discharge.  He was resumed on lasix for
diuresiss with lower extremity edema.  Additionally he had
decreased hematocrit requiring transfusions, and restarted on
home iron.  Hematocrits were trended daily and they remained
stable.  Also his white blood cell count dropped but no fever
and differential was normal, he was pan cultured and to date
only grew on gram negative rods from sputum and was placed on
levaquin.  He continued to improve and was ready for discharge
to rehab on post operative day six to Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **]
with plan for follow up wound check next week for evaluation of
right leg.

Chief Complaint:
Elevated creatinine

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2195-11-2**]: Right heart catheterization
Dual chamber ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**] is a 54 year old gentleman with HTN, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0-2.2), CAD s/p CABG [**2186**], as well as systolic
and diastolic heart failure (EF had been as low as 20% but last
known to be 40%), who was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**]
Cardiology service from clinic on [**2195-10-16**] for worsening dyspnea
over 2 weeks. CHF exacerbation was in the setting of new
inferior HK and he was diuresed with hopes of pursuing RHC/LHC.
Hospital course was complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr>3.0), PIV-associated
MSSA bacteremia (did not want [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dc'ed on IV nafcillin x4
weeks). RHC was done and showed elevated filling pressures, so
he was transferred to the CCU for Milrinone to assist with Lasix
gtt. Due to infection, he was only on milrinone for a few hours.
He was transferred back to the floor and was diuresed well prior
to discharge. He followed up in clinic on [**2195-10-27**] and was found
to have creatinine elevated to 5.4 despite holding torsemide on
[**10-22**] (took it [**10-27**]). He was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for
management of his [**Last Name (un) **].
On interview this afternoon, he denies SOB at rest. He hasn't
been walking much, but doesn't feel ""crushing fatigue"" now like
he did before. He has been sitting to sleep, which he does think
is worse than when he was admitted. His itchiness continues, but
isn't worse than when in the hospital. He does endorse nausea,
diarrhea (8 loose stools a day) which he reports started with
the nafcillin. Denies fever, chills, abd pain. He reports ""I
don't do well with IVs. They always increase my creatinine
regardless of what it is."" He has been following the same diet
and eating light. He reports poor intake of fluid as he's trying
to avoid drinking a lot, ""much less than 1L a day."" His right
eye seems like it has a swollen eyelid today, but he hasn't
noticed. His wife reports that it always looks like this. No
headache.
Reports we weighed 219 today (recorded as 219.2), 215 yesterday,
211 on discharge.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. +Orthopnea, +PND

Imaging:
[**11-11**] Echo
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-11-9**],
left ventricular cavity size is smaller and overall ejection
fraction has increased.

[**2195-11-9**] Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-10-29**],
biventricular systolic function has decreased.

[**2195-11-2**] Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed severely elevated right
and left
sided filling pressures.  The mean RA pressure was severely
elevated at
18 mmHg, and the RVEDP was severely elevated at 22 mmHg.  There
was
severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of
80/33 mmHg
and a mean PA pressure of 49 mmHg.  The mean wedge pressure was
severely
elevated at 32 mmHg.  The cardiac output and index were reduced
at 4.3
L/min and 2.0 L/min/m2.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was
moderately elevated at 316 dyne-sec/cm5.
2. Ultrasound of the right internal juggular vein suggested
thrombus
which is possibly related to the patient's right sided PICC
line,
however subsequent imaging indicated no thrombus but RIJ very
medially
displaced.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
2. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Reduced cardiac output/index.
4. Moderately elevated PVR.
5. Possible thrombus in the right internal jugular vein which
was not
confirmed by subsequent studies which showed RIJ very medially
displaced.

[**2195-11-13**] CXR
Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer
defibrillator leads
are in standard positions.  Yesterday's mild pulmonary edema has
resolved.
There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal
widening.  Heart is
top normal size, unchanged over the long term.  Also unchanged
since at least
[**10-19**] are fractures of the two uppermost sternal wires,
which
developed sometime after [**2186-4-26**] when non-fusion of the
manubrium was
already evident radiographically.

[**11-12**] CXR
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**11-5**], there has been
placement of an
ICD device with the leads in the region of the right atrium and
apex of the
right ventricle.  Specifically, there is no evidence of
pneumothorax.  Little
change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.



Persistent separation of the upper sternal fragments therefore
does not
suggest infection, but it is an explanation for fracture of the
wires

[**10-28**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with systolic
and diastolic
heart failure.

PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to
[**2195-10-23**].

Heart size is enlarged in a globular manner, unchanged.
Mediastinum is
stable.  Multiple broken sternal wires are redemonstrated.

As compared to the prior study, there is interval improvement in
interstitial
pulmonary edema, currently mild.  There is also improvement in
more focal
right upper lobe opacity.  Prominence of pulmonary arteries is
demonstrated,
most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  No
appreciable pleural
effusion is seen.

[**2195-10-28**] RENAL U/S
IMPRESSION:  No hydronephrosis seen in either kidney.  Small
right renal
nonobstructing stone.

creatinine 5.4 in clinic. His renal function fluctuated, and he
was initially managed with 40mg [**Hospital1 **] torsemide. However, he did
not respond well and had worsening renal function. Accordingly,
he underwent R heart cath, which showed severely elevated right
and left sided filling pressures, severe pulmonary hypertension
and depressed CO/CI. He was admitted to the CCU for milrinone
drip and more aggressive diuresis.
On admission, urine studies suggested pre-renal cause of [**Last Name (un) **]
(FEurea 44% is indeterminate, FENa 0.86%).  Torsemide had been
held between hospital admissions. Nephrology was consulted and
recommended cefazolin to substitute for Nafcillin (though due to
the short time period, they did not believe [**Last Name (un) **] was consistent
with nafcillin-associated acute interstitial nephritis and urine
eosinophils were positive. Sarna lotion and hydroxyzine were
given for symptomatic relief of uremia-related pruritus. Pt's Cr
trended down to mid 3s, plateaued and then steadily rised. After
pt was switched from milrinone drip to dobutamine drip as well
as optimized afterload reduction with hydralazine and Isordil,
Cr consistently trended down. Upon discharge, Cr was 3.3.
.
#. Acute on chronic CHF: Due to continued weight gain and poor
response, he underwent a R heart cath [see above]. Pt's beta
blocker was restarted at a low dose and then later on
discontinued as pt was in decompensated HF and later on put on
dobutamine drip. Afterload reduction was successful while up
titrating hydralazine and Isordil. Upon discharge, pt's BP was
ranging 130-140. Heart failure team believed CHF is both related
to significant dyssynchrony and contractility issues, both most
likely related to ischemia. Pt was diuresed aggressively
throughout course initially with Lasix drip and then
transitioned to IV Lasix boluses with goal of [**3-12**].5L negative in
24h using 120mg boluses. Pt was transitioned to 100mg Torsemide
at discharge. Dyssynchrony component of HF was addressed with
attempting to place CRT-D. Unfortunately, coronary sinus could
not be accessed successfully and thus LV lead was not placed.
Contractility was addressed with dobutamine drip which pt was
discharged with. After starting dobutamine infusion, EF improved
from 20 to 30% on TTE. Pt will need to followup with EP in order
to access LV for appropriate resynchronization and will probably
have a cardiac catheterization to assess coronaries.
.
#. Peripheral IV-associated MSSA bacteremia:
- Changed nafcillin to cefazolin per ID recs; he underwent a [**Date Range **]
this admission, which did not show any valvular vegetations. As
a result, he underwent a shortened course of IV antibiotics (2
weeks), which ended on [**2195-11-2**]. Pt remained afebrile and stable
thereafter.
.
#. Loose stools
- Recent hospital stay could raise concern for C. diff (pt
nauseous, but no f/c). Per patient, he feels that loose stools
began w/ nafcillin. Either way, may contribute to pre-renal
cause of [**Last Name (un) **] (along with recent poor intake). Loose stools
resolved after stopping nafcillin. In addition, he was c. diff
negative.
.
.
#. CAD s/p CABG
Last cath in [**2191**] noted severe native 3VD with patent LIMA-LAD,

SVG-PDA, and Radial-OM1-OM2. TTE on prior showed new inferior
HK. He was continued on ASA, Pravastatin, and beta blocker
(Metoprolol changed to Carvedilol). In the future he needs L
heart catheterization in order to assess grafts/native vessels.
Pt was continued on ASA and statin. Carvedilol was ultimately
held given decompensated heart failure and pt put on dobutamine
infusion.
.
#. Neuropathic & venous stasis ulcers: Pt was seen by wound care
specialist during hospitalization. Ulcers appeared to heal more
optimally when LE edema decreased with aggressive diuresis. Pt
is to followup with PCP to continue DM management and may need
referral to vascular surgery if ulcers persist or worsen.
.
#. Diabetes mellitus: Stable on ISS, and discharged with Lantus
44u at bedtime with ISS.
.
# Iron deficiency anemia: Hct stable during last admission
30-33. Iron studies showed low level of iron and pt was given 5
days of ferric gluconate IV 125mg to replete iron deficit. Pt's
anemia was stable thereafter and discharged with hct of 28.1.

#Elevated INR: Pt's INR was elevated over 2 during hospital
course without anticoagulation. This was attributed to Vitamin K
deficiency secondary to antibiotic use, malnutrition and
malabsorption from congested bowels related to decompensated
CHF. DIC labs were not remarkable. Pt's elevated INR was
refractory to PO Vit K which supported hypothesis of congestion
in GI tract causing malabsorption issues. As pt's nutrition
improved and preload reduction, INR trended down to 1.4 at time
of discharge. Pt was followed by nutrition during stay and would
benefit from outpt nutrition management.
.
>> TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- follow up with EP regarding CRT lead placement into LV
- could benefit from ACEI once kidney function improves
- readdress restarting carvedilol when HF better controlled off
of dobutamine
- f/u with PCP regarding lower extremity wounds, medication
reconciliation and diabetes management
- would benefit from outpt nutritional support (fluid
restriction, diabetes)
- would benefit from cardiac cath once kidney function stable
and adequate to assess coronaries/ischemic disease related to
heart failure
- f/u with cardiology

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**],

You were first readmitted to [**Hospital1 1170**] for worsened kidney function as well as worsening
symptoms of heart failure.

You were then tranferred to the CCU because you required
medications to help your heart pump. You were first started on
milrinone with minimal improvement and were then started on
dobutamine.  You will go home on a continuous infusion of
dobutamine. It is very important for you to follow up closely
with your doctors and to take your medications as prescribed.

While you were here we tried to place a CRT device, however
there was difficulty placing one of the leads. You now have an
ICD. You will need a different procedure in the future to place
an additional lead on your heart for cardiac resynchronization.
You will also need a cardiac catheterization as an outpatient.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

It was a pleasure caring for you,
Your [**Hospital1 18**] doctors

Chief Complaint:
On admission: Mr [**Known lastname 79336**] states that he experienced two to three
months of abdominal discomfort, which grew in severity and
became more constant.  He had a simultaneous loss of appetite,
although he denies nausea or emesis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-10-12**] - s/p subtotal gastrectomy w/Bilroth II reconstruction,
transverse colectomy, feeding J tube placement


History of Present Illness:
On [**9-6**], the patient underwent a barium upper GI series.
This study demonstrated a large ulcerated mass associated with
the greater curve of the stomach in the distal portion.  On
[**9-8**], upper endoscopy was performed, with the finding of
a large ulcerated antral mass.  Upon biopsy, he has been
considered to have an invasive adenocarcinoma of the signet ring
type.

On [**9-13**], a CT scan of the torso was obtained.  He was
described as having a 4-mm right pulmonary lobe nodule.  There
was a 6-mm hypodense lesion in segment III of the liver.  A 7.5
cm mass was seen in association with the greater curve of the
stomach within the antrum.  There did appear to be some
stranding or nodularity in the greater omentum extending towards
the transverse colon, although there was no clear-cut
involvement of the transverse colon.  There did not appear to be
any significant retroperitoneal adenopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent the above procedure on [**10-12**].  He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the surgical floor,
with a foley catheter in place, NG tube in place, J tube to
gravity, PCA for pain control, his diet remained NPO, IVF for
hydration.  He received 3 doses of peri-operative antibiotics.

[**10-14**] - Tube feeds were started at 1/2 strength at 10cc/hour, NGT
discontinued

[**10-16**] - transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, oxygen
desaturations.  CTA performed showing no pulmonary embolism.
ECHO performed showing moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with global normal systolic function and mildly
dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.

[**10-17**] - respiratory status was stable. Had bilious emesis twice
and began burping. Tube feeds were held and pt was made NPO.

[**10-18**]- TPN started, NPO continued. UGI study showed ileus.

[**10-19**] - Transferred to the surgical floor, continued NPO, TPN,
NGT and foley catheter in place, TF at 20 cc/hr

[**10-20**] - transferred to the TSICU for continued respiratory
distress, transfused one unit RBC

[**10-21**] - Zosyn started for blood cultures positive for GNR,
central line removed

[**10-22**] - central line replaced, vancomycin started

[**10-23**] - CT guided drainage of right and left abdominal fluid
collections, drains left in place to gravity, flagyl added

[**10-24**] - cont TPN, TF at full strength at 60, started fluconazole
for yeast in left abdminal drain, transfused 2 units RBC

[**10-25**] - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] recommended possible re-exploration for a
presumed abscess.  He indicated to the family that there was no
evidence of any actual anastamotic dehischence from any of the
imaging studies. However, after extensive discussions, per the
patient and family requests, the patient was made comfort
measures only.  All antibiotics, tube feeds, and extraneous
means of support were removed.  The patient was transferred to
the surgical floor

DIAGNOSTICS
===========
PA/LAT CXR [**2131-10-1**]
AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were reviewed in
comparison to
[**2131-9-27**] as well as several prior studies dating back
to [**2131-7-23**].

As compared to the most recent prior radiograph from [**9-27**] and
[**2131-9-26**], there is significant improvement in
widespread parenchymal opacities with the current study
representing mild interstitial pulmonary edema. There is small
focal opacity in the left upper lung and left lower lobe which
might reflect partial resolution of the infectious process.
Hilar enlargement is bilateral, unchanged and might potentially
correspond to hilar lymphadenopathy, although pulmonary
enlargement might be another possibility.  There is no
appreciable pleural effusion, and there is no pneumothorax.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2131-9-24**] at 3:06:14 PM
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with
preserved global systolic function. Increased PCWP.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-8-17**],
the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed, right
ventricular cavity size is now dilated with free wall
hypokinesis and the estimated PA systolic pressure is much
higher. The severity of mitral regurgitation seems reduced.
These findings are suggestive of an interim acute pulmonary
process, e.g., pulmonary embolism or other acute pulmonary
process..
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56 year old woman with a history of cognitive delay, DMII,
recently diagnosed Crohn's disease on prednisone, probable
latent TB on INH, MRSA bacteremia from PICC on daptomycin (last
dose [**2131-9-24**]), who was admitted with hypoglycemia related to an
increase in her antihypoglycemic medications, with course
complicated by viral pneumonia and respiratory distress, now
resolved.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Hypoglycemia: Her presentation was related to aggressive
increase in oral hypoglycemics, after her hypoglycemic
medication dosages had been recently increased. She was treated
with D50 IV and her anti-hypoglycemics were held, glucose
normalized and her mental status returned to baseline. She was
maintained on a sliding scale insulin while in hospital.  She
was discharged on antihypoglycemic regimen from prior to
medication increases prior to admission. We recommend continued
monitoring of her finger glucose and gradually increase
glipizide or pioglitazone as needed.
.
# Viral Pneumonia: On [**2131-9-23**], the patient was triggered for
tachypnea and increased work of breathing. Her CXR was
concerning for HCAP as well as vascular congestion. Patient
received 20mg of IV lasix as well as nebs. Antibiotics broadened
to cefepime, but had persistent tachypnea, with CXR
demonstrating worsening bilateral infiltrates. Again received
nebs, Lasix 20mg IV (last dose at MN) with UOP 1L. She continued
to have worsening respiratory function and was transferred to
the MICU in obvious respiratory distress with accessory muscle
use and audible grunting. The decision was made to electively
intubate with anesthesia/respiratory at bedside. During
intubation patient paralyzed with succ with initial transient
hypotension to the 70s. Uncomplicated intubation performed and
patient sedated with propofol and fentanyl.  The cause of her
respiratory decompensation was probably multifactorial.  Her
antibiotics were broadened to linezolid/cefepime/levofloxacin
for possible multifocal pneumonia.  Given CXR evidence of
bilateral pulmonary edema, cardiogenic source was suspected and
she was diuresed.  TTE revealed normal left ventricular function
but right ventricular overload thought to be related to her
acute pneumonic process.  She underwent bronchoscopy on [**2131-9-24**]
which revealed +yeast, +PMN, and +rhinovirus, but no PCP or
bacteria.  Her rhinovirus may have contributed to her diffuse
inflammatory process.  PCP was [**Name Initial (PRE) **] concern due to her
unprophylaxed chronic steroid load of 30mg prednisone daily, and
indeed a beta glucan was positive, though this was felt to
represent her candidida from her lung.  Her linezolid and
cefepime were discontinued, and she was continued on
levofloxacin 8d course for possible bacterial suprainfection.
She was successfully extubated on [**9-26**] and transferred to the
medicine service on [**9-27**], where she completed levofloxacin
course, oxygen staturation remained in the upper 90's on room
air, she ambulated the [**Doctor Last Name **] without dyspnea. She was discharged
with dextromethorphan-guaifenesin as needed for cough.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Baseline creatinine 0.7, she was admitted
with creatinine 1.8 related to dehydration. Lisinopril was held,
she was treated with intervenous fluids and her creatinine
improved. Lisinopril was resumed.
.
# Rash: Diffuse livido reticularis appearing rash. She was seen
by dermatology and it was felt to be a reaction to her
vancomycin, and she was switched to daptomycin and started on
topical triamcinolone and hydrocortisone and the rash improved.
.
# Urinary Tract Infection: Her urine culture revealed
pan-sensitive E. coli and Klebsiella, which was treated with her
levofloxacin regimen she took for possible bacterial
suprainfection of her viral pneumonia.
.
# MRSA bacteremia: High-grade bacteremia believed to be [**1-31**] to
prior PICC now removed or endocarditis for which she was to
complete a 6 weeks of vancomycin on [**2131-9-24**]. She was switched
to daptomycin on [**9-17**] following the onset of a new rash that
was believed to be vancomycin-related, and completed daptomycin
course on [**9-24**].
.
# Leukocytosis: Throughout hospital course, WBC ranged 9-19, the
day prior to discharge, WBC had trended up to 15 from 13. She
was kept an additional night and a basic infectious workup was
performed. Chest xray looked improved, UA was negative, and
blood cultures showed no growth in 24 hours. The following
morning ([**2131-10-2**]), WBC trended to 13, she was clinically well
appearing and was discharged. Leukocyutosis is likely related to
prednisone.

# Crohns disease:  Increased prednisone to 40mg, and have since
resumed home 30mg dose.  Started on atovaquone for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
# TB treatment: Prior to admission, patient had indeterminant
QuantiFERON Gold test.Patient was continued on treatment for
LTBI with isoniazid/B6 Day #1 = [**2131-8-16**] for 9 months.  These
medicaitons should be discontinued after the 9 month course is
complete.
.
# Depression: Held home sertraline while on linezolid to prevent
serotonin syndrome. She became progressively anxious and
tearful. Resumed sertraline 250mg after confirming dose with
health care proxy and [**Name2 (NI) **] improved. No signs of serotonin
syndrome.
.
# Hepatitis B: Patient is Hep B surface antigen positive.
Continued home dose lamivudine 100 mg daily.
.
# Hypertension: Held lisinopril briefly due to [**Last Name (un) **]. Lisinopril
was resumed prior to discharge with adequate control.
.
# Asthma: Continued home fluticasone-salmeterol and started on
albuterol nebulizers.
.
# Glaucoma: Continued home Latanoprost
.
.

-titration of her diabetes regimen with careful monitoring of
her blood glucose level
-follow-up with hepatology

Chief Complaint:
generalized weakness, odynophagia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD

History of Present Illness:
85-year-old man with a history of recently diagnosed Kaposi's
sarcoma with visceral involvement, duodenal ulcer, ESRD not on
HD, HTN, HL, sCHF w/EF 40%, recent admission for GIB, is
transferred here from OSH for generalized weakness, confusion,
odynophagia.
.
Patient received his cycle 2 of paclitaxel on [**2108-12-5**] and has
been experiencing odynophagia from mucositis. For the past few
days he has felt ""not well"" at home, complaining of intermittent
shortness of breath, odynophagia and dysphagia. He presented to
[**Hospital6 10353**] on [**2108-12-10**]. There, he was found to have
pancytopenia. Initially CHF exacerbation was suspected given
clinical status and BNP of 65,987. However, chest CT without
contrast showed moderate pleural effusion with right lower lobe
atelectasis, but no evidence of pulmonary edema. Pneumonia was
suspected and patient was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
His home furosemide was held.
.
While at [**Hospital6 10353**], patient started to be delirious,
not knowing where he was, attempting to get out of bed
frequently, and at one point falling without head trauma, per

IMAGING:
# Chest CT (OSH) moderate R pleural effusion with RLL
atelectasis

# CXR [**12-14**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-12**],
there is layering of substantial right pleural effusion.
Probably smaller left pleural effusion shows layering as well.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestion. Underlying lungs are difficult to
evaluate, though there are probably at least atelectatic changes
at both bases.

# CXR [**12-12**]: IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of a pleural
effusion on the right with opacities that can likely be
attributed to atelectasis. Pneumonia cannot be completely
excluded, however. Follow-up radiographs may be helpful for
continued evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
85-year-old man with Kaposi's sarcoma with visceral involvement,
CHF, CKD presents with confusion, dyspnea, odynophagia,
generalized weakness.
.
#. Goals of Care: Patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia
to the high 80s from pulmonary edema and the plan to initiate
dialysis to remove fluid. The patient did receive one round of
dialysis before he and his family decided to change his goals of
care. While in the ICU, it was decided that the patient would be
made comfort measures only. The patient was started on a
Morphine drip, Benadryl for itching related uremia, and Haldol
for terminal delirium. The patient was subsequently transfered
to the oncology inpatient service.  Pt expired the following
night.
.
#. Dyspnea: Patient presented with some wheezing on exam,
bilateral crackles R>L. CT showed right-sided pleural effusion.
Intermittently tachypneic but with good O2 saturation. There is
no clear evidence of pneumonia. Patient does not have
significant coughs and the chest CT showed no clear infiltrate.
Antibiotics were discontinued on the oncology service. The
patient received nebs prn. Patient further received Furosemide
given concern for CHF on exam.  Pt had one round of dialysis but
did not resolve pt's tachypnea.
.
#. Confusion: Not at home but started being delirious at [**Hospital1 9487**]. Might be due to hospitalization-related delirium
in an elderly person, CHF exacerbation, pneumonia. Head bleed is
a possible cause given thrombocytopenia. Uremia (urea > 100)
from CKD was ultimately presumed to be the most likely cause.
.
#. HTN: Normotensive on admission. The patient was continued on
Hydralazine, Labetolol and Ranolazine initially, though these
meds were held for hypotension that may likely happen with
dialysis.
.
#. Odynophagia: Was presumed due to mucositis from recent
chemotherapy. Patient received pain control with narcotics and
was monitored closely for thrush. Pt was also started on Fluc
and Acyclovir.
.
#. CKD: Cr 4.0 at baseline but urea in the 130s from the usual
80s. The patient subsequently received one round of dialysis
before his goals of care were changed.
.
#. Kaposi's sarcoma with known visceral involvement: Patient was
pancytopenic from recent chemotherapy. Pt was started on
Neupogen and WBC responded appropriately.

Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with past medical history of CAD,
critical AS, hypertension, and radiation proctitis who presented
to the emergency department after sustaining an unwitnessed fall
this morning. The patient was moving from a commode to the bed
when she sustained a fall. The exact circumstances of this fall
are unclear. She does not remember experiencing any chest pain,
shortness of breath. The patient's son, who lives with her,
heard her fall and found her on the ground lying on her left
side. She was oriented and appropriate but complaining of severe
left arm pain.


In the ED initial vitals T 96.8, HR 72, BP 141/88, RR 16, O2 Sat
91% on RA. She went for radiographs, which revealed a left
femoral neck fracture, and then became hypotensive to 70s after
returning from radiology. She had some sensation of dizziness
and appeared pale but denied any localizing pain symptoms or
shortness of breath. She vomited once. After receving 3 L of IVF
her SBP's improved to the 90's but then drifted back down to the
70's. Serial ECG with baseline LVH but transient STE in V2. 1st
set of cardiac enzymes was negative. The patient endorsed mild
abdominal pain but denies chest pain, dyspnea, or presyncope.
She has had normal BM's. Vitals at time of signout T 96.5, AF
100-117, BP 80/45, RR 16, O2 97% on 2L.


Currently, she reports [**10-30**] left shoulder pain but denies any
chest pain, dyspnea, or other acute symptoms at this time.


Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, she endorses chronic
minimally productive cough as well as mild abdominal pain and
loose stools related to her radiation proctitis. She denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

STUDIES:
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA LEFT Study Date of
[**2146-1-31**] 10:06 AM
FINDINGS: Total of two views of the left shoulder were obtained.
There is an acute fracture involving the left humeral neck with
impaction and slight medial displacement of the distal fracture
fragment. No additional fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: Left humeral neck fracture.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2146-1-31**] 10:06 AM
FINDINGS: AP upright view of the chest is obtained. There is an
acute fracture involving the left humeral neck with a slightly
impacted appearance and medial displacement of the distal
fragment. Patient is rotated to left with a marked scoliotic
deformity, which limits evaluation through the chest, though
there is no definite evidence of lung consolidation, effusion,
or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
stable. Bones are demineralized.
IMPRESSION: Left humeral neck fracture. Otherwise, no acute
findings.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-2-1**] at 9:42:07 AM
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis. Moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic
function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-2-13**],
the calculated aortic valve area is smaller. The severity of
tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The previously seen small
secundum ASD is not well-visualized.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-2-2**] 7:47 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-1**], there is little
interval change on this somewhat limited study. Enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette persists with bibasilar atelectatic
change. There is suggestion of gas within a hiatal hernia. No
evidence of acute focal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for
CAD, critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a
fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
.
# Hypotension: Patient was found to be hypotensive in the ED
after coming back from radiology study.  The etiologies for her
hypotension were thought to be related to pain-medications and
critical AS.  Patient was given gental IV fluid boluses after
being admitted to CCU.  Patient's blood pressure continued to be
low, systolics in the 60s and 70s, during the rest of her
hospital stay.  Pressors were avoided given her severe AS.
Because of hypotension, she developed acute renal failure
rapidly (creatinine bumped from 0.9 to 2.9 in 2 days).  Patient
declined hemodialysis, also denied AVR or valvuloplasty, so
after extensive discussions with patient's HCP (her son, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 10166**]), decision was made to make patient comfort measures only.
She expired on day 3 of her hospital stay from acute renal
failure and electrolyte abnormalities.
.
# Critical AS: The patient had a previous valve area of 0.7cm2.
She underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).  She declined AVR or
valvuloplasty.  She expired on [**2146-2-2**] in the setting of
critical AS, hypotension and acute renal failure.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from labs
but appeared to be around 0.6-0.7.  Patient's creatinine was 0.9
on admission, likely prerenal in the context of appearing dry.
No recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins, and no symptoms of
UTI with benign UA.  Patient was hypotensive during her hospital
stay.  As a result, her kidney function deteriorated rapidly.
Her creatinine bumped to 2.9 on day 3.  Patient declined
hemodialysis, so she was made comfort measures only after all
medical options to keep her alive failed.  On the morning of her
expiration, her K was 5.4, and she was not producing urine.  She
passed at 1900 that day.  It is therefore very likely that she
died of hyperkalemia.  On telemetry, she went into brief VT
followed by asystole minutes before her demise.
.
# Fall: Etiology of fall was unclear. The most concerning
possibility was that patient's AS led to syncope due to
hypoperfusion. Unfortunately, as the fall was unwitnessed and
the patient did not remember what happened this was impossible
to prove. Patient underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).  Therefore, it was
certainly very likely that AS played a role in the fall.
.
# Humeral Fracture: Patient was seen by Orthopedics in the ED.
Ortho decided to manage conservatively with sling and analgesia.
Pain control was achieved with tylenol around the clock,
lidocaine patch, and low dose dilaudid with a goal to minimize
effect on blood pressure.  Patient's pain was well-controlled on
the above regimen.
.
# Rhythm: Patient was in atrial fibrillation, and not
anticoagulated. She was not on aspirin or coumadin because of a
previous GI bleed.  Metoprolol was held given her hypotension.
Patient was observed on telemetry during her hospital stay in
CCU.  She went into VT followed by asystole minutes before she
expired, likely secondary to hyperkalemia in the setting of
acute renal failure.
.
# Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology, though rapid increase and lack
of fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggested possibly
leukemoid reaction in the context of fracture and injury.
Cultures were negative, including blood cx, urine cx and c.diff.
 Patient was not started on antibiotics since she had no sign of
infection.
.
# Anemia: Patient had history of normocytic anemia, baseline
around 29-20.  Her hct was 43.6 on admission, likely
hemoconcentrated.  Hct decreased to her baseline of 29 during
the next two days.  She had no signs of active bleeding.
.
# CAD: Patient reported history of CAD, but with minimal details
and there are no caths in our system. Patient was not on ASA or
statin (lipids normal). Patient had some cardiac enzyme leaks
during her hospital stay, likely in the setting of hypotension
and decreased blood supply to coronaries.
.
# PPx: Patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.
.
# FEN: Patient was given cardiac healthy diet during this
hospital stay.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI (discussed with patient and son-HCP)

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo lady with a history of COPD, CHF,
alzheimer's and expressive aphasia, who presented from her
nursing home to the ED in respiratory distress on [**2152-7-26**] about
1.5 hours after eating her lunch. She has had an episode of
aspiration about one year ago as well as urosepsis a few months
ago. In the ED, her vitals were T 98.9F, HR 130, BP 158/66, RR
40 and O2 sat of 91% on RL. A chest xray taken showed widespread
coarse reticular opacities but no signs of consolidation. She
was given solumedrol given her history of COPD. She was also
started on IV Vancomycine and Aztreonam (due to a PCN allergy)
as well as metronidazole. She was also given 1L Normal Saline
for alactate of 4.7.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia. She was then
admitted to the MICU for further care.

In the MICU, her Aztreonam was dc'ed, and she was started on
cefepime instead. She was also started on an insulin sliding
scale. Her lactate returned to 1.3, and her cre and WBC trended
down as well (WBC 26). Her IV fluids were tricky since any flow
>75cc/hr led to hypertension with sbp int he 170's. However, she
was able to tolerate small boluses of fluids. A straight cath
performed also showed purulent liquid, though her urine cultures
from [**2152-7-25**] were negative. After a few hours in the MICU, she
was transferred to the floor.

CXR ([**7-28**]):

FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**7-25**], the diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications are less prominent.  Some of
this may reflect the PA rather than AP frontal view.  Blunting
of the costophrenic angles is consistent with bilateral pleural
effusions with some compressive atelectasis at the bases.

CXR ([**7-25**]):
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
mild increase in the diameter of the pulmonary vessels,
potentially indicative of mild fluid overload.  In addition, the
atelectasis at the left lung base has increased in extent and
there is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially
caused by a small left pleural effusion.  No cardiomegaly.
Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax.

EKG: [**2152-6-30**]:
Sinus rhythm and occasional atrial ectopy. Low limb lead
voltage. Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2152-7-26**] the axis is more rightward, atrial ectopy has
appeared. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

and aspiration who presented from her nursing home in acute
respiratory distress after eating lunch.

SIRS 4 PROGRESS NOTE [**2152-7-29**]
Assessment and Plan:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with a history of COPD, alzheimer's dementia,
and aspiration who presented from her nursing home in acute
respiratory distress after eating lunch.

# Respiratory Distress: Possibly secondary to aspiration, which
is consistent with the presentation 1.5 hours after lunch.
Initial CXR showed multiple reticular opacities but no
consolidations. Repeat CXR showed less prominant bilateral
opacifications, though there is possible bilateral pleural
effusions with some compressed atelectasis at the bases.
Initially on Vancomycin and Cefepime, switched to IV Ceftriaxone
to treat UTI since pna was unlikely. IVF was at 40cc/ml for the
last 3 days of her hospitalization. PO trial of thick liquids
started on [**2152-7-29**], which pt tolerated well. Lungs sounded a lot
clearer with residual right base crackles. Pt breathing
comfortably at 94% O2 sat on room air.

# Abnormal EKG - Admission EKG read yesterday by Cardiology, who
was concerned about possible acute event. However, EKG compared
with one in [**2142**], which also showed similar changes. Troponins
elevated at 0.06 x 2 but did not trend up, likely from transient
ischemia due to increased cardiac demand [**12-30**] infection. No signs
of acute cardiac event. Medical management with beta blocker,
asa discussed with family, who declined due to allergy to asa
and desire for minimal medication.  Patient did tolerate
beta-blocker (metoprolol 6.25mg) for one dose and seemed to perk
up afterwards, but given difficulty in administration here in
the hospital (took patient an hour to swallow pill) did not
continue.  Can be considered as outpatient.

# Sepsis: Resolved. Likely secondary to a UTI. Grossly positive
UA though urine culture was negative, PMH of recurrent UTIs,
recent admission to [**Hospital3 **] with urosepsis from
multi-drug resistant E.coli, necessitating treatment with
primaxin. Straight cath in MICU drained purulent material. Urine
culture showed no growth, but per pt's son, pt had already
received IV abx at that time. Plan to complete 7 day course of
ceftriaxone on [**2152-8-3**].

# Volume status: Tenuous. Per MICU and patient's son, patient
become hypotensive with no fluids but rapidly becomes
hypertensive (up to sbp of 170's)if fluids given too fast. At
present appears to respond well to slow small fluid boluses, at
a rate of 75-100cc/hr. Was continued on IVF at 40cc/hr per pts
son as an amount that she has tolerated well in the past.

# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Started on ISS on [**2152-7-26**], but NPO,
became hypoglycemic and ISS was downtitrated in the MICU.
Changed to regular insulin sliding. Glucose stable. Januvia held
while inpatient and continued to use reduced dose insulin
slididng scale.  Can restart Januvia on d/c.

# Sacral pressure ulcer: Wound care recs - Plan:  Pressure
redistribution measures, turn and reposition every 1-2 hrs off
back. Limit sit time to 1 hr at time and sit on a pressure
redist cushion.
Protect intact skin midback and coccyx area with Critic aid
Clear
daily and prn or every 3rd cleansing.

# Pruritus: pt developed agitated pruritus starting about 15
minutes after her cefepime infusion two days ago. Resolved on
switch to ceftriaxone.

# Hypokalemia: Resolved after repletion.

#General - PT discontinued because it was too rigorous. Followed
their initial recs of OOBx3 per day.
.
Transitional Issues
- Encourage PO intake
- Completion of ceftriaxone 1gm q24 hrs - last dose on [**2152-8-3**]
- Consideration of maintenance fluids
- Consider beta blocker (per pt's family, pt seemed to perk up
after single dose of metoprolol 6.25mg PO. Systolic BP decreased
to 120's, HR in 70's, Respiration rate to 16-20).

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs [**Known lastname **], you were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to concern for a
respiratory infection. You were found to have a urine infection.
 A chest xray showed no evidence of a pneumonia, so we think its
more likely that a urinary infection was causing your worsening
status. You were given antibiotics and for a few days we didn't
give you any food by mouth and gave it instead through your IV.
When you had improved and were eating small amounts of food
again, you were discharged back to [**Hospital3 **].

You will need 2 more days of ceftriaxone for your urinary
infection

Followup Instructions:
You will be discharged back to [**Hospital3 **] and should continue
care under your prior outpatient doctors.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================

[**2123-4-8**] HIDA SCAN:
IMPRESSION: Normal hepatobiliary scan. No evidence of
cholecystitis.

[**2123-4-7**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Mild global atrophy with mild chronic microvascular ischemic
disease.

[**2123-4-7**] CT TORSO WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilation of the gallbladder is nonspecific without
accompanying secondary signs of cholecystitis.
2. No definitive acute infectious process identified.
3. Large left hemidiaphragmatic defect without definitive
evidence of bowel obstruction or strangulation. Equivocal fat
stranding is seen here and the contrast column has not cleared
this point-delayed plain film might be useful
4. Marked demineralization accompanied by severe degenerative
changes of the spine and hips. Multiple age indeterminate
thoracic compression fractures.

[**2123-4-6**] CHEST (PA & LAT):
IMPRESSION: Large retrocardiac left mid-to-lower hemithorax
opacity with
areas of lucency with appearance of bowel and possibly stomach,
likely related to large hernia possibly containing bowel, not
well evaluated on this study, no priors for comparison. Minimal
right base atelectasis.

[**2123-4-6**] RUQ U/S:
IMPRESSION: Distended gallbladder without evidence of stones.
There is mild prominence of the extra- and intra-hepatic biliary
ducts with the common bile duct measuring up to 10 mm. However,
the patient has an equivocal [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign post-medication as
demonstrated by the attending radiologist. Acalculous
cholecystitis can not be excluded in the appropriate clinical
setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F with a history of CHF, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis who presents
with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain since Sunday. Imaging
at OSH significant for likely cholecystitis. Deemed poor
surgical candidate so transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of
percutaneous drainage by IR.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:

# CHOLECYSTITIS: On arrival patient was with high-grade
leukocytosis, fever, and significant abdominal pain and nausea.
She was admitted to the MICU for concern for evolving sepsis.
She underwent RUQ U/S here with findings that could be
consistent with acalculous cholecystitis. She was evaluated in
the ED by general surgery who felt she was not an ideal
operative candidate and suggested HIDA scan and evaluation by IR
for percutaneous cholecystostomy. EGD also evaluated her but
deferred to IR given the lack of obstructive findings on her
LFT's. CT torso and HIDA scan were negative for cholecystitis
but did demonstrate dilated gall bladder. CT torso also
demonstrated known large diaphragmatic hernia with stomach and
bowel in the left chest with mild stranding and old PO contrast
from OSH possibly c/w recent inflammation of the intrathoracic
bowel. IR thus felt there would be little benefit from
intervention. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn, became
abdominal pain free, afebrile, with a downtrending white count
and was called out to the floor for further management. The
patient did well on the floor. Her vancomycin was discontinued.
She remained on zosyn and completed a 7-day course in house.
Symptoms resolved at the time of discharge.

# TRANSIENT SOMNOLENCE: Patient has multiple late morning
episodes of transient somnolence with normal finger sticks,
normal ABG's, and no clear seizure activity. She had a CT head
which was negative for acute process. This was thought to be the
result of oversedation from meds (IV morphine, klonopin PRN, PM
amitryptiline, and antiemetics). Her level of alertness
spontaneously resolved following these episodes.

# DIARRHEA - On the floor the patient had a number of episodes
of diarrhea. A C. Diff was negative. She was maintained on IVF.
Her vancomycin was stopped as above. The patient's bowel regimen
was stopped. The diarrhea improved.  Bowel regimen may be
resumed as outpatient PRN.

# DEPRESSION: The patient endorsed acute on chronic decrease in
appetite long with insomnia and anhedonia.  This was felt to  be
due to worsening depression.  Nutrition evaluated her and felt
that she need maximal supplementation of her diet.  The
psychiatry team evaluated her while she was in the hospital and
started mirtazapine 7.5 mg QPM (1 hour before meals). On the
last evening of her admission she was able to sleep.  Her
depression should be monitored while on this medication for
signs of improvement.  She warrants ongoing evaluation of her
symptoms and medications.  At the moment she appears well
nourished, but if her diet and appetite do not improve with
treatment of her depression then nutrition felt she might
require tube feeds and evaluation for PEG tube.  This was
briefly discussed with her son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 110281**].  Given that she is
still recovering from an acute abdominal insult, it was felt
that further evaluation could take place on an outpatient basis.


# URINARY RETENTION: The patient was noted to have problems with
urinary retention after having her Foley pulled.  IF she does
not produce urine she will need to be bladder scanned and
possibly straight cathed if scanned for > 500.  At the time of
discharge she was incontinent of urine.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
# COPD: Treated for exacerbation with rapid steroid taper in
early [**Month (only) 547**]. No active wheezing on exam. Continued on nebs
in-house.

# CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF: LVEF >75%. On home furosemide and
digoxin which were initially held. Pt's digoxin level non-toxic
on admission.  Given poor PO intake, her lasix was held at the
time of discharge.  It can be resumed at her nursing home once
deemed appropriate after assessment of her volume status by a
physician.

# GLAUCOMA: Stable. Continued on Lumigan 0.3% OU QHS

# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY/RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME: Chronic issue for
her. Her home klonopin was dose-reduced PRN but she was
continued on her home amitryptiline and citalopram.

# POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA: On chronic prednisone. No evidence of
adrenal insufficiency. Continued on prednisone 5mg PO daily
in-house as well as calcium and vitamin D.

# HTN: Restarted on metoprolol after infectious process
resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old female with history of cervical cancer and many
abdominal surgeries s/p colostomy and [**Hospital 80011**] transferred from
OSH for further management of suspected small bowel obstruction.
Admitted to Medical ICU.
.
# Abdominal pain, nausea ?????? Surgery involved. At this time
diagnosis of SBO suspected, although surgeons are waiting to see
CT abdomen from OSH to solidify diagnosis. Supported by large
number of abdominal surgeries patient has had (-> risk for
adhesions). Also with mildly elevated transaminases and alk
phos. Differential also includes gastroenteritis, cholecystitis,
cholangitis. Mildly febrile and with leukocytosis. Given history
of possibile pneumobilia on CT at OSH hospital, ddx also
includes biliary-enteric anastomosis or fistula. ?history of
hepatitis.
- intially NPO
- NGT to low continuous suction, removed [**9-20**] and started on
sips
- Hydrate with IVF until adequate PO
- Pain control (minimize narcotics)
.
#Pneumothorax: Pt had PTX most likely [**1-3**] line placement at OSH.
 Chest-tube was placed and almost complete resolution of PTX.
-chest tube to suction until [**9-20**] - placed to waterseal
-chest tube removed [**9-21**] without complication
.
# Respiratory failure ?????? Pt previously intubated for hypercarbic
respiratory failure. Likely secondary to narcotics. Pt
successfully extubated and on 4L NC on [**9-18**]
.
# [**Name (NI) 3674**] pt with Hct of 33.9 down from 38.1.  Likely dilutional
from fluids and blood loss from chest tube placment.
.
# Acute renal failure ?????? Creatinine 0.7 today, much improved from
admission. History of vomiting and poor PO intake, this may be
secondary to dehydration. Urine output  >30 cc per hour.
- Continue to hydrate
- Maintain UOP >30cc/hr
.
# UTI - UA with positive nitrite, trace ketones, >50 WBCs, and
many bacteria. Given one dose of ciprofloxacin in ED. Given that
patient has ileostomy, she will likely always have a 'dirty' UA.

- Hold off on treating at this time as may just be a contaminant
- Follow urine culture
.
Patient was successfully extubated in ICU. Continued with
confusion. Restraints applied. Remained NPO with IVF. Mental
status cleared slowly. Transferred to Stone 5 for further
management on [**9-20**].
.
[**9-20**] -Pt pulled NGT out due to agitation r/t naroctic
medications. Maintained in 2 point restraints overnight. Mental
status much improved in morning. Ostomy with gas but no stool.
KUB repeated-resolving ileus.
.
[**9-21**] -Abdomen slightly distened. Started on clear liquids.
Tolerating well. No N/V. Right chest tube removed at bedside,
uncomplicated. CXR completed 2 hours after, lungs clear, no
evidence of pneumothorax. Ostomy RN contact[**Name (NI) **] to assist with
management of leaking ostomy and urostomy. Assisted OOB with
nursing. Ambulated without assist. Lives independently with
boyfriend. Diet advanced to regular food in evening. Tolerated
well.
.
[**9-22**] -Continues to tolerate Regular food. Ostomy and Urostomy
putting out adequate amounts of urine/stool. Pain well
controlled with oral medication. Abdominal pain decreased.
Ostomy continues to leak even with efforts of Ostomy RN due to
patient's anatomy. Plan for discharge home today with VNA for
continued management of Ostomy appliance and skin assessment.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old male with known coronary disease, status
post coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in [**2137**]. He is an
active smoker and has severe COPD confirmed by PFT and recent CT
scan. On a CT scan in [**2151-8-14**], there was an incidental
finding of a focal aneurysmal outpouching of his ascending aorta
along with a left lingula mass. Further review by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
thought it looked like a penetrating atherosclerotic plaque that
had ulcerated and that it was only covered by a very thin aortic
wall and thus was at risk for rupture. He underwent a stent
graft repair of this in [**2151-11-14**]. Follow-up CT scan has
shown an endoleak with expanding pseudoaneurysm into his aortic
arch. Given his endoleak and expanding psuedoaneurysm, it has
been decided to return to the operating room for repair.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent redo sternotomy repair of
pseudoaneurysm involving the distal ascending aorta with bovine
pericardial patch using deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest. For surgical details, please see
the operative note. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. He was transfused
with PRBC's to maintain a hematocrit near 30%. He remained in
the CVICU for aggressive bronchial hygiene and tenuous pulmonary
status with baseline COPD. He maintained stable hemodynamics and
was transferred to the step down unit on postoperative day two.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation of his strength
and mobility. He became acutely confused on POD#3. This
confusion was felt to be related to Ativan which was discontined
and within 24-48 hrs his confusion had resolved. Also on POD#3
serous sternal drainage was noted on his sternal wound without
any erythema or sternal click. He was placed on emperic
antibiotic coverage. He remained afebrile with stable white
blood counts and without any sign of infection. He remained in a
normal sinus rhythm.  He had an pleural air leak
postoperatively, however chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed without incident. He remained in the hospital for
extended period due to continued drainage and on post-operative
day eight this drainage had resolved and he was discharged with
ten days of Keflex to Newbridge on the [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation

Allergies:
Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripherally insterted central catheter
Nasogastric tube


History of Present Illness:
85 M with h/o CVA s/p recent CEA, DM2, CKD and HTN who presents
from [**Hospital1 1501**] with respiratory distress. Although it is not clear
from discharge summary, recent hospitalization complicated by
SICU stay for PNA vs CHF. Unclear if patient was reintubated but
was started on levofloxacin and diamox. Discharged ([**11-28**]) to
complete 2 week course of ciprofloxacin.
.
ROS: denies shortness of breath, fevers, chest pain. reports
only feeling worn and not well. + achy, tired, malaise. Denies
DOE (walks >1 block prior to previous admission with cane), PND.
Stable 2 pillow orthopnea. No ankle edema.
.
ED Course:
In ED, afebrile but briefly hypotension and responded to small
fluid bolus. CXR showed likely PNA and the patient was given a
dose of vanc/CTx. Requiring non-rebreather to maintain
oxygenation. Prior to coming up to the ICU, the patient went
into a fib with RVR (HR to 140s). Started on dilt drip.
.
MICU Course:
Treated for HAP with vanc/levo/flagyl. Respiratory status
improved with decreasing O2 requirement and afebrile. Weaned off
dilt gtt, AFib remained well-controlled on PO beta blocker and
spontaneously converted to sinus. One episode OB+ 'black' stool
but stable Hct and hemodynamics stable.
.
[**Hospital1 **] Course:
He was called out to the floor on [**12-4**]. On the floor he appeared
dyspneic and was diuresed for pulmonary edema, but dyspnea not
completely resolved. He had negative LENIs and V/Q scan with
intermediate probability PE. He also continued to tell the team
that ""I want to die"". SW was consulted and ritalin was started.
Pt was not taking in POs and creatinine also started trending up
again.  [**2131-12-12**] pt was found to have BP 72/40 and decreased UOP.
He was given a 500 cc bouls and Bps initially trended up to
82/50 and then down to 70/40. He then received an additonal 1 L
fluid bolus and was transferred to the ICU.
.
MICU Course:
He received 7 liters of IVF with improvement of his blood
pressure and subsequent improvement in his mental status.
Psychiatry and neurology were consulted; his perseveration on ""I
want to die. Hurry up."" did not seem consistent with a diagnosis
of depression, but his behavior did raise concern of frontal
release . Neurology Celexa was stopped as it has been reported
to cause hypotension and is without immediate benefit to the
patient, and at the recommendation of psychiatry, ritalin was
stopped as well.

EKG: sinus, 100bpm, LAD, freq PACs, IVCD similar to prior
.
CXR, portable ([**12-1**])- Large hiatal hernia. Increasing air space
opacities within the left lung and right lower lung zone. There
is no pneumothorax. There are no pleural effusions.
.
TTE ([**12-4**])- The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**12-6**])- The right PICC line tip terminates in the SVC.  The
large hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  There is worsening
of bilateral infiltrates, suggesting increased degree of
pulmonary edema and also of the underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded, especially in the right lower lobe and left upper
lobe. Bilateral pleural effusion is small-to-moderate.
.
Bilateral LE U/S ([**12-7**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
either lower extremity.
.
V/Q scan ([**12-7**]):
INTERPRETATION:  Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol
in 8 views demonstrate central  deposition of the
radiopharmaceutical, due to the turbulent flow. There are
widespread ventilatory abnormalities in RML, RLL, LUL, LLL,
predominantly at lung bases. Perfusion images in the same 8
views show similar pattern of perfusion abnormaliies, also most
pronounced at the bases. Chest x-ray shows diffuse bilateral
infiltrates with similar distribution pattern.
IMPRESSION: Matched perfusion and chest X-ray findings.
Intermediate likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.
.
Chest CT, non-contrast ([**12-10**]):
1.  Intrathoracic stomach.
2.  Multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration.  Small
bilateral pleural
effusions and subcarinal mediastinal adenopathy, presumably
reactive.
3.  Calcific cholelithiasis.  No evidence of cholecystitis.
.
Head CT, non-contrast ([**12-12**]):
FINDINGS:  The posterior fossa is not well seen on today's
examination
secondary to patient motion artifact.  There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage. Old areas of hypodensity seen within
the left external capsule are unchanged compared to [**2131-11-24**],
consistent with chronic lacunar infarction.  A lacunar infarct
within the right caudate nucleus is also unchanged in
appearance. There is no evidence of intracranial mass lesion,
hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.  The
density values of the brain parenchyma are within normal limits.
 The surrounding soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses appear clear.
IMPRESSION:    No new areas of acute infarction identified.  The
previously reported tiny left parafalcine subdural hematoma seen
on MRI is not seen on today's examination, likely secondary to
interval resorption.
.
Brain, Head, Neck MRI/MRA ([**12-15**]):
FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI:
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of
[**2131-11-23**].  The
previously seen subtle increased signal in the right parafalcine
region in the frontal lobe on diffusion images is again
visualized and appears to be due to T2 shine through.  Mild
periventricular changes of small vessel disease are seen.  There
is no evidence of midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus
seen.  There is moderate brain atrophy seen.  On diffusion
images no evidence of acute infarct is noted.  The previously
identified interhemispheric parafalcine subdural hematoma has
also resolved since the previous MRI examination with subtle
changes remaining in this region.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute infarct or new finding since
the previous MRI study.  Resolution of previously noted subdural
hematoma.  No mass effect or hydrocephalus.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
MRA demonstrates a normal flow signal in the anterior
circulation.  The A1
segment of the left anterior cerebral artery is hypoplastic but
both A2
segments are well visualized.  There is mild irregularity of the
flow signal seen in the basilar artery which could indicate mild
atherosclerotic disease. The distal right vertebral artery is
not visualized which appears to be secondary to the artery
ending in posterior inferior cerebellar artery, a normal
variation.
IMPRESSION:  Mild atherosclerotic disease otherwise unremarkable
study.
MRA OF THE NECK:
The 3D time-of-flight MRA of the neck is limited by motion.  No
evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
IMPRESSION:  Somewhat motion-limited normal MRA of the neck.
.
Right upper extremity U/S ([**12-16**]): Occlusive thrombus in the
right basilic vein surrounding indwelling PICC line.  No deep
venous thrombus in the right upper extremity is identified.
.
EEG ([**12-18**]):
FINDINGS:
BACKGROUND: A 9 Hz disorganized posterior predominant rhythm was
noted
in the waking state, which attenuated with eye opening.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to mental status.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from the waking to drowsy states,
but did
not attain stage II sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A generally regular rhythm was noted, with an
average
rate of 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: This is a normal EEG in the waking and drowsy
states. No
focal, lateralizing or epileptiform features were noted.
.
CXR ([**12-19**]): Multifocal opacities consistent with multifocal
pneumonia/aspiration are overall stable with slight clearing in
the left upper lobe and slight worsening in the right upper
lobe.  Interval removal of the nasogastric tube.  Left lower
lobe atelectasis is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 M with h/o CVA s/p recent CEA, DM2, CKD and HTN who presented
with hypoxic respiratory distress [**1-4**] PNA and new-onset AFib
with RVR.
.
# Pneumonia: Multifocal PNA, treated for aspiration and HAP
given recent intubation / hospital stay with vanc/levo/flagyl x
11 days, vanc/zosyn/flagyl x 2 days, vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/flagyl x 4 days.
LENIs negative, V/Q scan intermediate probability PE. Pulm
consulted but rec no bronch as respiratory status improved. He
was taken off antibiotics x 2 days and spiked fever, tachypnic,
WBC increased from 10 -> 22 (C. diff negative), then decreased
11 after starting linezolid and levofloxacin (to complete 14 day
course on [**1-1**]). Respiratory status improved with diminished O2
requirement and resolution of tachypnea. Followup with PCP.
.
# Personality change: ?depression vs. frontal disinhibition.
Patient had been expressing wishes to die intermittently.
Occasional sundowning. Psych and neuro consulted. CT head shows
resorbed subdural hematoma, MR brain negative for acute CVA. EEG
was normal with no seizure activity. Intermittenly uncooperative
and somnolent, then spontaneously A&Ox3; likely [**1-4**] delerium
from toxic-metabolic cause in setting of significant frontal
atrophy noted on head CT. Tried on ritalin (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern
for MS change), celexa (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern for hypotension), and
remeron (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern for MS change, risk of serotonin
syndrome while on linezolid). Occasionally the patient developed
non-threatening hallucinations thought to be [**1-4**] toxic-metabolic
causes. If he develops agitation, psych recommends considering a
trial of haldol 0.5mg prn.
.
# Paroxysmal AFib: RVR to 140's at presentation, started on dilt
drip while in the ED, which was then weaned off in MICU.
Remained in sinus rhythm the rest of hospital course. No prior
h/o AFib per patient (confirmed with PCP). CHADS score 3, and
therefore would probably benefit from anticoagulation, but given
fall risk, recent SDH, comorbidites this was deferred (discussed
with PCP). Monitored on telemetry with no repeat events.
Continued metoprolol with good BP control; occasionally sinus
tachy likely [**1-4**] volume depleteion, stress, and infection.
.
# ARF on CRF: Resolved. Baseline Cre ~2.2; was 2.0 at discharge.
Most likely pre-renal azotemia in setting of hypovolemia (poor
intake, diarrhea) and responded to IVFs. Medications were
renally dosed.
.
# DM2: Diet-controlled. Hypoglycemic on transfer to MICU in
setting of starting NPH for persistant hyperglycemia; NPH was
then discontinued. Fingersticks were eventually discontinued as
serum glucose was well-controlled.
.
# CVA: s/p CEA, stable (followed by [**Doctor Last Name 1391**]). MR brain negative
for acute event. Vascular surgery made aware patient admitted,
no active issues. Cont ASA, Aggrenox.
.
# Cardiovascular: No documented h/o CAD or CHF but multiple risk
factors. Preserved EF on echo, although possible diastolic
dysfunction. CXR after MICU transfer with mild to moderate
volume overload and the patient was gently diuresed until
euvolemic. Cont ASA, statin, BB.
.
# Anemia: OB +ve stool noted while patient was in MICU, and then
intermittent positivity during rest of hospital stay.
?gastritis. Received 1 unit pRBC during admission with
appropriate increase in Hct, which remained stable. Started on
PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Recent c-scope (2 years ago per patient) negative;
denies ever having EGD or h/o GI bleeding. Would consider
pursuing outpatient GI followup.
.
# Coagulopathy: Elevated INR 1.4-1.5 at presentation likely
nutritional given poor PO intake. LFTs normal and
albumin/prealbumin low supporting nutritional deficiency.
Received vitamin K PO with slight improvement.
.
# Rash: Likely drug reaction [**1-4**] zosyn as this was only new
recent medication around the time the rash began. Serum eos
normal. The rash resolved after 1 week. Mild pruritis was
well-controlled with topical anti-itch cream.
.
# Hypernatremia: Resolved. Hypovolemic at presentation (~3.5L
H2O deficit), serum Na+ normalized with free water boluses but
recurred when stopped from poor PO intake and again improved
with free water (3L deficit). PO intake encouraged.
.
# Hypotension: Resolved after 8L of fluids in MICU. Likely [**1-4**]
hypovolemia from poor PO intake and diarrhea. Diarrhea also
resolved (C. diff neg x 3). Continued to supplement with IV
hydration and intermittent hypodermoclysis given poor POs.
.
# Hyperthyroidism: Mild with slighlty elevated free T4, slightly
depressed TSH. No thyroid nodules on exam. Difficult to
interpret in acute care setting, and therefore would suggest
rechecking as outpatient.
.
# Activity: PT worked with patient frequently. Goal OOB to chair
daily. Will likely need significant rehabilitation and will
benefit greatly from increased mobility and independence.
.
# FEN: Prethickened liquids / ground solids, PO intake
encouraged; Briefly with NG tube on tube feeds but d/c'd
according to family wishes due to somnolence and mental status
changes; Continue aspiration precautions; Repleted 'lytes prn

History of Present Illness:
62yM well known to our service who recently underwent a
combined liver/kidney transplant.  His post-operative course was
significant for malnourishment.  He required a dobhoff and tube
feeds to supplement his nutrition.  Once he was medically stable
he was transferred to rehab for further rehabilitation.  Prior
to
discharge there was some concern regarding his rising Alk Phos
levels, but they trended back down and stabilized so it was
decided to send him out with continued follow up.  He now
returns
with findings of eleveated Alk Phos at rehab at 650, AST 30 and
ALT 80.  He was not having any new symptoms or complaints and
states he is doing quite well at rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admission liver duplex demonstrated no specific son[**Name (NI) 493**]
findings to explain abnormal liver function tests. Hepatic
vasculature was patent with normal flow and resistive indices.
There was small-volume ascites. On [**1-22**] a cholangiogram was done
to assess for ductal dilatation and assess the vasculature. Post
procedure, he spiked a temperature to 104. He was transferred to
the SICU for management as he dropped his BP. He was treated
with IV fluids and antibiotics were started (meropenum and vanco
[**1-22**]). Blood cultures grew Klebsiella oxytoca and VRE
(enterococcus facium). Antibiotics were switched to Dapto and
Meropenum after 3 days to Daptomycin and Meropenum. He was
treated for a total of 12 days of dapto ([**Date range (1) 81979**]) and
meropenum ([**Date range (1) 81980**]). Subsequent blood cultures on several days
were negative. A right picc line was inserted ([**1-27**])for IV
antibiotics.

Biopsy findings demonstrated no intrahepatic duct dilation
visualized and no bile leak at the hepaticojejunal anastomosis
site. A biopsy was then performed with features representing
indeterminate to mild acute cellular rejection. This was treated
by increasing his prograf with a target trough level of 15.
Prograf levels increased to 15-16 and as high as 18. Dosage was
adjusted. LFTs were notable for the alk phos dropping to 612
from 963, but then alk phos continued to rise.

On [**1-28**], an MRCP was performed to assess for biliary obstruction
or leak. This demonstrated diffuse mild-to-moderate dilatation
of the entire intrahepatic biliary system. There were several
foci of intrahepatic biliary stenosis as well as a 2-cm segment
of the distal CBD which demonstrated wall thickening and
associated luminal stenosis. Distally, the segment abutted the
anastomosis of CBD and jejunum. Between the diaphragm and the
right lobe of the liver, was a small hematoma. There was a small
amount of free fluid around the hepatic and splenic flexure.

On [**1-29**], he was re-biopsied with findings concerning for biliary
obstruction or ischemia. Prograf was adjusted. On [**2-3**], a
cholangiogram was done showing no obvious dilation of
intrahepatic ducts and possible stricture at lower common bile
duct close to the anastomosis site with the contrast flowing
freely down to the small bowel. An internal-external biliary
draining catheter was placed. After this procedure, LFTs trended
down with alk phos decreasing to 446 from 1155 over
approximately six days on [**2-10**].

He developed severe bilateral upper and lower extremity tremors
and ataxic gait likely from prograf toxicity causing a
significant decline in his ability to ambulate. Neurology was
consulted. This was felt to be related to the prograf, but
thyroid function studies and a MRI of the head were done to
assess his cerebellum. TFTs were significant for a slightly low
T3 otherwise TSH and T4 were normal. The MRI was read by neuro
and neurosurgery who felt that the MRI was unchanged compared to
previous in [**2149-11-8**], prior to starting on immunosuppression.
The two left hemipheric lesions were stable in size,
non-enhancing with contrast, and of unclear etiology. His CSF
profile [**12-8**] was normal, with no evidence of inflammation or
pleiocytosis. He had CSF PCR negative at that time for
HSV/EBV/CMV/[**Male First Name (un) 2326**]/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] there was no need to repeat a spinal
tap. HCV viral load was undetectable. It was not clear what the
lesions  represented, but given no further growth or lack of
enhancement, infection or malignancy were remote possibilities.
A repeat MRI brain WITHOUT CONTRAST (as lesions did not enhance
and given risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis/Nephrogenic
Fibrosing Dermopathy)was recommended in 3 months to re-evaluate
for evolution of these lesions. With adjustment of prograf, the
trough levels decreased to 10 and the tremors diminished.
Consequently, his mobility improved.

Nutritionally, he required a feeding tube initially, but
demonstrated sufficient caloric intake to remove the feeding
tube. He was tolerating a regular diet.

Vital signs were stable and he remained afebrile. PT worked with
daily and recommended [**Hospital 41518**] rehab. He was accepted at
[**Hospital1 **].

On the day of discharge, his PTC was removed, but the old
insertion site continued to leak some bile. A urostomy pouch was
placed over this site to collect and record volume of output.
The roux tube that was present since his liver translant surgery
was kept capped. Site was without redness or drainage.

Twice weekly labs should be drawn for cbc, chem 10, LFTs and
trough prograf level with results called to [**Hospital1 18**] Transplant
Office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**].

hyperperfusion-petechial hemorrhage-laminar necrosis or residual
blood from prior hemorrhage, age-indeterminate. No large
intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
2. Bilateral occipital lobe hypodensity, right larger than left,
unchanged left caudate head hypodensity likely consistent with
chronic ischemic changes.
.
CT head [**2-26**] after the administration of heparin:
- Areas of subacute infarction in the occipital lobes
bilaterally, unchanged since [**2154-2-26**]. Evolving hemorrhage within
the infarctions. Close interval followup is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71166**] was admitted on [**2154-2-26**] after routine duplex scanning
of his legs revealed right superficial and peroneal vein DVT and
left posterior tibial DVTs.  Due to his recent occipital strokes
a CT scan was obtained prior to the administration of heparin.
The CT scan showed bilateral occipital lobe hypodensities, right
larger than left, unchanged from prior studies.  Neurology was
consulted and a heparin gtt was started at a low rate.  A few
hours after the heparin was started he began to complain of new
visual hallucinations that he did not have before.  Due to
concerns for hemorrhagic conversion of his prior CVA he was
transferred to the ICU for monitoring and a head CT was obtained
that showed areas of subacute infarction in the occipital lobes
bilaterally, unchanged since [**2154-2-26**] with evolving hemorrhage
within the infarctions.  His heparin gtt was immediately stopped
and 2 more follow up head CTs showed no change.  An EEG was
obtained and this show signs of encephalopathy but no seizure
activity.  His hallucinations continued and Keppra [**Hospital1 **] was
started.  A 24hour EEG was obtained, an initial interpretation
showed no seizure activity, but the final read is still pending
as of his discharge.  He was transferred back to the floor.  His
diet was advanced and he is having bowel function.  His
labarotory work is stable.  His visual hallucinations are vastly
improving and his main complaints are blurry vision in his left
visual fields.  He is discharged on Keppra with transplant as
well as neurology follow up.  A Cardiology consult was obtained
to evaluate for closure of his ASD as an appropriate date.  His
tacro dose was decreased to 1.5mg [**Hospital1 **] based on his level.  His
prednisone was decreased to 15mg daily.

of PNA several years ago admitted recently with PNA treated with
PO levoflox but now re-presenting with fevers and fatigue. Per
patient he was in his USOH until Sunday when he developed severe
fatigue. He says this was how he felt with his last bout of PNA.
He had a dry cough but is not sure if he also had fevers because
he didnt have a thermometer. He was admitted here with a CAP and
treated with one dose of levofloxacin IV and then switched to PO
levofloxacin and sent home.
 Over the last few days he has not felt any better and every
time the tylenol wears off he feels even worse. Mostly he has
fatigue. The cough is non-productive but it does hurt him to
cough. He denies myalgias. He had one episode of diarrhea this
morning but otherwise no GI complaints although he has not been
able to drink or eat much. Today he was feeling even worse and
he took his temperature and it was 103 so he decided to come to
the Ed.

Micro:  blood, sputum cultures . . .

Urine legionella negative
Cdiff . . .

Images:
POrtable CXR: RLL PNA

IMPRESSION:

1. Right lower lobar pneumonia with a small amount of adjacent
pleural
effusion. No large obstructing mass is seen, although
post-treatment imaging
can be considered if there is a concern for malignancy.

2. Nonspecific ground-glass opacity within the right upper lobe,
likely
reflecting mild inflammatory change.

3. Mild left atelectasis with a trace amount of pleural
effusion.

4. Small pericardial effusion.

5. Splenomegaly, incompletely imaged.


Brief Hospital Course:
# PNA: Failed PO levoquin and CURB65 score high enough to be
re-admitted. Likely had resistent bacterial PNA and needs Rx
with IV antibiotics for longer prior to switching to PO. He was
treated with Vanc/ctx/azithro and then switched to
vanc/meropenem/gent/azithro at the recommendations of ID when he
continued to have hypoxia and fevers. A CT showed no abscess or
fluid collection. He underwent bronchoscopy which revealed clear
airways but blood-tinged fluid on BAL. Blood, urine, and sputum
cultures had no growth. Urinary legionella was negative. His
antibiotics were eventually tailored to meropenem, gentamicin,
vancomycin prior to transfer out of MICU and doses increased
according to levels. His oxygenation requirements decreased and
he was transferred out of the MICU. He was treated with mucinex
and codeine as well as nebs PRN for symptom control. his final
antibiotic regimen was vanc to be continued for 5 more days,
gentamycin to be continued for two more days and ciprofloxacin
to be continued for 2 more days. He completed a course of
azithromycin as well as meropenem. PPD was negative.

#  Hyponatremia: likely [**1-28**] to either the PNA or dehydration
from poor po intake. Improved with IVF. Discharge sodium 138.

#  Renal Insufficiency: likely pre-renal [**1-28**] fever and
dehydration from poor po intake. Improved with IVR. Discharge
creatinine 0.8.

# Tachycardia: Likely [**1-28**] dehydration from fever and poor po
intake. Resolved with IVF.

# Diarrhea: likely [**1-28**] ADR from ABx but could be cdiff or [**1-28**]
legionella which would explain both the lung and GI findings.
Urinary legionella was negative and Cdiff negatiee as well.
Diarrhea resolved.

# CAD: Stable. ACE inhibitor and statin held in the setting of
acute illness. Restarted on time of discharge.

# GERD: Continued home nexium
# Code: confirmed full
# Emergency Contact:  wife: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76344**]

Transitions of care:
- Multiple cultures and serologies pending and will be followed
up by the infectious disease department at his follow up
appointment. They should call him within 48 horus with this
appointment and if they do not call he should call them. He was
discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab with these instructions.
- The PICC line needs to be removed when the antibiotics are
finished.

Brief Hospital Course:
Due to his large perisplenic hematoma, Mr [**Known lastname 30362**] was admitted
to the Trauma SICU for close hemodynamic monitoring. On HD #1,
his serial HCTs were [**Last Name (LF) 30363**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a repeat CT AP was
obtained which showed extension of hematoma. He was transfused 1
unit PRBC + 1U FFP. In addition, his home digoxin restarted. On
HD #2, his diet was advanced to regular. Due to fluid overload,
he was started on a lasix drip with improvement in his
respiratory status. For pain control, an epidural was attempted
but could not be placed. On [**5-20**], however, a repeat attempt at
placement was successful with marked improvement in his pain.
Over the previous days he was quite delirious which greatly
improved with placement of the epidural, improved pain control
and cessation of narcotics. Heparin sc was started. EP
interrogated his pacemaker and discovered no fires or
arrhythmias. On [**5-21**], his lasix changed from drip to home PO
dose. Mental status continued to improve but he was kept in the
ICU as he had been so recently delirious. On [**5-22**], the patient
had continued stable hematocrit checks, was tolerating a regular
diet and A&O x2-3, so he was transferred to the surgical floor.

Note completed by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 30364**], NP:

Transferred to the surgical floor on [**5-22**].  Epidural infusing
bupivicaine only, no narcotic related to prior confusion. His
epidural infusion was stopped on [**5-23**] in preparation for
removal.  Foley replaced [**5-22**] after inability to void after
foley removed.  Evaluated by occupational therapy to determine
need for rehabilitation and to assess his cognitive ability. He
was re-evaluated on [**5-26**] and it was determined at that time that
he was safe to go home.  He will still need cognitive evaluation
in 1 month related to his head injury.

His atrial fibrillation has been controlled with medications.
He is tolerating a regular diet without complaints of nausea or
vomitting.  He is afebrile and his vital signs are stable. He is
alert, oriented, and conversant.  His home medications have been
resumed except for his coumadin. He has resumed his diuretics,
last creatinine 1.7.   He is voiding without difficulty.

He is preparing for discharge home with instructions to
follow-up with the acute care service in 2 weeks and cognitive
neurology in 1 month.  It is recommended that he follow-up with
his primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-28**]  days to discuss resumption of
his coumadin and to check electrolytes.

Of note:  his coumadin has been on hold related to his splenic
hematoma.  Will need to be addressed by his primary care
provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-28**] days.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after you were involved in a
motor vehicle accident in which you sustained rib fractures,
bleeding around your spleen, and loss of consciousness.  You
were intially admitted to the intensive care unit for
monitoring, but have been managed on the general surgical floor.
Your rib pain had been controlled with an epidural catheter.
Your pain has diminished and you are now on oral analgesics.
You are preparing for discharge home with the following
instructions:

Your injury caused bilatgeral rib fractures which can cause
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths
because of the pain.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the
dose and notify your physician.

*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.

*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing
and deep breathing.

*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.

*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.

*  Do NOT smoke


*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs ( crepitus ).

You also had bleeding around your spleen, here are additional
instructions;

If you suddenly become dizzy, lightheaded, feeling as if you are
going to pass out go to the nearest Emergency Room as this could
be a sign that you are having inernal bleeding from your liver
or spleen injury.

Please follow up with your primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week about
resuming your coumadin and follow-up lab work


Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with the acute care service in 2 weeks.  You
can schedule this appointment by calling # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 600**].

Please follow up with your Primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-28**] days
regarding resuming your coumadin.

Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], cognitive neurology, in 1
month.  The telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6335**]

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-2-15**] 9:06 AM

CHEST: AP portable semi-upright view. The nasogastric tube and
the left internal jugular central venous catheter remain in good
positions. There is interval worsening of bilateral perihilar
and basilar opacities, consistent with increasing congestive
heart failure. There are persistent opacities in the right and
left upper lobe, consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
Multiple surgical clips are again seen in the upper mid abdomen
and just above the gastroesophageal junction.

IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure.
2. Unchanged right and left upper lobe pneumonia versus
aspiration.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2106-2-15**] 4:20 PM

CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Emphysema is again noted,
with multiple bullae in the middle and upper lobes. There are
confluent ground-glass opacities as well as interlobular septal
thickening in both upper lobes, right middle lobe, lingula, and
the superior and anterior portions of the lower lobes. The
opacities are most dense in the upper lobes. Small peripheral
centrilobular ground-glass opacities are present throughout both
lower lobes, similar in appearance to [**2104-7-16**]. While the
centrilobular and confluent ground glass opacities are
consistent with aspiration or pneumonia, presence of
interstitial septal thickening also suggest pulmonary edema.
While there is some nodularity within the opacities, nodular
opacities that were seen in the left upper and right lower lobes
on [**2105-7-16**] are no longer present. There is no evidence of an
abscess.

The trachea, right and left main stem bronchi are mildly
dilated. Mild-to- moderate bronchiectasis is noted in the upper
lobes, right middle lobe and lingula. Dependent secretions are
noted in the trachea.

There are numerous enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, increased
in number and size compared to [**2104-7-16**]. The largest right
superior mediastinal node measures 12 mm in short axis diameter.
The largest upper right paratracheal node measures 11 mm. The
largest lower right paratracheal node measures 9 mm. The largest
right para-aortic node measures 12 mm. The largest subcarinal
node measures 15 mm. The largest right para-esophageal node
measures 13 mm. Numerous subcentimeter nodes are present in both
hila.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no
pericardial effusion. Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications
are present in the thoracic aorta. Mural thrombus is noted in
the proximal abdominal aorta.

There is an unchanged ill-defined hypodensity in the right lobe
of the thyroid gland, measuring approximately 2 x 1 cm.

There is an approximately 4 cm hypodense lesion in the lower
pole of the spleen, unchanged compared to the [**2106-2-13**] abdominal
CT, which may represent a splenic infarction. Scattered
calcified granulomas are again noted in the liver. Stones are
again seen in the gallbladder. Surgical clips are again noted in
the porta hepatis and in the region of the gastroesophageal
junction. The imaged portions of the pancreas, adrenal glands,
and kidneys appear unremarkable. The imaged bones appear
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, confluent in the upper
and middle lobes, consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
Recurrent interlobular septal thickening is consistent with
superimposed pulmonary edema. Given foci of nodularity,
follow-up is recommended after treatment. No evidence of an
abscess.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Mild central tracheal dilatation. Diffuse mild-to-moderate
bronchiectasis in the upper and middle lobes.
4. Increased number and size of mediastinal and bilateral hilar
lymph nodes, which may be reactive. However, metastatic disease
cannot be excluded, and follow-up after treatment is
recommended.
5. Hypodense splenic lesion, unchanged since [**2106-2-13**], compatible
with an infarct.
6. Cholelithiasis.
7. Unchanged hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid.

have increased since the prior study consistent with small
airways disease. There is mild hazy opacity within the lung
bases which could represent normal lung at expiration, however
mild ground glass airspace disease cannot be excluded.

There is a hepatic granuloma within the dome of the liver. No
concerning hepatic lesions. There are multiple small gallstones
dependently within the gallbladder. No gallbladder wall
thickening. No biliary ductal dilatation or choledocholithiasis
evident. There is a choledochojejunostomy, which is normal in
appearance.

Within the inferior aspect of the spleen, there is a large
hypodense lesion, without enhancement measuring 4.4 x 4.3 x 3.9
cm that has significantly increased since the [**5-7**] study. There
is an adjacent smaller similar- appearing lesion lateral to this
larger lesion. These are nonspecific but considerations would
include a splenic infarct. There is no stranding around these
lesions, however infection of the lesions cannot be excluded.
Small splenic hemangioma is also again noted unchanged.

The pancreas is normal in appearance. The patient has undergone
gastric bypass with a gastrojejunostomy. Adrenal glands are
normal in appearance. No bowel wall thickening. No evidence of
bowel wall thickening or bowel obstruction. The appendix
contains contrast within it and gas, possibly from prior CT
scan. No evidence for appendicitis. Small amount of fluid within
the right lower quadrant is nonspecific.

The kidneys show heterogeneous hypoenhancement symmetrically in
a patchy geographic pattern in some locations. These areas have
heterogeneous enhancement still on nephrographic phase. There is
no persistent staining on the delayed images, nor is there
contrast within the kidneys on the pre- contrast CT remaining
from [**2106-2-11**] angiogram. These findings are nonspecific but
considerations would include embolic phenomenon such as
cholesterol or other emboli. Of note, there is a large calcified
plaque within the right renal artery just beyond its origin with
at least moderate narrowing of the right renal artery. There is
also moderate narrowing of the left renal artery at its origin.
There are multiple cysts within the kidneys bilaterally. There
are multiple hypoattenuating lesions which are too small to
characterize but likely cysts.

No lymphadenopathy or ascites.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:
The urinary bladder has a Foley catheter within it and is
incompletely distended. No definite urinary bladder abnormality.
There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. Bowel
within the pelvis is within normal limits. There is a rectal
tube with balloon inflated within the rectum. Subsequent
administration of rectal contrast shows no leakage of contrast
and no other abnormality. No lymphadenopathy.

CT ARTERIOGRAM WITH IV CONTRAST:
There is diffuse atherosclerotic plaque within the aorta with a
large amount of plaque within the infrarenal aorta. There is an
ulcerated plaque within the infrarenal aorta with a small neck.
This does not extend beyond the normal contour of the aorta. The
left common iliac artery is occluded, as before. There is
reconstitution of the left external iliac artery from retrograde
flow and there is minimal flow within the left internal iliac
artery. The right common iliac artery is patent at its origin
and then there is a bypass graft from the right common iliac
artery to the right common femoral artery. Native right common
iliac artery distally and the external iliac artery is occluded
with an old stent in place. The iliac-femoral graft is widely
patent. Just distal to its insertion within the right common
femoral artery, there is a right to left femoral-femoral bypass
graft which is widely patent. This is just superior to an
excluded partially thrombosed old femoral- femoral bypass graft
which contains gas within it, likely from recent surgery.
Bilateral superficial femoral arteries are patent proximally
though diminutive. There are small fluid collections about
bilateral common femoral arteries near the graft
origin/insertions, both of which contain small amounts of gas,
likely related to recent surgery. Just distal to the insertion
site of the femoral-femoral bypass graft on the left is a round
fluid collection that on pre-contrast images is heterogeneous in
density and post-contrast images shows a small amount of
contrast outside the lumen of the adjacent arteries with
progressive increased density dependently within the collection
seen, making this highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm. This
is best demonstrated on series 2, 3, and 4, images 90-94 and
series 6 B, images 186-189. The arteries distal to the graft
sites are patent within the visualized portions.

SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and celiac artery are all patent and without evidence
of proximal stenoses. As mentioned above, the right renal artery
has a large calcified plaque just beyond its origin with at
least moderate stenosis. The left renal artery has moderate
stenosis at its origin.

BONE WINDOWS: There is multilevel lumbar disc degeneration. No
suspicious bone lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Aortic atherosclerosis with ulcerated plaque in the
infrarenal aorta. Occluded left common iliac artery with
external iliac artery reconstitution from retrograde flow from
fem-fem bypass graft. Patent right common iliac- femoral bypass
graft and right to left femoral-femoral bypass graft with patent
superficial femoral artery distal to the bypass grafts in the
visualized portions.

2. Just distal to the left insertion of the fem-fem bypass graft
with findings are highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm.
[**Female First Name (un) **] ultrasound of this area is recommended to further
evaluate.

3. Gas and fluid about the bilateral femoral [**Female First Name (un) 1106**] operative
sites and gas within the old thrombosed fem-fem bypass graft
likely related to surgery.

4. Increased size of hypodense splenic lesions that could
represent infarcts. No secondary signs of infection, however
this cannot be excluded.

5. Patent SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] without evidence of bowel abnormality.

6. Bilateral patchy heterogeneous perfusion abnormalities within
the kidneys suggesting recent bilateral renal insult, possibly
from embolic phenomenon such as cholesterol emboli. There is
also bilateral renal artery stenosis, slightly worse on the
right than the left, at least a moderate degree.

7. Bilateral pulmonary small airways disease, worse in the bases
than in [**2105-5-3**]. If clinically indicated, high resolution chest
CT could be performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and started on anti-coagulation secondary
to LE graft coagulopathy.  Patient was started on a heparin gtt
with goal of 60-80.  Patients Coumadin was initially held.
Patient had groin exploration/angiogram.  Patient was given an
epidural.  Patient tolerated procedure and in PACU area it was
noticed that Hct levels had come down.  Patient was transfused 2
units.  Patient's anticoags were held while he got his
transfusion and then was re-started.  Heme was consulted for
this and suggested HIT.  Patient most-likely was sub-therapeutic
on lovenox.  Typical dosing for Lovenox is 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] and he was
only on 30mg/day.  Patient was admitted to SICU.   Patient was
continued on broad spctrum
antibiotics(Vanco/Clinda/Ceftaz/Flagyl).  Patient's groin
dressings were continually monitored during this time while in
the unit where it was noticed to be draining.  Patient was
screened for HIT and started on Argatroban.  Patients Argatroban
was started/stopped [**Hospital 58097**] hospital stay.  Patients
epidural and NG-tube were DC's post-op day 4 and Clinda was DC'd
as per IS requests.  Patient transferred to VICU and Argatroban
and Coumadin were re-started.  Through-out the patients entire
hospital stay the goal was to acquire a therapeutic state
between (2.0-3.0)  Patient was started on Lovenox sq on final
hospital day and it was explained to patient that when he get's
discharged from hospital he won't be able to check his lovenox
levels.  It was suggested to patient that he stay in the
hospital until his PT becomes therapeutic but the patient
requested he leave and go home on Lovenox sub-q.  Patient was
instructed to f/u w/ PCP(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5456**] qod for coag checks.
Patient wwas also Dc'd on Coumadin 3mg hs, ASA 81mg qd.  Patient
was also given Abx- (Levo/Flagyl).

Discharge Diagnosis:
Thrombosed femoral-femoral graft and iliofemoral graft with
bilateral extremity ischemia.

Hypercoagulable state.


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
Please restart your home medications.  You may shower regularly,
but no tub baths.  Pat your incisions dry.  If there continues
to be drainage from your incision, place dry gauze over it.
Call a physician or go to the emergency room if you experience
fever >101.4F, pain unrelieved by medication, or foul-smelling
drainage coming from your incision.

Discharge Instructions:

You are to be discharged on coumadin. You must have your INR
followed. This measures the level of coumadin in the blood. This

level must be between [**2-5**]. Your PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] been [**Name (NI) 653**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] will
follow your INR.

You are also on Lovenox this is again a blood thinner, You must
give yourself shots twice a day. You are to take Lovenox untill
the Coumadin (INR ) is between [**2-5**]. When your coumadin level is
appropriate. You may stop the Lovenox.

WOUND CARE:

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

Redness in or drainage from your wound(s).

New pain, numbness or discoloration of your lower or upper
extremities (notably on the side of the incision).

Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.



OTHER INFORMATION:

You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A
dressing may cover you??????re wound / incision site and this should
be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time
and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will
have sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This will be
done by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment.

Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are
not, an appointment will be made for you to return for
removal.).

When the sutures / staples are removed the doctor may or may not
place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.
These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on.
If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off
with warm water and soap in the shower.

Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for
two weeks after surgery.

You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A
dressing may cover you??????re wound / incision site and this should
be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time
and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You may
have staples and or sutures, which are usually removed in 4
weeks. This will be done by the Surgeon on your follow-up
appointment.

Limit strenuous activity  and or heavy lifting until the wound
is well healed. Activity may prevent the wound from healing.

Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon.

Try to keep your affected limb elevated when not in use, This
decreases swelling to the affected wound and helps in the
healing process.

You may have an ace wrap around the affected limb with the
wound. This helps prevent swelling to the area. You may take
this off at night. But when you are doing activity the ace wrap
should be worn.

ANTIBIOTICS:

You may have a prescription for antibiotics. Take as directed.
Be sure you take the full course even if the wound looks well
healed. Failure to do so may lead to infection.

History of Present Illness:
. Boiseau is a pleasant 65 yo man with paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, bipolar disorder and h/o EtOH abuse who presented
to the ED today with complaints of R arm pain, achiness and
""feeling off.""
His wife reports that he did not complain of any of the above on
the morning of admission, either. Per his wife, the pt awoke
early this morning, which is unusual, and was c/o some R
shoulder pain (the site of the vaccination. He was just a little
""off,"" and he fell in the living room. Both he and his wife deny
loss of consciousness.

Social History:
Lives with wife, 3 cigs per day for 50 years, last EtOH was 3
months ago when he had 1 drink.


Family History:
NC

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, he was initially hypotensive (70s/40s) and
bradycardic (50s). He was treated as a beta-blocker overdose and
given IVF (~2L NS) and glucagon, with improvement in his
hemodynamics. He had a CXR, CTA and CT torso, all of which were
unrevealing.
.
He recieved empiric broad spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole
500 mg IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV and vancomycin 1 g IV) and was
transferred to the medical floor. On the floor, he developed
rigors, fevers to 104.1 with tachycardia to the 110s and
hypoxemia to 88% on RA. There was no witnessed aspiration event,
although the pt does have a h/o aspiration for which he was
treated at an OSH.  He received a dose of diazepam for possible
EtOH withdrawal that had no immediate effect. Of note, the pt
did receive a pneumococcal vaccination on the day prior to
admission.
.
On transfer to the ICU, the pt reported feeling well. He denied
shortness of breath, and reported that the arm pain that he
presented with had gotten better. He denies lightheadedness,
neck stiffness, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, abdominal
pain, dysuria.
.
ICU COURSE;
Fever hypotension/Shock: Given the pt's history of aspiration,
considered aspiration pneumonitis. Although he did not have a
witnessed aspiration event, his wife reports a nearly identical
admission ~2 years ago. Also in the differential were pulmonary
embolism, an intrabdominal source of infection with associated
sepsis, a reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine-which
chronologically fits well with the story/cytokine like effect,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome. PE is
unlikely given his normal CTA. An intrabdominal infection is
unlikely given his normal CT scan and abdominal exam. A reaction
to the pneumococcal vaccine is the most likely factor at this
point as there is no signs of infection/endocrine phenomenon.
His CK is not elevated, and he is not rigid on exam, making NMS
unlikely. He is, if anything, hyporeflexive, making serotonin
syndrome unlikely.  As his hypotension was accompanied by
bradycardia it is felt likely that an etiology could be beta
blocker overdose (not felt to be intentional).
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim was negative, no growth from his cultres at 48
hours.  TSH was normal.  An EKG showed 1st degree AVB.  He was
given IV fluids, stress dose steroids, vanco/levo/flagyl for
broad empiric coverage and pan cultured.
A CXR on [**7-8**] showed ?LLL infitlrate vs atelectasis.  Diuresis
with 10mg IV lasix was performed and a PA and LAT were done
after diuresis that showed a retrocardiac density, no overload
but clinical suspicion of pneumonia was low.
An echo did not show any vegetations.
Pneumovax was added to his allergy list.
.
#hypoxemia-Pt had 02 req of 2-3L prior to transfer. He did not
have symptoms such as cough/SOB/wheeze. Pt was given aggressive
hydration on admission for hypotension. Resultant CXR showed
this as well as crackles on exam.  He autodiuresed once his BP
had improved and his CXR showed improvement in hilar edema.
However  there was question of LLL infiltrate on CXR [**7-8**] and
persistent 3L NC O2 requirement.  Vanco was discontinued and
levo/flagyl was continued until diuresis and repeat PA and LAT
to assess LLL, CXR showed a left retrocardiac density (pna vs
atelectasis)-however he no longer had an oxygen requirement even
with ambulation.  He will follow up with his PCP.
.
#Incontinence-Pt had two episodes of fecal incontinence on the
day of discharge, pt reports this is a chronic occurence which
happens when he is not at home.  He denies back pain, rectal
exam was with normal tone, no saddle anesthesia, no paraspinal
tenderness.  Pt given prescription for bedside commode.  He was
instructed to seek medical attention if any symptoms of leg
weakness, saddle anesthesia, back pain developed or if the
incontinence continued at home.

.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: He had runs of irregular SVT
on telemetry.  He was continued on flecainide.  His metoprolol
was held due to bradycardia.
An echo showed LVEF 70%, mild AS
.
# Bipolar disorder: antipsychotics/SSRI restarted.
.
# FEN/Lytes: Regular diet, replete lytes prn
.
# Prophylaxis: For DVT prophylaxis he was given Heparin SC 5000
tid, pneumoboots, bowel reg.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of alcohol abuse


Discharge Condition:
stable, afebrile, BP 120/77, 94%ra, HR 61, ambulatory


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with symptoms of weakness, you had low blood
pressure and a slow heart rate.  You had imaging of your head,
chest, and abdomen without evidence of infection or blood clot
in your lungs.  You received antibiotics as infection was
suspected.  You had no evidence of a problem with your adrenal
glands, or thyroid.  It is believed that your low blood pressure
was due to a reaction from your pneumovax that was given the day
before.  Also, since your heart rate was low it is possible that
this was due to a high dose of beta blocker.
In addition you had two episodes of fecal incontinence which you
have had in the past when you are not home.  Your rectal exam
was normal. If this does not improve when you go home you need
to seek medical attention. You have been given a prescription
for a bedside commode.
You should continue taking your medications as prescribed. You
should not take your metoprolol until you follow up with with
your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Please seek medical attention for chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, weakness, dizzyness, or any other
concerning symptoms.
It is very important that you follow up as outlined below.

Chief Complaint:
fevers, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 39 year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy,
chronic aspiration, GERD, ? ulcerative colitis who presents with
low grade temps at home, cough, abdominal pain.  He is
accompanied by his mother.  [**Name (NI) **] had a colonoscopy on [**3-17**] to
evaluate for IBD, with fairly normal appearing bowel but
biopsies are pending.  Afterwards, he was constipated, but then
started have very loose stools yesterday and today.  He has had
low grade temps, about 100 at home.  Also, his mother states his
cough seems to be worse lately.  He has also been complaining of
abdominal pain as well.  He gets his nutrition via his G-tube at
home.  Also of note, he recently completed a course of
azithromycin for a skin boil.
.
In the ED, inital vitals were 101.2, 140, 113/79, 28, 92%RA.  He
was given a total of 3L IVFs in the ED with  improvement of his
tachycardia.  He was also given morphine and zofran in the ED.
Subsequently, his SBP dropped to the 80s and high 70s, and was
not improving with IVFs.  He was started on peripheral dopamine.
 There were lengthy discussions with the family regarding a
central line, but they did not want one at this time.  His CXR
was concerning for a LLL consolidation.  He underwent CT
abdomen/pelvis which did not show any specific findings, but did
show some inflammation of the rectum and ? prostatitis.  Rectal
exam did not show e/o tenderness of his prostate. He was given
vancomycin, flagyl, and gentamicin in the ED.  He has multiple
abx allergies. He was then transferred to the ICU for further

.
[**3-21**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is apparent mild rectal
thickening, which may relate to recent instrumentation or be
inflammatory in nature. A slightly  edematous appearance of the
prostate and seminal vesicles is again seen, but of unclear
etiology. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral fat and fluid-containing inguinal hernias are
identified. Osseous structures demonstrate a right convex
curvature of the lumbosacral spine. There are bilateral pars
defects of the L5 vertebral body, without evidence of antero- or
retrolisthesis. There are apparent undescended or high-riding
testicles, for which non-urgent scrotal ultrasound should be
consisdered.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of perforation or abscess.
2. Mild rectal thickening may be inflammatory or post-procedural
in nature.
3. Consider non-urgent scrotal ultrasound.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 39 year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy,
chronic aspiration, GERD who presents with fevers, cough,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea with persistent hypotension.
.
Plan:
# Hypotension - on initial admit, febrile, tachycardic, and had
leukocytosis.  Potential likely sources included LLL pneumonia
with infiltrate on CXR, c.diff given diarrhea and recent abx
exposure.  Other possible causes are prostate though no specific
findings on exam. urine clear. no clear reason to suspect
meningitis (no neck stiffness than baseline per mother).  GI was
consulted.  Family deferred CVL; team discussed risks of
dopamine peripherally.  Dopamine was initially given for ~10
hours to maintian MAPs>60.  Pt was initially treated for
possible aspiration pna and cdiff with vanco, gentamicin, and
flagyl.  On hospital day #2, gentamicin and vancomycin were
discontinued and flaygl was continued as the infiltrates on cxr
were not felt to be the active site of infection.  Patient did
not have evidence of c.diff and was discontinued.  The patient
clinically improved and was discharged home on loperamide.
.
# Hypotension: as above, thought likely component of
dehydration, medication effect from meds given in the ED and
infection.  Pt was treated with IVF and initially with dopamine.
 Hemodynamics were stabilized.
.
# Abd pain/gerd:  CT scan ruled out acute pathology, suggested
duodenitis.  CXR suggested possible chronic aspiration.  Pt
remained on his at-home PPI and H2 blocker.  He was restarted on
his TFs via G-tube on hospital day #2.
.
# Seizure d/o: continued home phenobarb and diazepam
.

Chief Complaint:
Lithium Toxicity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 553**] [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of bipolar
disorder, hypothyroidism, psoriatic arthitis, and diabetes
mellitus who presents with mental status changes since [**8-2**].
According to her family she was in her usual state of health
until about a week ago when she started having difficulty with
word finding, short term memory, using household items, and was
walking slowly.  They also state that she seemed slightly
unsteady while walking but has had no other abnormal movements.
Of note, she was prescribed TMP/SMX on [**7-30**] for nasal cellulitis.
 Her son, a nurse, suspected lithium toxicity and called her PCP
who referred them to the ED.

In the ED, her initial vitals were T 98.8, HR 63, BP 144/64, RR
20,  100% RA.  She was found to have a Cr of 1.3 from a baseline
of 0.7 and a lithium level of 2.0.  Glucose was 215 (she has had
episodes of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic episodes in the past).
Toxicology was consulted, recommending dialysis due to her
symptoms.  Nephrology recommended aggressive hydration first,
and regardless, the patient refused to have dialysis or Foley
catheters placed.  She received 3 L NS in the ED with marked
improvements in her symptoms, although she did not return to
baseline.  She was admitted to the MICU for monitoring and
aggressive diuresis.

Upon arrival, her vitals were T 36.4, HR 66, BP 154/69, RR 19,
Sat 99% RA.  She was comfortable and in NAD.

ROS:  Positive for loose stools for several months, and
increased urinary frequency for one day.  She had no fevers,
chills, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, urinary
frequency, or extremity pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 553**] [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of
insulin-dependent DMII, bipolar disorder, and psoriatic
arthritis who presents with altered mental status, acute kidney
injury, and elevated lithium levels.

# Altered mental status: Altered mental status most likely cause
by lithium toxicity in the setting of acute kidney injury. No
evidence of infection on UA, no fever or leukocytosis. She has a
history of AMS with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states, but her
hyperglycemia was relatively mild and her serum osmolarity was
normal.  Toxicology initially recommended dialysis, but
nephrology recommended trying aggressive diuresis before
dialyzing the patient, who said that she would refuse a dialysis
catheter. Lithium was held, [**Known lastname **] was held and she was
hydrated agressively with LR, since patient has received 6 L NS
and developed a hyperchloremic acidosis. Lithium levels were
checked Q6hours and she was discharged when Lithium levels
returned to [**Location 213**]

# Acute kidney injury: Her creatinine was elevated to 1.3 from a
baseline of 0.7 on admission.  This was thought to be most
likely intrinsic from TMP/SMX usage, but there she may have had
prerenal physiology as well due to decreased PO intake.  There
was no evidence of obstruction or infection. [**Location **] and
[**Location **] were held, she was hydrated and electrolytes were
followed.

# Diabetes mellitus: Chronic issue which was stable during
admission. She was kept on her sliding scale insulin, metformin
was held. She refused to take her long acting insulin

# Psoriatic arthritis: Symptoms were stable.  She can continue
taking her Methotrexate and Enbrel as an outpatient

# Hypothyroidism: Chronic, stable. Continued home levothyroxine.

# Bipolar and anxiety disorders: Chronic, stable.  She has no
mood symptoms and her altered mental status is not at all
consistent with mania or depression.  We continued her home
benzodiazepines and held lithium in the setting of acute
toxicity.

# Anemia: Initial hematocrit was normal, but that may be in the
setting of hemoconcentration.  No evidence of acute bleeding.
Stool Guiac was negative and serial crits were stable.

Transitional Issues:
- She was told to hold her [**Location **]. Restarting should be
decided by outpatient physician
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] may have increased her Lithium level in setting of
[**Last Name (un) **]. [**Last Name (un) **] should not be used for her in the future. Again,
she was instructed to follow up with her outpatient PCP
regarding [**Last Name (un) **] use.
- She needs to be encouraged to keep her outpatient
appointments.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 1806**],

It was a pleasure treating you during your hospitalization. You
were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with Lithium toxicity and Acute Kidney
Injury. It is believed that because of your nasal cellulitis you
became dehydrated which affected your kidneys ability to clear
Lithium. The [**Hospital1 **] antibiotic you took for cellulitis may have
also caused some kidney injury which may have increased your
Lithium level as well. Dehydration, kidney injury and increasing
Lithium levels in your blood caused your altered mental status,
difficulty finding words and unsteady walking. You were treated
with aggressive hydration and stopping Lithium. You were
observed and as your Lithium levels fell to normal range you
became more alert and mentally clear. You are being discharged
in stable condition with a normal Lithium level.

The following changes to your medications were made:
- You can begin taking your Lithium again tomorrow [**8-6**] at your
regular home dose
- You should avoid taking [**Month/Year (2) **] again in the future because it
may have increased Lithium levels on your body
- Please do not take your [**Month/Year (2) 21177**] until you see your
outpatient physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] can elevate Lithium levels.
- No other changes to your medications were made, please
continue taking your home medications as prescribed
- It is very important that you see your primary doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e. You have been scheduled appointments with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 14973**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67006**].

to OSH with after his wife noted seizure like activity with
subsequent unresponsiveness.
.
Per wife and pt. over the past 10 days, they noted several
episodes they thought were seizures.  These are described as
head turning to the right, facial grimacing, gutteral sounds,
lasting 1-2 mins at a time with subsequent impaired ability to
respond to her which resolved within 5-10 mins. He has had a
total of four events of similar nature, although on one
occasion, patient states that he actually recalled having these
symptoms.  She notes that on that occasion, patient was actually
yawning.  The night prior to evaluation, while going to sleep,
wife noted another episode similar to above, however this time,
after 2 mins of these events, patient did not return respond to
her at all. Wife noted that his eyes rolled backwards and this
was followed by tremmors of b/l UEs.  Wife also notes that ~ 1mo
ago he was admitted to [**Hospital **] Rehab, where multiple medication
changes were made, which she can not recall.

Imaging:
EEG [**2136-5-16**]:  This is an abnormal EEG because of the presence of

infrequent epileptic discharges in the occipital regions as well
as
nearly continuous slowing in these regions. These findings are
indicative of potential bioccipital epileptogenic foci with
underlying
subcortical dysfunction. In addition, background showed diffuse
slowing
suggestive of a mild encephalopathy of non-specific etiology. No

electrographic seizures are present.
.
CXR [**2136-5-16**]:  Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET
tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is
positioned in the stomach. Low lung volumes. Retrocardiac
opacity obscures the left hemidiaphragm. Right lung base opacity
is also noted. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar
and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is
normal.  There is no pulmonary edema. Partially imaged upper
abdomen is notable for air-filled prominent stomach and bowel
loops.
.
EEG [**2136-5-18**]:  This is an abnormal portable EEG, because of mild
diffuse
background slowing with intermittent bursts of further slowing
indicative of a mild diffuse encephalopathy of nonspecific
etiology. No
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
Note is
made of a slower than average cardiac rate.
.
MR C spine with and without contrast [**2136-5-19**] (PRELIM REPORT!!!):

1. Diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy with cystic myelomalacia
at C4-5 at the site of prior contusion. No abnormal enhancement
is seen.
2. Post-surgical changes from anterior cervical fusion and
instrumentation at C3-C5 levels and C3-C6 laminectomies.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, most
prominent at C4-C5 and C5-C6 as described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo man with history of cervical spinal cord injury, s/p C3-6
ACDF and remaining quadriplegia, indwelling suprapubic
catheter/recurrent UTIs, baclofen pump, COPD, OSA who presented
to OSH with after his wife noted seizure like activity with
subsequent unresponsiveness, s/p 1 day intubation.  Admission
complicated by hypotension, bradycardia, hypoventillation.
.
# Hypotension, bradycardia, hypopnea:  Patient presented
hypotensive to SBP high 70-80 without reflex tachycardia (HRs as
low as 40s).  Hypotension was not responsive to extensive volume
challenge (given 7.5 L NS in 24 hours).  The etiology appears to
be a combination of increased vagal tone and medication effect.
The HR and BP responded to atropine challenge, indicating
increased vagal tone from some offending process.  Started on
scopalomine patch.  He was later also started on midodrine for
further pressure support.  The etiology of the increased vagal
tone was most likely related to the UTI.  The other major
factors contributing was probably excess benzodiazepine and
opioid. He had pinpoint pupils when he first came in.  On his
home doses of medications the patient had a low respiratory
rate, and retained CO2 on ABG.  The chronic hypopnea may lead to
increased bradycardia.  The patient's diazepam and methadone
doses were decreased as below.
.
# Complicated UTI (enterococcus and serratia): Patient presented
with foul smelling urine which is consistent with prior UTIs. He
never had a fever, but he may have been unable to mount fever
due to level of spinal cord lesion. Patient was initially on
broad spectrum antibiotics but was narrowed based upon OSH
culture data.  Following 4 days of IV antibiotics, the patient
was narrowed to PO amoxicillin for enterococcus plus cipro for
serratia. Will receive a total of 14 days of abx for complicated
UTI.  Last dose of Abx to be given on [**2136-5-31**].
.
# Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.  The patient was admitted
following sustained altered mental status after an episode of
clonic movements, thought by wife to represent seizure activity.
 Resolved per wife on admission to the ICU, but patient
continued to be sedated with flat affect.  Now much improved
once decreased opiates, likely medication effect, as well as
encephalopathy related to the UTI.  Methadone dose was
decreased. Diazepam dose was decreased. EEG was negative for
seizure activity. Unclear if patient actually had seizure
leading up to original presentation but no evidence during this
hospitalization. More likely patient had toxic/metabolic
derangements described above. Of note, the patient's wife was
very concerned that the movements she saw (eyes rolling back in
head, patient becoming confused) had happened a previous time
when the patient received cymbalta. Cymbalta was stopped.
.
# ? Syringx: Patient had been recently diagnosed with cervical
syringx per OSH records. However repeat MRI here did not show
syringx but did show diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy with
cystic myelomalacia at C4-5 at the site of prior contusion. This
was conveyed to one of the patient's primary neurologists, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 27598**].
.
# COPD.  On albuterol at home.  Chronically retaining CO2.
Decreased diazepam and methadone to increase respiratory drive.
Continue albuterol PRN.
.
# DVT.  After discussion with patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 61384**], it does
not appear that any documentation of DVT exists. The patient had
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] IVC filter placed at the time of his spinal cord
injury, and has been on anticoagulation since then. Current
recommendations are that patients with IVF filters be
anticoagulated if there are no contraindications (since IVC
thrombi can develop). Given absence of contraindications, the
patient's coumadin was continued.
.
# OSA:  Patient has previous diagnosis of OSA however he has
declined CPAP at home and here due to discomfort.  Nasal cannula
at night to maintain O2 sats

# Chronic PAIN:  Pain medications decreased, as above, for
respiratory suppression and sedation.  Patient remained with
controlled pain on decreased methadone to 10mg qid.  Patient
also started on lidocaine patch.

Findings
1. Left large retroperitoneal hematoma with active extravazation
has only
mildly increased in size since the prior exam from 3.5 hours
prior making
large arterial bleed an unlikely possibility. Source of active
extravazation
is likely venous or small arterial lumbar branch. Additionally,
there is
likely a tamponade efffect of the retroperitoneum.
2. Small right retroperitoneal hematoma.
3.  right sup/inf pubic rami fx, right sacral fracture.
Bilateral L5 and left L4 transverse process fractures.
4. Probable grade 1 laceration of the spleen.
5. Simple small pericardial and bilateral pleural effusions.





Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to trauma service on 09//[**4-9**] after a
fall at home.
She has a history of chronic atrial  fibrillation treated with
Coumadin. Upon admission her  INR was 6.0. CT scans from
[**Hospital 1474**] hospital as well as our institution showed a large left
retroperitoneal hematoma and a contrast study showing acute
extravasation. The patient had been generally hemodynamically
stable but has required pressors and several units of packed red
blood cells after admission. She underwent embolization on the
[**2105-9-5**] after arteriography showed a acute contrast
extravasation consistent with bleeding from the left L5 lumbar
artery. This branch was successfully Gelfoam embolized. Her
lateral compression pelvic fracture was complicated by bleeding
but did not require surgical orthopedic management for
stability. Mrs [**Known lastname 24397**] is encouraged to weight bearing as
tolerated and when able with a walker. Orthopedics  will follow
her course and see her as an outpatient 4 weeks after discharge.

We diuresed her with several doses of IV furosemide. Her
breathing and clinical
exam greatly improved. The patient was not able to ambulate in
the hospital yet, but remained stable.
During her hospital stay she was  not anticoagulated with
coumadin, given her recent episode of bleeding. She is receiving
5000 units sq heparin twice daily and is instructed to get in
touch with her PCP as soon as possible to resume her coumadin
therapy. We increased her beta-blocker dose to 50 mg QID.
Her most current hematocrit is 27.9%.

DIAGNOSTICS:

[**2103-5-15**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation is limited by lack of intravenous
contrast, small amount of oral contrast, and streak artifact
from the patient's hands, which are overlying her midabdomen.
Moderate dependent bibasilar atelectasis, and coronary artery
calcifications are unchanged.

Liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and
kidneys remain grossly unremarkable. There is no hydronephrosis.
Stomach and intra- abdominal loops of bowel are unremarkable.
There is no sign of bowel obstruction, or fluid collection to
suggest abscess formation. There is no free air, free fluid, or
abnormal intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Note is made of small
injection granulomas in the anterior lower abdominal wall, some
of which contain small foci of air.

CT PELVIS: Pelvic loops of large and small bowel, and
genitourinary structures remain normal. Foley catheter balloon
is seen within decompressed bladder. There is no free pelvic
fluid or abnormal pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lesions are present.

IMPRESSION: No acute intra-abdominal pathology. No significant
change since [**2103-5-7**].

[**2103-5-15**] RIGHT KNEE XRAY:
IMPRESSION: Small effusion. No evidence of loosening or acute
fracture.

[**2103-5-15**] CXR:
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are low. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. A new right subclavian
catheter is present with tip terminating over the lower SVC.
There is no pneumothorax.

[**2103-5-16**] MRI C-T-Lspine:
FINDINGS: There are degenerative changes seen in the cervical
region with posterior ridging from C3-4 to C5-6 level. There is
no spinal stenosis or extrinsic spinal cord compression seen. At
C6-7, mild degenerative changes noted. Small bilateral
perineural cysts are visualized within the neural foramina.
There is no evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis in the
cervical region. Subtle increased signal is identified between
the spinous processes of C5 and C6 of unclear etiology and could
be degenerative in nature.

Note is made of increased signal of scalenus medius and
posterior muscles bilaterally at the level of C7-T1 which could
indicate focal inflammation of the muscles. Further evaluation
can be obtained with brachial plexus MRI if clinically
indicated.

IMPRESSION:

1. Degenerative changes in the cervical spine without spinal
stenosis or spinal cord compression.

2. Increased signal within bilateral scalene muscles at C7-T1
level could be due to focal muscular inflammation. However, for
better evaluation, brachial plexus MRI can help if clinically
indicated. No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.

THORACIC SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal images of the
thoracic spine were acquired.

FINDINGS: Mild multilevel degenerative changes are seen. No
evidence of spinal cord compression seen. No evidence of marrow
edema or compression fracture noted.

IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes. No evidence of spinal
cord compression, discitis or osteomyelitis.

LUMBAR SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial
images of the lumbar spine were acquired.

FINDINGS: At L1-2, no abnormalities are seen.

From L2-3 and L3-4, mild degenerative disc disease is seen.

At L4-5, there is widening of facet joints noted with fluid
within the facet joints secondary to degenerative change. There
is mild spinal stenosis and moderate bilateral subarticular
recess narrowing seen. There is mild right foraminal narrowing
seen. There is a disc protrusion in the left foramen, which
appears to be deforming the exiting left L4 nerve root.

At L5-S1 level, degenerative disc disease and mild bulging seen.

The distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. The
paraspinal muscles are unremarkable.

There is increased signal identified in the subcutaneous fat in
the upper lumbar region, which could be due to mild edema. No
definite fluid collection is seen.

IMPRESSION:

1. Severe left foraminal narrowing at L4-5 level due to disc
protrusion and facet degenerative changes which could result in
irritation of left L4 nerve root. Mild spinal stenosis and
moderate bilateral subarticular recess narrowing is also seen at
L4-5 level.

2. Mild multilevel degenerative changes at other levels.

3. No evidence of bony metastasis or high-grade thecal sac
compression. No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.

[**2103-5-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation or abscess seen. Normal regional and
global biventricular systolic function. Trace aortic and mitral
regurgitation.

[**2103-5-18**] CT HEAD:
CONCLUSION: No change since [**2103-5-7**]. There is no evidence
of hemorrhage or recent infarction.

[**2103-5-20**] CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Coronary artery calcifications.

[**2103-5-21**] ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Old inferior myocardial infarction. Poor R
wave
progression across the anterior precordial leads. Consider prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2103-5-20**] poor R wave progression is seen across the
precordial leads and the other findings are similar.

[**2103-5-22**]: RIGHT KNEE, THREE VIEWS
There is a large amount of methyl methacrylate in the distal
femur and proximal tibia. There is increased soft tissue density
anterior to the knee joint. The patella abuts the anterior
surface of the methyl methacrylate. A small locule of air is
seen anterior to the distal femur and medial to the knee joint.
Overlying skin staples are present. Relative lucency in the
distal femur anteriorly likely reflects the former site of the
femoral prosthesis. Allowing for background osteopenia and
post-operative changes, no definite evidence of osteomyelitis is
identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is a 64 y.o female with MMP including CAD, CHF, DM,
CKD3, HTN, ETOH cirrhosis, h.o PE, s/p R.TKR who presents with
R.septic knee, [**Last Name (un) **], and hypotension.

#. Sepsis secondary septic R knee: Patient was admitted with
fever, leukocytosis, hypotension (requiring IVF resuscitation
and levophed for less than 24 hrs), and source of infection as
septic R knee (positive tap in ED), s/p instrumentation in the
past.  She has signs of organ dysfunction, mainly ARF.  Pt was
started on vanco/zosyn.  Ortho was consulted and took the
patient to the OR for total knee revision on [**2103-5-18**].  Her
instrumentation was removed and a temporary replacement was
placed.  The arthroplasty was sent for culture, which had no
grown. Tissue from the surgery also had no growth, but all knee
cultures were sent after recieving antibiotics.  She had a TTE
that did not visualize any vegetations though it was suboptimal.
 She also had an MRI of her entire spine to eval for other nidus
of infection/abscess given BUE and RLE pain/weakness.  The MRI
showed no evidence of abscess, diskitis, or osteomyelitis.  She
was continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone which she will
continue for 6 weeks until she sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Infectious
Disease clinic on [**2103-7-2**].  She will need weekly CBC with DIFF,
Chem 7, LFTs, ESR, CRP, and vanco trough levels faxed to
Infectious Disease Fax #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 432**].  The patient will followup
in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic on [**2103-6-5**] for staple removal.  She will
have the hardware replaced in 6 weeks with orthopedics.

# Hypotension:  This was likely secondary to sepsis secondary to
infected R knee joint and this was treated as above.  She had a
cortisol stimulation that was normal.  She was not given
steroids.  Her antihypertensives were initially held, but
restarted prior to discharge.

#Acute Kidney Injury on CKD 3:  Pt's baseline Cr is 1.3-1.6, and
she presented this admission with Cr 3.4. Last admission she had
also presented with Cr 3.4 that resolved to 1.4 after IVF.  Her
CKD is likely secondary to HTN/DM. Acute on chronic renal
failure likely secondary to hypovolemia (pt given 3L in ED) plus
septic physiology.  At the time of discharge, her creatinine was
back to her baseline of 1.3.

# Cardiac:
1.  CAD:  Pt has h.o BMS to RCA in [**2102**].  Pt had presented with
chest pressure that lasted a few minutes.  EKG showed no acute
ischemic changes.  She was ruled out for MI by CEs x3.
Asa/plavix were initially held given OR plans.  BB, [**Last Name (un) **] were
initially held for hypotension.  Prior to discharge, she was
restarted on her cardiac meds.

2. History of chronic diastolic CHF/CMP:  She was initially
volume resuscitated.  She is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in heart
failure clinic.  She will be discharged on her Metoprolol
Succinate, diovan, and her statin as was previously prescribed.
Her lasix is to be used every other day as needed for weight
greater than 195 lbs.

# DM:  Pt was continued on Lantus, HISS.  Her glucose remained
in the 100s with her lantus not requiring sliding scale insulin.


# Pancreatic insufficiency:  Pt was continued on creon TID with
meals.

# Crohn's Disease: The patient is on Asacol as an outpatient.
She is also on Ciprofloxacin 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] chronically.  During her
hospitalization, ciprofloxacin was stopped since the patient is
already on ceftriaxone.  Her ciprofloxacin will be held until
she completes her course of ceftriaxone, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **]
clinic will discuss with the patient's Gastroenterologist
whether this medication should be restarted.

# Chronic neuropathic/radicular pain:  Home long-acting
narcotics were initially held given her somnolence.  She was
continued on topimax, gabapentin, duloxetine.  At the time of
discharge, she was restarted on her Oxycontin at a lower dose of
20 mg TID with oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough pain.  She is
also on standing acetaminophen.  Her Oxycontin can be uptitrated
to 40 mg TID as an outpatient if needed.

Initially, due to her mental status changes, it was thought that
this was likely secondary to narcotics, especially post
operatively.  A head CT did not show any evidence of hemorrhage.
  It was felt that the likely cause of her altered mental status
was the hydromorphone and her sepsis.  Hydromorphone has been
added to her allergy list.

# h/o TIA symptoms:  Neurology was not convinced presentation
was consistent with acute stroke during last admission.  She is
on ASA/plavix for secondary prevention.

The crohns disease and pancreatic insufficieny were stable.  She
is also on Ciprofloxacin 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] chronically. During her
hospitalization, ciprofloxacin was stopped since the patient is
already on ceftriaxone.  Her ciprofloxacin will be held until
she completes her course of ceftriaxone, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **]
clinic will discuss with the patient's Gastroenterologist
whether this medication should be restarted.

83 yo gentleman with little PMHx was admitted from ERCP suite
with history epigastric pain.

He was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 204**] (LGH) 10
days ago with acute on chronic epigastric pain and diagnosed
with pancreatitis. Additional review of systems is notable for
the following: intermittent epigastric pain and anorexia over
last 3-4 months. He denies fevers or jaundice. At LGH, labs were
notable for leukocytosis with WBC >20,000, increasing serum and
fluid amylase levels with serial fluid amylase readings of
[**2156**]-3600s. Imaging was notable for the following: abdominal CT
with peripancreatic and ascitic fluid; MRI which revealed an
amorphous pancreatic head suggestive of hemorrhagic
pancreatitis. A paracentesis was performed on [**2166-4-28**], and fluid
total protein was elevated, a SAAG was near zero, and fluid cell
count revealed WBC 1700 with neutrophilic predominance. For
treatment, he was started empirically on Unasyn on [**2166-4-26**] and
then changed to Zosyn on [**2166-4-29**]. He also had a drain placed
into one of his abdominal fluid collections. Additional issues
include the following:
- malnutrition - He was started on TPN in the setting of being
NPO and with marked hypoalbuminemia with Alb 1.5.
- anemia - He received 1 unit pRBCs.
- Atrial Fibrillation - He developed rapid afib on [**2166-4-29**]. He
was initially started on diltiazem with minimal improvement, and
he was then transitioned to amiodarone.  A pigtail drain was
placed [**2166-5-1**] to drain ascitic fluid.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Assessment for ERCP and possible
transpapillary drainage with stenting.  Finger stick glucose was
elevated to 225 this afternoon.

[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES:
[**2166-5-5**] ERCP
1. Edematous major papilla
2. The bile duct was not dilated. The distal bile duct filled
poorly, most likely due to extrinsic compression from the
pathology at the pancreatic head. No filling defects were noted.

3. Contrast was injected into the pancreatic duct, which
appeared to terminate abruptly in the pancreatic head, with no
filling beyond that point.  This is in keeping with the reported
MRCP findings and is concerning for an obstructing pancreatic
mass.

[**2166-5-6**] Endoscopic Ultrasound
1. A 3.2 cm X 4.1 cm discrete anechoic lesion, consistent with a
cyst was noted in the head of the pancreas.
2. The walls of the cyst were thick measuring 0.22cm.
3. Layering debris was noted in the dependent part of the cyst.
4. A pseudoaneurysm was noted on the lateral wall of the cyst.
5. The cyst appeared to obstruct the main pancreatic duct, which
was dilated distally. The cyst was also noted to compress the
portal vein.
6.  A single perigastric lymph node was noted, which measured
1.8 x 0.8cm.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

[**2166-5-7**] CTA Abd/Pelvis
1. Multiple areas of fluid collection throughout the abdomen
including the
large bilobed pseudocyst above and below the pancreas, in the
right paracolic gutter, transverse mesentery, and within
anterior abdominal wall.
2. 6-mm pseudoaneurysm located within the pseudocyst at the
level of the
pancreas. There is also a 10-mm aneurysm at the origin of the
common hepatic artery.
3. Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct due to compressive
effect of the
pseudocyst.



Brief Hospital Course:
83yo male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid
collections thought related to his pseudocyst. His course was
complicated by unexplained PEA arrest. The patient had an ICU
course s/p resuscitation wherein he did not regain mental
faculties or responsiveness. His family chose comfort measures
and Mr. [**Known lastname 59996**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2166-5-19**].

# PEA arrest - unclear precipitant. Patient never regained
mental faculties.

1. Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
Collections
On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect,
suggestive of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS
which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was
also performed, which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also
noted multiple large abdominal fluid collections. He was
evaluated by our general surgery team, who thought his abdominal
process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation was
relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage
at this time was not indicated. He developed a bleeding GDA
aneurysm and was taken to IR for embolization before which he
developed PEA arrest. This GDA was ultimately embolized.

2. Clostridium difficile infection
Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased
diarrhea and marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff
positive and started on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his
diarrhea. He was recommended to continue flagyl for 2 weeks from
4/7-20/10.

3. Hepatic Cirrhosis
Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis,
although patient has no history of this in the past.

4. Atrial Fibrillation
Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and
was started on diltiazem before being transitioned to
amiodarone. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his PICC line was noted to
be advanced into the right atrium, and it was thought that this
may have been triggering his atrial fibrillation. During his
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], he remained in sinus rhythm and with
excellent rate control. His amiodarone was discontinued.

5. Acute Renal Failure
During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as
1.9 and then remained stable between .[**8-31**].

6. Malnutrition
Patient was started on TPN at the OSH and was continued on this
during his hospitalization. He was NPO during this
hospitalization and was NPO on discharge. At rehab, we recommend
that he remain NPO for the first week. He could take sips for
comfort after this time.

7. Anemia
Unknown baseline. His hematocrit has remained stable during this
admission from 27-30.

8. Hyperglycemia
He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 25354**] and was continued on insulin during his
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2172-4-21**]: S/p Left temporal-parietal crani for tumor resection


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 97968**] is a 66 year-old male with a history of lung
cancer, a left internal capsule stroke and left temporal grade
III infiltrating astrocytoma presented to the emergency room
this afternoon with multiple complaints. He is lethargic and
aphasic - history obtained primarily from his daughter who
accompanied him to the emergency room. Briefly he was diagnosed
with two seperate primaries last year (lung adenocarcinoma
treated with a lobectomy and an astrocytoma). He was on high
dose steroid therapy to reduce the cerebral edema and developed
a myopathy which prompted the gradual tapering of his steroids.
He was recently enrolled in the Xerecept clinical trial and his
decadron dose was reduced from 12mg qd down to 6 mg qd. His
daughter notes that since the reduction of the steroids he has
had become increasingly lethargic and fatigued. In addition, she
notes that over the past 24 hours he has had several episodes of
urinary incontinence and emesis. She also notes he has had
increasing difficulty walking and performing his basic tasks.
His daughter reports that he has been drinking but has had a
decreased appetite over the past 48 hours.

Review of Systems: Pt not able to provide. He was recently
diagnosed with a right lower extremity DVT for which he was
started on lovenox therapy. Accoring to his daughter no chest
pain, shortness of breath or syncopal episodes today. She feels
the swelling in the lower leg is mildly improved todya on exam.

ER course - CT of head demonstrated increasing midline shift
leftward from the MRI done in [**2172-2-20**]; worsening edema; mass
effect on left ventricle; displacement of ipsilateral lateral
ventricle although degree of herniation has increased;
progressive left peduncle herniation. Pt discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
and given dose of Dexadron (10 mg IV).

CT HEAD ([**2172-4-20**]):
1. Worsening vasogenic edema and midline shift (subfalcine
heriation) secondary to large known GBM. There is similar
effacement of the ipsilateral lateral ventrical, although the
degree of subfalcine herniation has increased.
2. There is increased sulcal effacement of the suprasellar
cistern and ambient cisterns on the left, indicating progressive
left uncal herniation with early transtentorial migration.
3. Hypodensity within the left cerebral peduncle, likely
corresponds to signal abnormality noted on MRI from [**2172-3-16**].

MRI BRAIN ([**2172-4-20**]):
New left to right subfalcine and left uncal herniation
associated with a dramatic increase in peritumoral edema
surrounding a left temporal lobe lesion. The lesion itself is
only slightly increased in size. Slow diffusion in small focal
areas in this lesion suggests infarction. However, focal areas
of necrosis may produce this effect. Enhancement and FLAIR
signal hyperintensity along the sulci in the left cerebral
hemisphere are concerning for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
This finding makes associated radiation necrosis less likely. If
clinically indicated, MR perfusion and Spectroscopy imaging
could be performed.

CTX ([**2172-4-20**]):
Increase in the right pleural effusion and/or adjacent
atelectasis. Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the post-surgery
chest.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Astrocytoma:
The CT of his demonstrated increasing midline shift along with
increasing edema likely accounting for the majority of his
symptoms.  Steroid dose had been tapered recently given the
patient's steroid myopathy.  Given this, he was given 10 mg IV
decadrom in the emergency room with continuation of IV steroids
thereafter.

He was seen by neurosurgery and taken to the OR on [**2172-4-21**] for
left temporal craniotomy for tumor debulking.  There were no
intraoperative or postoperative complications.  The patient was
taken to the trauma ICU overnight for close monitoring of his
neuro status and blood pressure.  PRN hydralazine was used to
keep SBP<140.  A repeat CT showed ""interval decompression and
improvement in the amount of mass effect, midline shift,
subfalcine herniation, and effacement of the left suprasellar
and ambient cisterns"" and the patient remained without headache
or nausea/vomiting.  His speach aphasic and his right-sided
weakness was stable to mildly improved.  He was seen by physical
and occupational therapy and they felt he would benefit from
rehab.

At the time of discharge, the plan was for:
- Continued dexamethasone, with taper
- Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] on [**5-5**] for chemotherapy
- Monitoring of mental status
- Metoprolol was started for blood pressure control

2. Steroid Myopathy:
Patient had a history of steroid induced myopathy and had
presented with an ongoing steroid taper.  Given the amount of
edema seen and the symptoms secondary to this, steroids were
increased at the time of admission and were continued; upon
discharge, plan was for a steroid taper.  As above, both PT and
OT were consulted.

3. DVT:
Patient had recent history of DVT, diagnosed [**2172-4-14**].  Presented
on daily lovenox, which was held before surgery.
Post-operatively, the lovenox was held for two days and resumed
on discharge.

4. Lung cancer:
Was status-post lobectomry.  This issue was stable during
admission.

.
This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a
speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these
guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you
otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any
questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.
.
ACTIVITY:
.
There are restrictions on activity. On the side of your
amputation you are non weight bearing until cleared by your
Surgeon. You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever
possible.
.
You may use the other leg to assist in transferring and pivots.
But try not to exert to much pressure on the amputation site
when transferring and or pivoting. Please keep knee immobilizer
on at all times to help keep the amputation site straight.
.
No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.
.
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
.
Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s) .
.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.
.
Exercise:
.
Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.
.
Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon.
.
Try to keep leg elevated when able.
.
BATHING/SHOWERING:
.
You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A
dressing may cover you??????re amputation site and this should be
left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and
wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have
sutures, which are usually removed in 3 weeks. This will be done
by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment.
.
WOUND CARE:
.
An appointment will be made for you to return for suture
removal.
.
When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm
water and soap in the shower.
.
Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for
four weeks after surgery.
.
MEDICATIONS:
.
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the
medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a
new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every
three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.
.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small
balanced meals throughout the day.
.
CAUTIONS:
.
NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you
smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.
.
Avoid pressure to your amputation site.
.
No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery.
.
DIET :
.
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent
meals may be preferred.
.
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's
permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred
or get a referral from your doctor.
.
If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight
management program. Your health and its improvement depend on
it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be
easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new
attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get
a referral from your doctor.
.
If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may
request a referral from your doctor.
.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:
.
Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your
improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the
chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood
pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to
the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!
.
Please call the office on the first working day after your
discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This
should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days
after discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5:30 Monday
through Friday.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 year old male with past medical history significant
for CAB s/p CABG in [**2111**] (LIMA-LAD and SVG-OM), dyslipidemia,
peripheral vascular disease (s/p multiple stents to bilateral
iliacs, femoral), hypertension, s/p CVA, left carotic artery
occlusion who presents with crescendo shortness of breath and
chest pressure.  Three days prior to admission, the patient was
awakened from sleep short of breath, diaphoretic, and with 3/10
chest pressure radiating to both shoulders.  These symptoms
resolved upon sitting up.  Similar episodes ocurred more
frequently over the next few days, and the patient decided to
seek medical attention.  He denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, lower extremity edema, increased abdominal girth.  He has
been sleeping with 2 pillows, which is unchanged.  At baseline,
the patient is able to walk without shortness of breath or chest
pressure.  At the OSH ED, he was noted to be hypertensive and
mildly hypoxic.  CXR showed mild to moderate CHF/pulmonary
edema.  Initial EKG was NSR, 92BPM, slight ST depression
inferolaterally.  Initial troponin was .309.  Repeat troponin 8
hours later was 3.07 with CPK of 159.  Repeat EKG revealed
inverted T waves across the precordium.  He was given Lasix and
nitroglycerin with complete symptom relief.  Despite improvement
in cardiac symptoms, the patient experienced black heme positive
stools with a HCT drop from 31.7 to 25.  He received 2 units
PRBC.  The GI service was consulted who deferred endoscopy until
completion of cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
* CAD: In light of significant family history, other cardiac
risk factors, known CAD s/p CABG, crescendo shortness of breath
and chest pressure, positive troponin, and EKG changes, the
patient was sent to cardiac catheterization.  His cardiac
catherization demonstrated a right dominant system with 80%
stenosis of the LMCA distally, bilateral 60% renal artery
re-stenoses along with a diffuse 40% occlusion of his left
subclavian resulting in 50 mmHg drop in his peripheral blood
pressures compared to his central blood pressure.  He also had
an elevated PCWP of 35 mm Hg. He was thus admitted to the CCU
for agressive blood pressure management and diuresis with lasix
and niseritide.  On return to the floor, the patient continued
to have poorly controlled hypertension and recurrent congestive
heart failure exacerbations.  Lasix and niseritide were employed
again with good effect.  After several family meetings to
explain the [**Hospital 228**] medical status to both the patient himself
and his family, the patient agreed to accept home oxygen
supplementation in light of his tenous fluid status.  He will be
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks to discuss renal MRA and
possible vascular intervention because it was not possible to
accurately assess the patient's renal arteries with ultrasound.


* HYPERTENSION: The patient had difficult to control
hypertension as documented above.  The patient was discharged on
maximal doses of blood pressure medications with the exception
of starting an ace-inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **] in light of his poor renal
function secondary to renal artery stenosis.  The patient's
underlying etiology of hypertension is unclear but likely
related to renal artery stenosis.  This issue will be addressed
as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 14966**], the patient's
cardiologists.

* PUMP: The patient had a cardiac echo which demonstrated an EF
of 60-65% and a moderately dilated atrium.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed severely elevated left and right sided
filling pressures which were indicative of the congestive heart
failure described above.

* RHYTHM: The patient had no episodes of arrythmias.

* GI BLEED/ANEMIA: The patient reportedly had a Hct drop from 35
to 27.5 at the OSH.  There was no evidence of GI bleeding at
this hospital.  Further analysis of the patient's Hct over the
last few years reveals a chronic anemia.  The patient was
transfused a total of 4 units while in the unit and just prior
to discharge.  In the long term, it may be considered to send
the patient for colonoscopy or endoscopy to evaluate for GI
pathology that could account for chronic slow bleeding.  With
respect to etiology of the patient's chronic anemia, iron
studies are pending at the time of this discharge summary.

* ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: After his cardiac
catherization the patient's creatinine rose to a peak of 3.8
from his admission creatinine 1.8.  With aggressive diuresis,
the patient's dye nephropathy resolved and creatinine returned
to his baseline of 1.6 prior to discharge.  The patient did not
require hemodialysis.

* CODE: DNR/DNI.  This status was confirmed with the patient,
his son, and his daughter.

Chief Complaint:
headache, syncope, generalized seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy (twice) for BAL.
TEE
Evacuation of left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a mechanical mitral
valve, on coumadin, and hypertension.  On [**2147-7-14**], he awoke
feeling generally unwell.  His wife called EMS and - en route to
[**Name (NI) **] Hospital - the patient had a generalized convulsion.
The patient had a second generalized convulsion upon entry to
the [**Location (un) **] ER, he developed a massive tongue hematoma from a
tongue bite, and underwent a difficult and prolonged intubation
process.  INR was 3.2, which was in the appropriate range given
the mechanical valve.  NCHCT revealed ICH and SAH.  He was
loaded with 1 gram of dilantin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

At [**Hospital1 18**], CTA revealed left sylvian fissure subarachnoid
hemorrhage extending
to parietal sulci, 4-mm aneurysm at the left MCA bifurcation
pointing laterally, 2 to 2.5 mm aneurysm arising from the A2
segment of the left anterior cerebral artery at the level of
ventricular bodies.  In the ED,
the patient received Factor 9 and 1 unit FFP. He subsequently
received 6 units of platelets and FFP to reverse his
coagulopathy. He was started on nimodipine and HOB was kept > 30
degrees.

A subsequent conventional angiogram further delineated the
aneurysms; the Neurosurgery team felt that these aneurysms were
unlikely to be the cause of the patient??????s bleeding.  Since there
would be no further surgical intervention, the patient was
transferred to the Neurology team in the ICU.

IMAGING:

Admssion CTA CNS:
1. Left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhage extending to
parietal sulci.
2. 4-mm aneurysm at the left MCA bifurcation pointing laterally.

3. 2 to 2.5 mm aneurysm arising from the A2 segment of the left
anterior
cerebral artery at the level of ventricular bodies.
.
CT head [**2147-8-8**]: No evidence of acute new hemorrhage. Area of
prior hemorrhage in the left subinsular region is less apparent.
.
MRI/A: CNS:
1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left Sylvian
fissure
and left occipital lobe with left temporal lobe hemorrhage,
magnetic
susceptibility change is also noted on the left frontal lobe,
raising the
possibility of chronic hemorrhage or microbleed (5:16), residual

intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. The previously noted aneurysms on the left ACA and left MCA
are not
clearly identified in this examination.
3. Sequela of a prior infarction is noted on the right
cerebellar hemisphere.
4. Restricted diffusion is noted on the left parietal lobe
likely consistent with subacute ischemic changes, measuring
approximately 6 x 7 mm.

Cerebral arteriography:
2-mm aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the origin
of the anterior temporal branch.
This was thought not to be responsible for his left sylvian
fissure hemorrhage as there was no history of headache at onset
and the
hemorrhage itself was located remote from the aneurysm and there
was no blood in the basal cisterns at all.
A second aneurysm measuring 1.5-2 mm was also located in the
left pericallosal artery. The A1 was dominant on the left side
.
TTE: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild
regional systolic dysfunction. Normal functioning aortic
bileaflet prosthesis. At least mild mitral regurgitation
.
Carotid dupplex showed:  Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA
stenosis <40%
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis;
1. Large 7 x 9 x 18 cm measuring retroperitoneal hematoma in the
iliopsoas
and iliacus muscle
2. Pleural calcifications consistent with asbestos exposure and
atelectasis in
bilateral lungs with round atelectasis in the right lower lobe
3. Gastric pull-up is visualized status post esophagectomy for
esophageal
cancer.
.
RUQ U/S: Slight increased echogenicity in the liver. More
advanced forms
of liver disease such as fibrosis / cirrhosis not excluded.
Otherwise normal right upper quadrant ultrasound without
evidence of biliary abnormality.
.
L knee X-ray [**2147-8-8**]:
 Probable undisplaced tibial fracture, with a large joint
effusion
presumably representing hemarthrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. mental status/neuro exam: The patient's baseline is oriented
to place, occasionally date (usually knows [**2146**], not month). He
has bizarre/tangential speech at times, and becomes temporarily
confused. He has 5/5 strength in upper extremities, 4-/5 in
lower extremities at both proximal and distal muscles, thought
to be secondary to deconditioning and ICU myopathy (not due to
stroke). He has 2+ reflexes on right, 1+ on left. Upgoing
Babinski on right.
.
#. seizures:
The patient presented after generalized seizures, complicated by
tongue biting and hematoma. Head CT showed left-sided
intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage.   It was unknown
whether bleeding was the precipitating event, followed by
seizure due to parenchymal irritation; or, if seizure occurred
initially and trauma sustained during the convulsion led to
bleeding. The patient was loaded with Dilantin and then
initiated on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis since this does not
interact with coumadin. He had no further seizure activity int
he ICU. After transfer to the medical floor, the patient had an
episode of lower extremity shaking while asleep in a chair,
witnessed only by wife. This was thought unlikely to represent
seizure activity, and more likely myoclonic jerks during sleep.
Neurology was called to see patient at this time. 20 minute EEG
was done, showing no epileptiform activity. The patient will
continue on Keppra for at least 6 months. He will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in neurology.
.
#. ICH:
The patient underwent a conventional angiogram which did show
2-mm aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the origin
of the anterior temporal branch. However, this was thought not
to be responsible for his left sylvian fissure hemorrhage as
there was no history of headache at onset and the
hemorrhage itself was located remote from the aneurysm and there
was no blood in the basal cisterns at all. He did have an
intraparenchimal bleed with a SAH component that may have been
due to amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds in GRE. These added to
his age and PV white matter disease placed him at a higher risk
for a new bleed. However, he needed to remain anticoagulated
because of his mechanical valve. Thoracic surgery was consulted
about the possibility of pursuing a valve replacement for a
biological prosthesis to avoid anticoagulation. However, the
surgical risk was determined to outweigh the benefit of avoiding
anticoagulation. The patient remained off anticoagulation due to
this high risk. On [**7-18**], the patient developed new right-sided
weakness and MRI showed new left MCA infarct. This was thought
to have originated from AVR thromboembolization. Heparin was
resumed for goal PTT 40-60 and coumadin was resumed [**8-1**]. Several
repeat head CT have all been stable, most recent [**2147-8-8**].
Heparin infusion was stopped once a therapeutic INR was reached
on warfarin.
.
#. Retroperitoneal Bleed:
After the patient had a stroke off anticoagulation, heparin was
resumed.  Shortly after, the patient developed worsening anemia
with HCT eventually falling to 19.  He received a total of 15
units pRBCs during the hospital course.  His systolic blood
pressure dropped to the 80s and he became tachycardic.  A CT
abd/pelvis revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma.  He
required very aggressive transfusion of RBCs and underwent
evacuation of hematoma by vascular surgery on [**7-27**].  He
tolerated the procedure well and hematocrit has been stable
since the procedure.  His heparin was resumed with goal PTT
40-60 on [**7-30**] and was restarted on coumadin [**8-1**].
.
The patient was transferred to the neuromedicine step-down
service on [**8-1**].  He was noted to have intermittant fevers.  CT
of the torso and head did not reveal any new source. He became
hypotensive and Hct continued to decrease. EKG was concerning
for new T wave inversions and a stat ECHO showed possible
anterior wall motion abnormality, most likely intracranial T
waves.  The patient responded to IV fluids and placement in
trendelenberg.  This event was presumed to be due to continued
retroperitoneal bleeding. Anticoagulation was again held
temporarily.
The patient was eventually safely anticoagulated and INR was 3.0
on day of discharge. The patient's coumadin was being held for
supratherapeutic INR prior to discharge. PT and PTT are
elevated, likely due to poor nutritional status. INR will need
to be monitored daily and coumadin adjusted appropriately to
maintain goal range 2.5-3.5.  He should have daily INR checks
and adjustment of dose to maintain INR 2.5-3.5.  At the time of
discharge, he was restarted on coumadin 4.0 mg daily.
His hematocrit is currently 27.9 and stable.

#. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to a large
tongue hematoma.  On [**7-24**] (after extubation) he was found to
have increased respiration rate and work of breathing.  He had a
clot removed from his trachea by ENT with moderate resolution of
symptoms.  He is currently doing well on room air.

#. Ventilator-associated PNA: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
also complicated by persistent fevers and leukocytosis secondary
to pneumonia while intubated. He underwent 2 bronchoscopies with
BAL and samples grew klebsiella, serratia, and staph aureus.  He
completed a 12-day course of antibiotics, initially started on
vancomycin and cefepime.  He is currently afebrile with no
leukocytosis.

#. Gout: The patient developed erythema, swelling and pain of
the left 1st MTP joint, consistent with gout. He has a prior
history of gout, so no joint aspiration was done. The patient
responded well to colchicine with reduced pain and inflammation.

#. Left knee trauma: The patient fell from bed in MICU. X-ray
showed possible small nondisplaced tibial fracture, but unable
to see joint line. The patient was weight bearing well with PT.

#. HTN: The patient was continued on metoprolol and Imdur.

#. Code status: DNR

heart rates in the 120s to 140s.  The patient had a troponin
peak of 6.4.  The patient was to be cardioverted, but self
q6h was started.  The patient was evaluated by
gastrointestinal who thought that the upper bleed was due to
NSAID use.  The patient was on Celebrex at home for arthritis
and degenerative joint disease and recently had increased a
dose from qd to [**Hospital1 **].  Gastroenterologists have decided not to
scope the patient given her age and comorbidities, unless she
becomes hemodynamically unstable in the future.  The patient
has been managed with q8h hematocrit checks and Protonix 40
mg.  MICU course was also complicated by decreased oxygen
saturations to the high 80s that was thought to be due to CSF
exacerbation.  The patient has been gently diuresed with
Lasix and is now saturating in the 90s on room air.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN - THE PATIENT GETS A RASH.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Location (un) 5481**] [**Hospital3 **] Environment with 24 hour home health aide care.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.3, hematocrit
33.9; of note, hematocrit has remained stable during this
entire admission after transfusions, platelets 211.  PT 12.4,
PTT 24, INR 1.1.  Sodium 149, potassium 4.3, chloride 114,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 75, creatinine 1, platelets 146, calcium
9.9, phosphate 1.7, magnesium 2.7.  [**7-19**]:  Troponin 3.8

IMAGING:  Admission electrocardiogram revealed new ST segment
depressions in inferior and lateral leads, 2, F, V4, V5, V6
at 117 beats per minute, variable P-wave morphology, notched
P-waves.  Chest x-ray revealed bilateral effusions, linear
atelectasis at left mid lung zone.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 100, respiratory rate 20, blood
pressure 132/64, oxygen saturation 99% on 40% face mask.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  No jugular venous
distention, no murmur.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Extraocular muscles intact.
LUNGS:  Positive crackles at bases bilaterally, right greater
than left.  Decreased breath sounds at bases bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman
with a history of congestive heart failure, dementia,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, degenerative joint disease
and arthritis who presents with upper gastrointestinal bleed
thought secondary to NSAID use who is now status post 4 units
of packed red blood cell transfusions.  MICU course is
complicated by atrial flutter and a troponin of 6.4.  The
patient's hematocrit was checked q8h and then [**Hospital1 **] during this
hospitalization.  Hematocrit has remained stable.  The
patient was followed by gastrointestinal who felt that the
patient did not need to be scoped at this time and should be
followed up as an outpatient if she has any other symptoms of
gastrointestinal bleeding.  During this hospitalization, the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by congestive heart
failure exacerbation due to the 4 units of packed red blood
cells.  The patient was diuresed with Lasix.  The patient is
currently on room air and will resume her outpatient Lasix
dose of 100 mg po q day.  The patient's troponin has
decreased while in house.  Most likely, the patient had a non
Q-wave myocardial infarction with atrial flutter.  The
patient is not a good candidate for aspirin because of her
upper gastrointestinal bleed.  Will continue Lopressor 12.5
mg [**Hospital1 **] and captopril 50 mg tid.  In terms of the patient's
anemia, the patient has normal renal function and will not be
discharged with Epogen injections.  The patient will get iron
and vitamin C as an outpatient.  The patient may need
occasional hematocrit checks in the future.

History of Present Illness:
47 yo female w/ h/o bipolar d/o, schizophrenia and DM2, who
presents to the ED from [**Hospital1 1680**]-HRI with progressively worsening
mental status and tremulousness, found to have a lithium level
of 3.5. History was obtained by patient's nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1680**]-HRI.
At some point in [**Name (NI) 205**], pt's clozapine was discontinued due to
agranulocytosis. This resulted in an acute psychotic episode,
requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital1 1680**]-HRI on [**6-22**]. She has been
hospitalized at this facility for the past 5 weeks. Her nurse
notes that over the first 2-3 weeks of her hospitalization, she
steadily became more psychotic and paranoid, believing that she
was being poisoned. For the past 3 weeks, pt. has had very poor
PO intake. Per her nurse, she did not have any nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, SOB, cough, chest pain, fevers, or
dysuria. Of note, a full set of basic labs were obtained on
[**7-18**]. These were all wnl, including a BUN/Cr of 24/0.8. She was
started on lithium 300mg TID on [**7-23**]. Over the past week, staff
have noted that she has been increasingly tremulous and unsteady
on her feet, requiring a walker to ambulate. Over the past two
days, pt. became increaisngly confused and incoherent. She was
refusing to get out of bed and being more agitated. A lithium
level was checked and was 3.5. This prompted transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: 100.2 120 115/92 18 97%
Labs were notable for Lithium level of 3.0. Na 133 K 5.5 Cl 101

Pt. was noted to be very tremulous and agitated. A temporary HD
line was placed in the ED. For her agitation, she was given a
total of 4mg of Ativan, and was transfered to the MICU for HD
and further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77651**] is a 47 y/o female with a h/o schizophrenia,
bipolar, DM, and hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
altered mental status and tremulous and was found to have
lithium toxicity, [**Last Name (un) **], and streptococcus viridans in bacteremia.

Acute Issues:
# Lithium Toxicity: The patient was found to ahve a Lithium
level of 3.0 on arrival. It is unlikely that this represents an
overdose as patient has been an inpatient at a psychiatric
hospital. She has only been on lithium for approximately 1 week.
It is likely that patient sustained an acute kidney injury over
the course of the past few weeks, causing decreased renal
lithium clearance, resulting in toxicicty. Toxicology and renal
were consulted. Temporary femoral HD line was placed, and she
was dialyzed x 1 session. Lithium level was checked 6 hours
after dialysis and was 1.0, re-check was 1.2, then came down to
0.9 as UOP picked up. Her lithium level decreased again to 0.7
and then to < 0.2.

# Acute Renal Failure: The patient was found to have a Cr of 3.3
on presentation (baseline was 0.8 on [**2138-7-18**]). This was likely
pre-renal [**12-26**] poor po intake over past few weeks. She received
2L boluses of NS and had maintenance fluids of NS at 200-250cc.
Her UOP increased significantly with aggressive hydration and
her creatinine returned to her baseline of 0.8.

# Streptococcus Viridans bacteremia: The patient was found to
have strep viridans present in [**11-25**] bottles. The patient was
initially started on Vancomycin and it was thought that the gram
positive cocci represented a contamination. Upon speciation of
strep viridans, Infectious Disease was consulted. They
considered this a low risk bacteremia and recommended 14 days of
ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily from negative cultures. Repeat cultures
on [**2138-7-30**] were with no growth. The temporary hemodialysis
catheter tip was sent for culture on [**7-31**] and was with no growth.
A midline was placed on [**2138-8-2**] for antibiotic administration and
antibiotics will be completed on [**2138-8-14**].

# AMS/Psychosis: Improved somewhat after dialysis and
normalization of lithium level. Agitation was generally well
controlled with PRN Ativan. Continued to be agitated and
responding to internal stimuli. Her antipsychotics were
initially held in setting of acute lithium toxicity due to
increased risk of NMS. Psych was consulted and followed patient.
They recommended re-starting her aripiprazole and it was slowly
titrated back to home dose of 30 mg daily. She was discharged to
inpatient psych bed on [**Hospital1 **] 4.

Chronic:
# Schizophrenia/Bioplar: Psych was consulted and followed
patient. Initially all psych meds were held in the setting of
acute lithium toxicity. Her aripriprazole was started back and
slowly titrated back to home dose. The remainder of psych meds
were held. She was discharged to inpatient psych bed on [**Hospital1 **] 4.

#DM2: The patient's home metformin was held during
hospitalization and she was maintained on insulin sliding scale.

#Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH was within normal limits. Her
home synthroid was continued during hospitalization and cytomel
will be restarted upon discharge.

Transitional Issues:
-Will need to complete 14 day course of ceftriaxone with 9/6
conuted as day 1 (to be completed on [**8-14**]).
-Psychiatry to continue titrating and adjust psychiatric
medicaitons.
-Patient will need to restart metformin when not refusing to
eat.
- patient will need Panorex and/or Dental eval for multiple
caries when acute psychosis improves as possible source for her
bacteremia

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Atrial mass.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37-year old
female with a right atrial mass that was found on
echocardiogram.  The patient was hospitalized in [**Month (only) 958**] of
this year for an asthma exacerbation.  The patient underwent
an echocardiogram to follow up for a high-dose steroid use.
The echocardiogram revealed a right atrial mass.  The patient
had reported six to seven weeks of a low-grade fever with a
temperature of 99 to 100.  The patient was placed on Ceftin
for a positive urinary tract infection, and since then she
has had no fevers.  The patient reportedly had received 125
mg of Solu-Medrol two days prior to admission for an asthma
exacerbation.  The patient's Perm-A-Cath (through which she
was receiving gamma globulin) was discontinued under local
anesthetic on Friday - three days prior to admission.  She
complained of no pain since that time.

The patient had an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year with
an ejection fraction of 65 percent and a right atrial mass of
2 cm x 2 cm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a significant history
of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypertension, morbid obesity, degenerative disc disease,
systemic lupus erythematosus, sleep apnea, hypoglycemia, skin
cancer, renal calculi, steroid-induced myopathy of the spine,
and rheumatoid arthritis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother is alive at the age of 67.  Father
died at the age of 51 - killed in a motor vehicle accident.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking or the use of
alcohol.  The patient is disabled and lives with her husband.
The denies the use of cocaine or marijuana.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
temperature was 99.3, her pulse was 86, her blood pressure
was 138/78, respiratory rate was 18, and she was saturating
96 percent on room air.  The patient was generally obese,
alert, and oriented.  The patient had no obvious lesions on
the skin.  The patient's pupils equal, round and reactive to
light.  The extraocular movements were intact.  The sclerae
were anicteric.  The eyes were not injected.  There were no
bruits heard.  There was no jugular venous distention on the
neck.  There was no lymphadenopathy.  The patient's lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The patient had a
well-healed right Port-A-Cath site.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed first heart sounds and second heart
sounds heard.  A regular rate and rhythm.  There were no
murmurs.  The patient's abdomen was obese and healed.  The
extremities were warm and well perfused.  There was no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The patient's neurologic
examination was grossly intact.  The patient had good 2 plus
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and 1 plus posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
hospital and underwent a repeat urinalysis and complete blood
count.

The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Service and
an evaluation for low-grade fever prior to her surgery.  The
patient had a repeat urinalysis and straight catheter
urinalysis recommended by Infectious Disease.  We obtained a
consultation from them, who felt that the patient did not
have a urinary tract infection and that there was no need for
her to continue antibiotic coverage.  Thus, from that
standpoint, was able to go to the operating room.  The repeat
urinalysis was negative with the straight catheterization.
The patient's white blood cell count was 13.5 preoperatively;
however, the patient had Solu-Medrol three days prior.  Thus,
this was not a concern.  Infectious Disease recommended that
the patient may go to the operating room without antibiotics.

The patient underwent a right atrial removal.  On
postoperative day one, the patient was extubated.  She
remained neurologically intact and remained in a sinus rhythm
with good pressure without any clips.  The patient was
saturating 97 percent on 2 liters.  She was able to take
clears without any difficulties.  She had a low-grade
temperature of 100.1, but this temperature defervesced.  The
patient's creatinine was 0.6.  Otherwise, she was doing well.
The patient's chest tubes were removed due to low chest tube
output, and she was advanced to a cardiac diet.

On postoperative day two, the patient was doing well.  The
patient was on the floor.  She was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  The patient was put on Toradol for pain management.
There were no major issues.

On postoperative day three, the patient remained afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was put back on her
home medication and was given Dilaudid and Motrin for pain
management and was discharged home.

History of Present Illness:
35F with a h/o active IV drug abuse who presented to an OSH ED
c/o jaundice and abdominal pain on [**2113-3-6**], found to have and
ultimately transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**2113-3-10**] for ERCP.  Ms.
[**Last Name (un) 110632**] reports noticing RUQ pain intermittently for the
past three months, but it had not become bad enough for her to
seek medical attention.  When she also developed jaundice
associated
with generalized malaise and myalgias, she presented to the
[**Hospital3 **] ED, where she was found to have elevated LFTS (TB
9.6, DB 6.6, alb 3.6, AST 638, ALT 640, AP 615, and WBC 13.6),
and cholelithiasis without ductal dilation on ultrasound.
Hepatitis C titer was positive.  She was admitted for further
work-up.
When MRCP on [**1-/2030**] revealed cholelithiasis, possible
cholecystitis, and cystic duct stones without CBD or IHD
dilation, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2113-3-10**] for ERCP.
ERCP revealed a laceration of the major papilla suggestive of
recent stone passage, and stones were noted in the lower CBD
with an impacted stone at the ampulla.  Sphincterotomy and stone
extraction were performed, but subsequent cholangiography
revealed constrast extravasation suggesting perforation.  Two
biliary stents and an NGT were placed, and arrangement for
direct admission to the West 2A Surgery service was made.

[**2113-3-12**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal free air.
A large
amount of fluid in the right anterior and posterior pararenal
spaces tracking down to the lower quadrant of the abdomen. No
obvious leak of contrast to identify the site of perforation. If
needed a delayed non-contrast CT abdomen can be obtained to
assess for a delayed leak.
2. Small amount of pneumomediastinum.
3. A small simple right pleural effusion with right basilar
atelectasis.

[**2113-3-16**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Decreased but persistent large intraperitoneal and
retroperitoneal free
air. A large amount of fluid in the right retroperitoneum is
seen with
anterior displacement of the right kidney. No rim-enhancing
fluid collection is seen.
2. Decreased pneumomediastinum.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis as
described above.

[**2113-3-20**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Improvement in right lower lobe consolidation and decrease in
right
pleural effusion.
2. Slight decrease in fluid component of right perinephric
collection at site of Drain. Extensive multiloculated
phlegmonous change with no significant large fluid component to
target for drainage.
3. No new collections are identified.
4. Persistent extensive free intra-abdominal air with multiple
pockets of air surrounding the second part of duodenum, likely
at site of duodenal
perforation.

[**2113-3-29**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in size of loculated gas-fluid collections with four
drains in
place. There are small pockets of loculated collections that may
not be
adequately drained. Significant resolution of intra-abdominal
free air.
2. Right hydronephrosis likely from obstruction of ureter due to
surrounding inflammation.
3. Slight improvement in right lower lobe consolidation;
however, slight
increase in right pleural effusion.

[**2113-3-31**] RENAL US:
FINDINGS:
1. There is stable mild hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
Adjacent to the lower pole, is a partially imaged complex fluid
collection containing a drain. The right kidney measures
approximately 14 cm.
2. The left kidney measures approximately 14.2 cm. There is no
hydronephrosis, renal lesion or nephrolithiasis.
3. The bladder is minimally distended limiting evaluation and
grossly
unremarkable.

[**2113-4-6**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to lack of intravenous and oral contrast
demonstrates an interval decrease in the phlegmonous collection
in the right perinephric space now measuring 8.0 x 3.0 cm with a
drain in place. Multiple adjacent collections with air and fluid
are again noted and appear relatively stable to minimally
decreased in size. Three of the previously visualized drains
have since been removed.
2. Continued mild right hydronephrosis.
3. Resolution of right pleural effusion. Right lower lobe
opactiy has
decreased in size.
4. Two common bile duct stents are in place with pneumobilia.
5. 2-mm non-obstructive left renal stone.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service with
duodenal perforation status post ERCP. The patient was made NPO
with NGT, started on IV fluids and IV Zosyn, and Dilaudid PCA
for pain control. CT scan on HD # 2 demonstrated large amount of
fluid in the right anterior and posterior pararenal spaces
tracking down to the lower quadrant of the abdomen and large
amount of free air. Nutritional consult was called for TPN
recommendations and PICC line was placed. The patient continued
to spike low grade fever and her blood cultures were positive
for STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS, Vancomycin Iv was added on HD #
6. Repeat abdominal CT demonstrated  decreased but persistent
large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal free  air with a large
amount of fluid in the right retroperitoneum is seen with
anterior displacement of the right kidney. The patient continued
to spike fever and IR drainage of the right retroperitoneal
fluid collection was ordered. The patient underwent CT-guided
percutaneous drainage catheter placement into the right
perinephric space on HD # 6 and fluid was sent for cultures. The
patient's diet was advanced as tolerated on POD # 8, and was
well tolerated. The cultures were positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans
and IV Fluconazole was added. Despite antibiotics treatment
patient continued to spike fever and her abdominal pain was
continued to be significantly high requiring large amount of IV
Dilaudid, Ativan and Ketorolac to manage it, patient's WBC also
continued to increased (16->38).Repeat abdominal CT scan on HD #
10 revealed slight decrease in fluid component of right
perinephric collection, extensive multi loculated phlegmonous
change with no significant large fluid component to target for
drainage and persistent extensive free intra-abdominal air with
multiple pockets of air  surrounding the second part of
duodenum. The decision was made to take the patient in OR for
washout.
On [**2112-3-20**], the patient underwent wide incision and drainage of
retroperitoneal
abscess/infection/hematoma, [**Location (un) **] patch of potential duodenal
perforation region
with drainage and antecolic isoperistaltic side-to-side
gastrojejunostomy and JP drains placement x 4, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). Intraoperatively patient received 2 units of pRBC, she
was extubated post op and was transferred in ICU for
observation. On POD # 2, patient received 2 units of pRBC for
HCT 23.4, her post transfusion Hct was 28.3. The patient was
transferred to the floor on POD # 3, NPO on TPN and IV fluids,
and Dilaudid PCA for pain control. The patient was continued to
have low grade fever and she was continued on IV Vancomycin,
Zosyn and Fluconazole. The patient was hydrodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient is an active Heroin user. Her pain was
controlled with Dilaudid PCA and she had high requirements for
pain medication. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral Dilaudid and Chronic Pain Service was
consulted. The patient's pain medications was weaned to [**1-14**] gm
of Dilaudid PO Q4H and patient instructed to continue wean off
her pain medications in home.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI: The patient was started on TPN on admission. Her diet was
advanced to clears on HD # 6 and to regular on HD # 8. The
patient was made NPO prior surgery and TPN was continued. Diet
was advanced to clears on POD # 5 and to regular on POD # 9, TPN
was weaned off and d/c/d on POD # 8. The patient was able to
tolerate regular diet prior discharge. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.
Renal/GU: The patient's Cre/BUN were monitored routinely, on HD
# 21 (POD # 10) her Cre increased to 1.9. During hospitalization
patient underwent several abdominal CT scans with contrast, she
received IV Vancomycin x 14 days, and she received IV Toradol
for pain control. The combination of these factors and
inflammatory respond from fluid collection, which lead to mild
right kidney hydronephrosis contributed to patient's acute renal
injury. Urology and Renal were called for consult and their
recommendations were followed. The kidney function started to
improve on POD # 16, and returned to 1.5 prior discharge. The
patient continued to urinate without any difficulties and her
electrolyte balance was generally within normal limits. The
patient will required to have a follow up Renal US to
re-evaluate her hydronephrosis in 6 months as outpatient.
ID: The patient had a positive blood cultures on admission with
STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS, she was treated with IV Vancomycin
for 14 days. Surveillance blood cultures were negative. Intra
abdominal fluid was positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and patient was started
on IV Fluconazole for 14 days also. After discontinue of IV
antibiotics, the patient continued to spike low grade fever and
her increased on POD # 15. Blood and urine cultures were
negative, intra abdominal cultures were positive with [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
The patient was restarted on PO Fluconazole and Augmentin. WBC
and fevers subsided after abx was started. She will continue on
PO Abx for 10 days after discharge. She was discharged with one
JP left within biggest fluid collection, she will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in 2 weeks with Ct scan to evaluate her fluid
collection and possible d/c JP drain.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; she received total 6 units of pRBC during
hospitalization. Her Hct was stable prior discharge and no
further transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.

presents with SVC partial thrombosis now admitted to ICU for
thrombolysis. He has been undergoing XRT and 5-FU which he has
be tolerating well. Over the past 2-3 weeks he has had worsening
chest pain. CTA on [**1-3**] revealed no PE and he was evaluated on
by his thoracic surgeon for incisional pain but it was not felt
to be due to the incisions. He continued to have vague pain
radiating to his shoulders and biceps bilaterally but didn't
notice any facial or arm swelling. There was concern that his
portacath was malfunctioning since it infused well but nursing
had difficulty withdrawing from it so he was sent for portacath
flow study. Study revealed no flow into the SVG with thrombus

Port a cath study-
IMPRESSION:  Left-sided port with diffuse peri-catheter thrombus
including thrombus beyond the distal tip, no antegrade flow from
the port into the superior vena cava.  Findings were discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (un) 5561**] and the patient will be seen in oncology
clinic this day with discussions concerning options such as TPA
through the current port or port removal.


Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo male with hx of rectal CA, DMII, and histoplasmosis now
presents with SVC partial thrombosis now admitted to ICU for
thrombolysis.
.
1. SVC thrombosis-The patient initially presented with vague
chest, shoulder and arm pain. Also, his port was not functioning
well. A subsequent port study showed clot diffuse peri-catheter
thrombus including thrombus beyond the distal tip, no antegrade
flow from the port into the superior vena cava. He may be
hypercoagulable  due to CA. We initially infused tpa at 1mg/hr
for 8 hours followed by another 8 hours of 1/2mg/hr, per IR
protocol. However a subsequent port study showed persistance of
the clot. TPA was stopped. Surgery was consulted and a decision
was made to remove the port. He tolerated the procedure well and
was started on lovenox post-op.

2. Rectal CA-Pt not yet staged. Pt. will continue with continue
XRT as an outpatient. His 5-fu was changed to Xeloda per
HemeOnc. Will hold on XRT per Rad Onc while managing thrombosis
issue.
.
3. DMII- We held glyburide while he was NPO and maintained on a
RISS. His glyburide was restarted after his procedure.

4. Diarrhea- likely related to 5FU. Resolved during his stay.

CXR:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Low lung volumes are noted. This
accentuates
the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly
enlarged. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are likely within normal limits.
The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural
effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary vascular congestion is
present. No acute osseous findings are seen.
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with mild cardiomegaly. No
evidence for
pneumonia.
.
TTE:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Doppler parameters
are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There
is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
not well seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic left ventricular
function. Right ventricular dilation and dysfunction.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
1. Moderate pulmonary hypertension (PAS 50-55 Mean 30)
2. Preserved cardiac output
3. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures without
hemodynamic evidence supporting constriction.
4. No evidence of valvular stenosis.
5. No angiographically-apparent CAD.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
64F DMII on insulin, HTN and HL admitted with junctional rhythm,
hypotension and acute kidney injury in the setting of likely
beta-blocker toxicity. Pt had an episode of acute respiratory
distress during admission requiring intubation.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Junctional rhythm: The patient presented to the ED with HR in
the 50s and BP of 69/54. EKG showed junctional rhythm. She was
given glucagon 5 mg IV x 1 out of concern for beta-blocker
toxicity. In the CCU, 1 mg atropine was administered with good
response and improvement in HR. She was started on an
epinephrine gtt with improvement in HR, dripp was d/c'ed on
[**7-11**]. ECHO [**7-11**] revealed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with hyperdynamic left ventricular function and
right ventricular dilation and dysfunction.
.
# Hypotension: Likely mixed cardiogenic and hypovolemic. She
received ~ 3L of IVF in the ED and additional 1L on presentation
to the CCU. Epinephrine gtt was started with improvement in BP
so d/c'ed on [**7-11**]. AM Cortisol and TSH were normal. TTE showed
hyperdynamic LV function, dilated and depressed contractility of
the RV. Following BP normalization the pt became hypertensive
(see below).
.
# CMP: Pt underwent cardiac cath [**7-12**] as part of work-up for
admission with junctional rhythm, hypotension and abnormal ECHO
with RV dilation. Cath revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension
and elevated right and left sided filling pressures without
hemodynamic evidence supporting constriction. DDx included
restrictive process vs dCHF and pulmonary HTN. No evidence of
valvular stenosis or angiographically-apparent CAD was noted.
Thus, the pt was not placed on ASA. Pt to f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
within the next two weeks. Also, the pt was instructed to
reschedule pulm f/u as she missed her appointment with pulm
while in-patient.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr was 3.3, up from baseline of 1.1 in [**Month (only) 956**]. K was
4.2, BUN 67. Likely prerenal from volume depletion given history
of nausea/vomiting x 1 week. Cr stabilized over the course of
the hospitalization. Appropriate medications were renally dosed.
[**Last Name (un) **] was discontinued during hospitalization with plans for
further discussion as outpatient for restarting given pt with hx
of DMII.
.
# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Likely due to a
combination of flash pulmonary edema and anxiety. In the
afternoon of [**7-11**], pt became acutely dyspneic and tachypneic.
She had bilateral diffuse crackles and CXR showing diffuse
bilateral infiltrates. She was given morphine 2mg IV x2, Lasix
40mg IV x1 and started on a nitro gtt. Pt was also placed on
CPAP however had difficulty tolerating and began to tire with an
ABG 7.23/42/89/18/-9. Anesthesia attempted intubation but had
initial difficulty and pt desatted, briefly became hypotensive
to the 60s, and had junctional rhythm in the 20s. She was given
atropine x1 with increase of HR to 110s and SBP to the 160s. Pt
was successfully intubated. After aggressive diuresis (out 3L),
pt was successfully extubated in the PM of [**7-12**] with no further
episodes of distress. The pt will be calling to schedule f/u up
with pulm in 2 weeks time.
.
# Hypertension: After d/c of epi gtt, pt's BPs elevated to the
160s. After starting pt on 25mg HCTZ (home dose), 10mg
Amlodipine, metoprolol 25 mg po BID, and aggressive diuresis,
BPs improved although still elevated. Losartan was held to
simplify home regimen and decrease risk of future incidence of
renal failure in setting of vomitting and diarrhea.
.
# Microcytic anemia: Hct was 25.5 on admission. Iron studies
consistent with AOCD.  EGD in [**2124**] showed gastritis which could
represent mixed iron deficiency and AOCD.  Guiaic negative in
the ED. Retic count was depressed at 1.6%. Hemolysis labs were
negative. Hct remained stable.
**The etiology of the patients AOCD remained unclear at the time
of discharge and should be further pursed as an outpatient**
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Type 2 DM: Blood sugars were initially low normal. Her sugars
were well-controlled on an insulin sliding scale.  Home dose of
NPH was held due to episode of hypoglycemia (BG=59). Pt
discharged on [**Last Name (un) **] humalin regimen.
.
# HLD: Continued simvastatin 20 mg po qdaily
.
# Depression: Continued on sertraline 150mg po daily.
Desipramine 100 mg was held during hospitalization but resumed
on discharge.
.
# Chronic back pain: Percocet 1-2 tabs po q6 prn pain while in
house. Pt continued on Oxycontin 10mg [**Hospital1 **] on d/c. (Pt on
contract).
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Full Code. Pt was given phone numbers for cardiology and
pulmonary and must call to make f/u appointments. A medication
list (and actual bottles) were reviewed with pt and her daughter
prior to discharge. Pt will have visiting nursing care for
medication management post hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure caring for you at the [**Hospital1 827**]. Your blood pressure and heart rate were low
because you had too much atenolol (a beta-blocker) in your
system in the setting of decreased blood flow to your kidney
potentially caused by another medication (valsartan or
losartan). You subsequently had trouble breathing and needed to
to be intubated. You had a cardiac catheterization which showed
no evidence of coronary artery disease.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
1) Stop taking atenolol and instead start taking metoprolol
tartrate 50mg by mouth twice a day to better control your blood
pressure.

2) Stop taking Losartan and Valsartan

3) Start taking Amlodipine 10 mg by mouth once daily to help
control your blood pressure.

History of Present Illness:
34 yo male with a history of narcotic abuse who was attempting
to detox himself at home who presented to OSH ED with altered
MS.  Following history from patient's parents:  He had been on
OxyContin  80-100 mg tid for ~1 year. On Monday (2d pta) he
began an outpatient detox program (Primary Care Associates
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **]).  Medications listed below, he was given a 1d
prescription and the medications were administered by his
mother.  On the 1st night he was restless and did not sleep
well, therefore on Tuesday his regimen was changed to an
increased dose of doxepin, librium, and neurontin and ambien and
baclofen were added.  Last night, he was well at 10pm, then his
parents were awoken by the alarm system and found [**Known firstname 17766**] in the
garage - he was agitated and delerius.  They called the
treatment program who recommended they take him to the ED.  At
[**Hospital1 46**], he was agitated, HR 120-130s, SBP 130-150s.  He was
given ativan, fentanyl, haldol, versed and was eventually
intubated and paralyzed (given etomidate, succinylcholine).
Also given banana bag and ancef (unclear etiology).  Of note,
parents are reasonably sure that he did not take any medications
other than those prescribed by the detox program - in the house
they have Tylenol, Lipitor, Detrol.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt came intubated and sedated with propofol into the ICU.
The pt was not responsive and did not follow commands. He moved
all four extremities and did not seem in any acute distress. The
pt was switched from AC to CPAP with mmHg of PS before he
extubated himself about one hour into his stay in the ICU. He
was able to maintain good saturations and did not have any
respiratory distress. The propofol was stopped and the pt was
put on lorazepam for sedation. He was able to follow commands
and was orientated to time and person. He did not answer any
questions about the medications he took, but denied taking any
additional drugs apart from the ones that were prescribed for
detoxication.  The pt was kept on supportive care to allow time
for the metabolism of the drug OD.

Later in his admission the patient became agitated and
disoriented.  It was unclear as to whether this was stil related
to his initial drug intoxication or if he was undergoing
possible withdrawal.  It was also possible that the patient was
oversedated from the large quantities of ativan he had received
since admission.
The dose of Ativan was reduced and Haldol was added to the
regimen.

On day three of the hospital course the patient became oriented
X3 and was now following commands appropriately.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 59777**] is a 44 year old female with a history of recently
diagnosed stage IV non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to
brain, adrenals, and kidneys who presents with complaints of
blood when she urinates. She notes that she first noticed this
two days ago. She also notes pain with urination since she
noticed the blood. She ntes it has been the worst between 1 am
and 5 am where she can't leave the BR due to constant need to
urinate. She also urinates several times during the day.  Each
time is extremely painful. She notes that since the bleeding
began, the pain has begun to improve but the bleeding has
continued at the same frequency.  She denies any vaginal
bleeding, melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 98.3, 108/70, 96, 18, 100% RA.  While in the ED
she was noted to have frank hematuria. Pelvic exam was performed
without evidence of vaginal or cervical bleeding. No obvious GI
bleeding was noted. She was guiaic negative. Labs were
remarkable for Hct drop from 34->20 over 1 month. Coags, WBC,
and plts normal. Electrolytes showed new renal failure with
BUN/Cr 46/2.3 from 14/0.6 1 month prior. K was 6.0, bicarb 17.
U/A revealed >50 RBCs, 21-50 WBCs, LE and nitrite negative, and
no bacteria.   She received 30 grams of kayexalate, 10 mg of
dexamethasone, zofran, and morphine.  Prior to floor transfer,
she lost her IV access. Bilateral femoral CVLs were attempted
but wire could not be passed. She then had a successful R IJ CVL
placement.

Currently, she feels well.  Episode of frank hematuria witnessed
upon arrival to the floor, also notable for stringlike clot. On
ROS, she denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, DOE.  She
does note increased fatigue and recent poor po intake. She also
notes intermittent nausea when taking her medications.  She
denies any numbness or tingling, weakness, or confusion. Denies
any muscle or joint pains which the exception of chronic R thumb
pain which improved with steroids and has worsened with taper.
All other ROS negative.

Past Oncologic history:
Initially presented in [**2-/2184**] with complaints of weight loss,
nausea and vomiting.  It seems that her symptoms were initially
mild.  She did not have shortness of breath, cough or other
complaints at that time.  By [**3-/2184**], she continued to lose
weight and was found to have a potential right-sided dental
abscess.  She was treated for that empirically with antibiotics
and continued to have weight loss, diarrhea.  It seems that in
the end of [**Month (only) 958**] and beginning of [**5-/2184**], the patient
represented to medical attention with mild shortness of
breath with exertion and chest discomfort.  She also had noted
at that point subjective low-grade temperatures and some cough
productive of brown sputum.  In [**5-/2184**], she already had a
20-pound weight loss.  During the initial presentation, she also
complained of one episode of hemoptysis with production of more
than one teaspoon of blood. Due to the above-mentioned symptoms,
the patient underwent a computer tomography of the chest on
[**2184-5-14**] that disclosed a 2.6 cm cavitary lesion in the
posterior right upper lobe with additional smaller right-sided
pulmonary nodules and extensive right hilar lymphadenopathy with
marked narrowing of the hilar airways and vessels. At that
point, further staging imaging was obtained with a computer
tomography of the torso on [**2184-5-29**] that disclosed the chest
findings as detailed above.  There was also right upper lobe
pulmonary interstitial thickening, which was worrisome for
lymphangitic spread.  There was a subtle sclerosis of the T4
vertebral body.  There was no evidence of extrathoracic disease.
 The adrenals had 2 cm masses.  There were multiple enlarged
retroperitoneal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm. An MRI of
head was performed on [**2184-5-29**] and showed multiple areas of
enhancement identifying with surrounding edema in both cerebral
hemispheres as well as in the posterior fossa.  The largest
lesion measured 1.5 cm in the left frontal lobe. The patient had
had some intermittent headaches that were thought to be
migraines at that point.  However, she had no problems with
motor strength up to the time of initial MRI when she developed
some gait instability and required a cane.  She also complained
of intermittent blurry vision.  She was diagnosed the etiology
of the brain lesions.  A brain biopsy was performed on
[**2184-5-30**].  Multiple fragments were obtained.  All showed small
nests of large cell undifferentiated carcinoma throughout brain
lesions.  D cells were positive for CK7 and TTF1. Due to the
presence of nonsmall cell lung cancer with brain metastasis and
edema, the patient was referred to neurooncology and radiation
oncology.  Whole brain radiation was started on [**2184-6-5**].  The
patient received 3000 cGy to the brain.  She was also started on
dexamethasone.  Her last day of radiation was [**2184-6-15**].  She has
most recently been on a steroid taper. She is currently in the
planning stages of palliative chemotherapy.

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 1411**] with fiance and three children. The patient
started smoking cigarettes at age 13. ~45-pack-year history.  No
history of alcohol use.  She has a remote history of prior
intravenous drug use and cocaine use.  Originally from Sicily.
Moved to USA in [**2135**]. She worked as a domestic cleaner and had
some exposure to areas affected by asbestos and heavy chemicals.
 She currently is out of work and living with family members.

Family History:

Imaging:
========
CXR ([**7-10**]):
IMPRESSION: Development of focal area of increased density in
the right mid
lung consistent with atelectasis or consolidation. PA and
lateral views may
be helpful for further evaluation.

Renal US [**7-9**]:
1. Multiple bilateral hypoechoic renal masses, consistent with
known
metastases.
2. Doppler ultrasound demonstrates rapid systolic upstrokes,
with impaired
diastolic flow, and elevated resistive indices. The main renal
veins are
patent. These findings most likely reflect increased vascular
resistance
secondary to mass effect of multiple metastatic lesions. There
is no evidence for renal vein thrombosis.

CXR [**7-8**]:
Tip of the new right internal jugular line projects over the low
SVC.
Mediastinal widening and right hilar enlargement due to
adenopathy are stable. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Lungs are grossly clear. Heart size normal.

ECG [**7-7**]: NSR @ 83.  Nl axis and intervals. Isolated < 1 mm STE
in aVF. Compared to prior [**2184-5-30**], no sig change.

renal u/s [**7-7**]: Both kidneys enlarged and heterogeneous. Both
contain multiple masses with indistinct borders, some appear
hypervascular. No hydronephrosis. Echogenic lesion in bladder
likely representing blood clot.

Pelvic US [**7-7**]:

CT torso [**6-30**]:
1. Slight decrease in the size of right upper lobe lung nodules.
There has been no substantial change in the appearance of the
hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2. Slight increase in the size of the bilateral adrenal lesions.

3. Increase in confluence and increase in size of some of the
bilateral renal lesions. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric
lymphadenopathy as before.

[**6-30**] bone scan:
No evidence of osseous metastatic disease. Abnormal uptake in
the
kidneys bilaterally. Recommend correlation with additional
anatomic imaging, such as ultrasound, as clinically indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
44F with metastatic NSCLC (brain, bilat adrenals, bilat kidneys)
p/w frank hematuria, anemia, renal failure. The bleeding was
from renal mets and was localized to the L kidney based on blood
seen coming from the L ureter at cystoscopy. The renal failure
was believed to be due to a combination of ATN, mets, and
contrast. Ultimately she was started on HD. The L kidney was
embolized to prevent further bleeding. She is now HD dependent.
Her hospitalization has been further complicated by pneumonia
and adrenal insufficiency.

Ultimately, after a trial of dialysis, the pt opted to be CMO.
However, when she did not pass over a weekend, she considered
this a sign that she could live longer and possbily survive
cancer. A family meeting was convened and an accommodation was
achieved wherein we would restart abx and try to relieve her of
her anasarca using either diuretics or ultrafiltration. That
said, after failing diuretics and prolonged difficulties with
the dialysis catheter, another meeting was convened. Antibiotics
were stopped again and the patient was returned to [**Location 3225**] with
ultrafiltration. During an ultrafiltration treatment, she went
into respiratory failure and passed.

Medications on Admission:
albuterol prn
dexamethasone 1 mg four times daily (decreased [**7-5**], due to drop

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 50 year-old right-handed man with a recent
history of HSV encephalitis who presents with worsening speech
difficulties and decreased movement of the right arm.  He was
initially diagnosed with HSV 1 meningitis on [**2190-4-23**].  He
presented after he was in an accident while driving from RI to
VT, rented a second car, and was in a second accident, at which
point he was brought to an outside hospital and eventually
diagnosed with HSV meningitis.  He was started on a course of IV
acyclovir, and discharged to [**Hospital 38**] rehab.  His rehab course
was complicated by a lower extremity DVT, for which he was
started on Coumadin, however on [**5-15**] there was concern that the
clot was mobile, and on [**2190-5-16**] he had an IVC filter placed.
Around this time he became febrile to 102.6, and on [**5-18**] was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for fever and worsening confusion.  He was
admitted from [**Date range (1) 66375**], during which time he underwent a repeat
LP, which showed 56 WBCs and a protein of 83, but was HSV
negative.  He had blood and urine cultures that were also
negative.  His fevers resolved with restarting acyclovir, though
his mental status continued to fluctuate, and he was sent back
to
rehab on [**5-21**].  His sister continued to visit him, and reports
that even as recently as two days ago he was actually starting
to
improve.  At his best he was reported to be communicative, with
a
slightly strange affect, and mild short term memory and
executive
function impairment.  However, on [**5-26**] he was noted to be very
unsteady with PT, and was found to be orthostatic as low of SBP
of 60 when standing, and it was recommended that he start both
fludrocortisone and midodrine.  On [**5-27**] the patient was noted to
be forcibly keeping his right eye closed, and also was felt to
be
more apraxic with worsening coordination.  He was also felt to
not be moving his right arm as frequently.  For all of this he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Exam fluctuates significantly throughout.
Alert,
oriented to self but states it is [**Month (only) 956**], then starts reciting
[**2184**]..[**2185**]..[**2186**] when asked the year.  Later can state [**2190**] and
that the president is [**Last Name (un) 2753**].  States he is at [**Hospital 38**] Rehab.
Has intermittent dysarthria, most notable with '[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]' '[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]' and
'ka'
sounds, but this fluctuates.  Can follow simple midline and
appendicular commands, though with two step commands, such as
'take your left hand and touch your right ear' looks at his left
hand, picks it up, then holds it over his head.  When asked what
he is supposed to be doing states 'I'm supposed to touch my
right
ear' but never actually does it, and when asked a minute later
what he is supposed to be doing states 'picking my nose' (still
with his left arm held suspended above his head).  Able to read,
though periodically adds the word 'hospital' into sentences (e.g
'near the table in the hospital dining room').  Can name the
key,
glove and feather on the stroke card, but says 'tetanus with a
shower in between' for the cactus, a nonsensical word for the
chair and 'nice...a mattress' for the hammock.  Able to count to
20 forwards, but when counting backwards makes it to 12, then
repeats 12, 13, 12, 11, 12, 13.... When asked to repeat a second
time does the exact same thing.  Unable to register even 1 of 3
objects.  Is able to register my name, but when asked to produce
it ~3 minutes later, pauses, and then names a friend of his, who
he states looks like me.  Has difficulty describing the events
of
his recent hospitalization, but is able to provide appropriate
history prior to his illness (information about his life in
[**Location (un) 7188**], his sister's family and his nephew, all confirmed by
his
sister).

II: PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk.  Keeps right eye squinted shut.
Able to grossly count fingers in all quadrants with the left
eye,
and will look towards a moving finger in all fields, though will
not fully cooperate with more formal testing.
III, IV, VI: Will track objects to the right without difficulty,
though takes significant prompting, including a $5 [**Doctor First Name **] to look
over to the left, and even then does not fully bury the sclera
of
the left eye.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: Left sided facial droop, and right eye slightly squinted at
rest, though can open it volitionally.  Intermittent twitching
of

IMAGING:
MRI/A BRAIN [**2190-6-1**]
Bilateral temporal lobe enhancing signal abnormality with also
extension into the bilateral insula and right cingulate gyrus.
Encephalomalacic changes in the right temporal lobe suggest that
this represents an acute on chronic infectious process, on the
left, this appears to be acute.
No evidence for acute ischemia or hydrocephalus.
Unremarkable MRA of the head and neck.

MRI C-SPINE
1. No abnormal spinal cord signal or enhancement to suggest an
inflammatory process within the spinal cord. No evidence of
osteomyelitis, discitis or epidural abscess.
2. Degenerative changes, particularly at C5-C6, where there is
high-grade
spinal canal narrowing.

MRI BRAIN [**2190-6-20**]
Substantial progression of brain abnormalities, which remain
compatible with the stated clinical diagnosis of herpes simplex
encephalitis.

MRI BRAIN [**2190-7-8**]
Unchanged encephalomalacia of the right temporal lobe with
interval decrease in the extent of white matter edema in the
brain. No areas of enhancement.

MRI BRAIN [**2190-7-12**]
Stable appearances of the diffuse white matter FLAIR
hyperintensities since [**2190-7-8**], however, improved signal
changes since [**2190-6-20**]. White matter signal changes could
reflect two seizure episodes. Stable
encephalomalacia in the right temporal lobe and enhancement
along the right mesial temporal lobes and right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]
matter. No new intracranial abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO:
SEIZURES:
On initial EEG, he was thought to be in complex partial status,
and was
given a trial of ativan with electrographic and clinical
improvement. He was increased on his Keppra from 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] to
1500 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He continued to have frequent R temporal
complex partial seizures, characterized by focal rhythmic theta
activity.  Clinically, the seizures were characterized by L hand
twitching movements, R facial twitching, and confusion.
On [**5-29**], He was loaded on phosphenytoin and started on
maintenance
dosing with improvement in seizure frequency.  On [**6-1**], he was
loaded on vimpat 200 mg IV, and started on maintenance of 100 mg
[**Hospital1 **].

Patient had a very complicated course with many antiepileptic
medications trialed.

He was initially transferred to the ICU for hypotension and
respiratory distress.
His seizures were controlled with midazolam, then he was
switched to propofol because midazolam was not providing
sufficient sedation, and this was also effective in suppressing
seizures. He then began having frequent nonconvulsive seizures,
and was started on phenobarbital [**6-6**], and Depakote on [**6-9**]. He
underwent trach and PEG [**6-11**]. Zonisamide and Topamax were also
tried. He temporarily was able to be transferred to the
neurology step down unit, but returned to the ICU for midazolam
drip on [**2190-7-4**].

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus remained refractory.  The
seizures continued to originate from bilateral temporal lobes
despite increasing serum levels of Dilantin (corrected 20-25)
and phenobarbital (90-100) and midazolam drip.

HSV ENCEPHALITIS:
Patient had severe HSV encephalitis resulting in necrosis and
cystic changes in bilateral temporal lobes. Serial MRIs also
showed development of extensive vasogenic edema in bilateral
cortices. There was concern for ADEM process, and patient was
treated with 5 days high dose steroids. Repeat MRI did show
improvement in the diffuse edema after steroids. Another repeat
MRI done several days after stopping steroids appeared stable
with no further improvement but no worsening. It was impossible
to determine if the steroids would have improved his mental
status, this the timing coincided with worsening of his seizures
and starting midazolam drip. On [**2190-7-21**], a family meeting
was held with the epilepsy team, palliative care, and the SICU
team. It was decided that the patient would not want to go on
with his current quality of life. It was then decided to make
the patient comfort-measures-only with continuation of the
antiepileptics and to pursue extubation on Friday [**7-23**]. The
patient maintained off of intubation for several hours but
ultimately passed away Friday night.

ID:
1. HSV ENCEPHALITIS- ID was consulted on admission. Patient has
completed 2 21 day courses of acyclovir. Repeat CSF HSV PCR was
negative x 2. He underwent thorough workup for other coexisting
viral infections which was negative (HIV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HTLV1,
[**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus). HIV viral load was also negative, so patient could
not possibly be in the ""window period"" of acute infection. HSV
culture was also negative from the CSF, so there was no evidence
that the type of HSV was resistant to acyclovir, and thus no
additional antiviral treatment was warranted. Brain biopsy was
discussed several times throughout his course, but ultimately
decided that there would be no diagnostic or therapeutic
advantage from this.

2. FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN-
Patient developed fever to 102 daily. He was initially treated
with empiric course of vanco/zosyn but fevers persisted with no
clear source and all cultures negative. ID ultimately thought
this was either drug or central fever. He did also develop a
mild maculopapular rash and elevated eosinophil count, which
point toward drug fever. His seizure medications were likely
culprit, but could not be stopped due to nonconvulsive status.
The rash improved on its own and the fevers continued until
discharge.

3. LYMPHOPENIA/LOW CD4 COUNT
Patient developed lymphopenia and low CD 4 count (212 on [**7-5**]).
This caused concern for HIV, but HIV antibodies and viral load
were negative. Other possible causes such as CMV and HTLV1 were
also negative. This may be due to chronic illness and bone
marrow suppression from HSV infection.

4. UTI
Urine culture from [**7-9**] grew >100,000 E coli, treated with
ceftriaxone.

5. PNA
Sputum culture from [**7-9**] grew Klebsiella, treated with
ceftriaxone.

GI:
TRANAMINITIS- Patient had normal LFTs on admission but developed
elevation in AST/ALT to 300-400 with no elevated bilirubin but
with elevated ammonia. This was likely a medication side effect,
and improved with stopping Depakote.
There was then a second episode of LFT elevation that resolved
with stopping zonisamide.

HEME:
1. DVT-
 His prior rehab course was complicated by a lower extremity DVT
and he was started on Coumadin. However, on [**5-15**] there was
concern that the clot was mobile, and on [**2190-5-16**] he had an IVC
filter placed. He was treated with therapeutic doses of Lovenox
during this hospitalization, since coumadin was interacting with
AEDs.

2. Anemia
Hematocrit gradually trended down during admission from 33 at
admission to 25. Hematology was consulted. There was no evidence
of hemolysis or any other acute concerning process on peripheral
smear. Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency so he
was started on ferrous sulfate daily. There was also likely
contribution of bone marrow suppression from medications.

RENAL:
Acute kidney injury- likely due to acyclovir and hypotension on
sedation and AEDs. Resolved.

Medications on Admission:
- Colace 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
- Finasteride 5mg daily
- Fludrocortisone 0.1mg daily
- Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **]

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Transplant Surgery Service.  The patient was kept
nothing by mouth and was consented for a liver transplant.

The patient had the operation on the day after admission.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient received morphine as needed
for pain.  The patient was continued on Unasyn, Bactrim,
fluconazole, and ganciclovir and was put on CellCept and
Solu-Medrol for immunosuppression.

On postoperative day two, the patient had no acute
complaints.  The patient was stable.  The patient continued
to be nothing by mouth with a nasogastric tube in place.  The
patient had a Foley and was doing well.  The patient's right
internal jugular cordis was changed over wire to triple lumen
catheter without any difficulties, and the patient was
extubated.

The patient's issues on postoperative day three were
bradycardia and the patient was hypertensive, most likely due
to the increase in the patient's volume from the surgery.
The patient was still intubated and kept nothing by mouth
with intravenous fluids.  The patient was given Lasix for
diuresis.  The patient's perioperative antibiotics were
discontinued, and he was Heplocked.  The patient was
transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day four, the patient was complaining of
some pain at the incision site on the back.  The patient
remained afebrile and continued to be somewhat hypertensive.
The patient was advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.  The
patient was also on ............ of 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] and
prednisone, and Neoral for immunosuppression.

On postoperative day five, the patient had no complaints.  He
remained afebrile.  He continued to be somewhat hypertensive.
The patient was continued on a prednisone taper.  The
patient's Foley was removed and Heplocked.  He was encouraged
to be out of bed and ambulate.

On postoperative day six, the patient remained afebrile and
somewhat hypertensive.  With elevated blood sugars we
obtained [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation to monitor the patient's
sugars, and the patient was continued on a prednisone taper,
and CellCept, and Neoral.

On postoperative day seven, the patient had no complaints.
The patient was doing well.  The patient continued to be out
of bed with ambulation.  He was taking good oral intake.

On postoperative day eight, the patient was doing well.  He
remained afebrile with stable vital signs.  The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were both removed without any
difficulties.  However, the patient's liver function tests
were elevated from the previous day.  Obtained a liver biopsy
which showed mild to severe rejection, focal acute
cholangitis and focal lobular neutrophilic aggregates and
mild ............ perfusion injury.  The patient was promptly
put on Solu-Medrol 500 mg intravenously times three to treat
the acute cellular rejection.

On postoperative day number nine, the patient had no
complaints.  He remained afebrile with stable vital signs. He
was doing well on the high-dose steroids.  The patient's
blood sugars were well controlled, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] input.

On postoperative day ten, the patient completed his last dose
of Solu-Medrol and was put on a by mouth form of steroid
taper.  The patient's liver function tests had improved on
the Solu-Medrol and continued to do well from that aspect.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the West 2b service on [**2154-1-1**].
Initially patient was managed in the ICU and kept NPO/IVF and
pain was treated. On [**1-4**], patient was deemed stable to come to
the floor after pancreatic labs and bilirubin began to trend
down.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout his
hospitalization; In the ED, patient was given IV Dilaudid for
pain with good effect. Upon transfer to the unit, fentanyl was
started due to rash from Dilaudid. This seemed to control the
patient's pain well. When patient transferred to floor, Pain
service was consulted to control pain. They recommended Roxicet,
which provided good relief for the patient.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint. Vital signs were routinely monitored. BP was
slightly low in the ED with SBP in the high 90, however this
improved substantially with adequate hydration.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Patient was kept nothing by mouth with intravenous
fluid upon admission to the hospital, but was advanced to stage
3 upon transfer to the general surgical [**Hospital1 **], which he tolerated
without increased pain or nausea. CT scan was performed in the
ED which showed acute uncomplicated pancreatitis and
cholelithiasis, but no signs of cholecystitis. Large ventral
hernia was also seen on CT scan. Labs were trended throughout
hospital course, which showed continuous drop in pancreatic
enzymes. However bilirubin continued to rise with a peak total
bilirubin of 4.4 on HD. ERCP was consulted, but they were unable
to perform the procedure due to patient's altered anatomy from
bypass surgery. MRCP on [**1-3**] showed no intra or extrahepatic
dilation, and no stone was seen. Bilirubin and other labs
continued to trend down and patient was transferred to the floor
on [**1-4**]. Labs continued to trend downward throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization;
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of
infection, of which there were none. Patient was not started on
any antibiotics upon admission to the hospital.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and [**Last Name (un) **]
dyne boots were used during this stay; he was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a stage 3
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.  He will return for an open
cholecystectomy and hernia repair on [**2154-1-14**].
